1	AFP_ENG_20030226.0513.LDC2007T07	The international Red Cross on Wednesday repatriated 100 Moroccan prisoners of war who had been held by Polisario Front separatists who want independence for Western Sahara, the Sahrawi SPS news agency reported.
2	AFP_ENG_20030226.0513.LDC2007T07	Polisario announced the release of the prisoners in a gesture of goodwill to mark a Muslim feast day on February 11.
3	AFP_ENG_20030226.0513.LDC2007T07	The Moroccan government says more than 1,100 soldiers captured by the Polisario Front during clashes in the Western Sahara between 1975 -- when the disputed territory was annexed by Morocco on gaining independence from Spain -- and the early 1980s are still detained by the politico-guerrilla movement.
4	AFP_ENG_20030226.0513.LDC2007T07	The men repatriated Wednesday by the International Committee of the Red Cross were freed by Polisario, which has proclaimed a Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR) in the disputed territory, after intervention by Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar.
5	AFP_ENG_20030226.0513.LDC2007T07	A Moroccan newspaper close to the government, Le Matin, dismissed the Polisario announcement as "political marketing" and "cynical blackmail".
6	AFP_ENG_20030226.0513.LDC2007T07	The PoWs still in Polisario hands are in sprawling prisoner of war camps in the Tindouf region of Algeria, across the border from the disputed territory, where the United Nations has for more than a decade run up against obstacles from either side to its efforts to organise a referendum on self-determination.
7	AFP_ENG_20030226.0513.LDC2007T07	In January 2002, the Polisario Front freed 115 Moroccan troops following intervention by Aznar, and five months later another 101 men were released after similar moves by German secretary of state for foreign affairs Juergen Chrobog.

9	AFP_ENG_20031221.0338.LDC2007T07	Gulf Arab leaders opened their annual summit here Sunday with a call by Kuwait's premier to fight terror, and welcoming the capture of former Iraqi president Saddam Hussein.
10	AFP_ENG_20031221.0338.LDC2007T07	Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmad al-Sabah, who opened the summit on behalf of the ailing Emir Sheikh Jaber al-Ahmad al-Sabah, also said that trying the former Iraqi strongman would consolidate security and stability in Iraq.
11	AFP_ENG_20031221.0338.LDC2007T07	The summit is the first to be held by the Gulf alliance since last April's US-led overthrow of Saddam, who was captured by US forces a week ago.
12	AFP_ENG_20031221.0338.LDC2007T07	"Terrorism has expanded and spread to most parts of the world and to some of our states.
13	AFP_ENG_20031221.0338.LDC2007T07	This requires that we close ranks and step up regional and international efforts to confront and combat terror," Sheikh Sabah said.
14	AFP_ENG_20031221.0338.LDC2007T07	Fighting against terrorism, especially after deadly suicide bombings in Saudi Arabia and shootings in Kuwait, and developments in Iraq after the US-led overthrow of Saddam, top the agenda of the two-day meeting.
15	AFP_ENG_20031221.0338.LDC2007T07	The leaders of the six Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) member states are expected to approve a joint agreement on combating terror.
16	AFP_ENG_20031221.0338.LDC2007T07	The GCC comprises the gas- and oil-rich states of Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE).
17	AFP_ENG_20031221.0338.LDC2007T07	The five-minute opening session was marked by the absence of Kuwait's emir who earlier in the day was at the airport to receive all delegates.
18	AFP_ENG_20031221.0338.LDC2007T07	Sheikh Sabah said developments in Iraq will have a far-reaching and direct impact on the Gulf states, "which should closely monitor these events" and prepare for all eventualities.
19	AFP_ENG_20031221.0338.LDC2007T07	"While following the developments and changes in Iraq very closely, we hope it will be a prelude for a new phase that lays the foundations for a new political era in which the Iraqi people rebuild their country," he said.
20	AFP_ENG_20031221.0338.LDC2007T07	The Kuwaiti premier also blasted the Israeli "oppressive measures" against the Palestinian people, saying they "constitute a threat to the security and stability of the whole area," and abort efforts for a just peace.
21	AFP_ENG_20031221.0338.LDC2007T07	The summit is being held amid heightened security with hundreds of tanks and armoured vehicles and thousands of soldiers deployed to guard the conference venue of Bayan Palace, south of Kuwait City, and surrounding areas.
22	AFP_ENG_20031221.0338.LDC2007T07	Former GCC secretary general Abdullah Bishara has urged the leaders to upgrade their internal security, cut dependence on the United States and establish normal ties with Iraq and Iran.
23	AFP_ENG_20031221.0338.LDC2007T07	Two Kuwaiti Islamist groups, the Islamic Constitutional Movement and the Salaf Movement, in separate statements Sunday, called on the leaders to reject US military bases in the region and to embrace fundamental political reforms.
24	AFP_ENG_20031221.0338.LDC2007T07	Kuwait's Al-Taleea weekly, mouthpiece of the liberal Kuwait Democratic Forum, said the GCC "must either live up to the peoples' aspirations or sign its death certificate."
25	AFP_ENG_20031221.0338.LDC2007T07	A charter for educational reforms aimed at "reformulating school curricula" in member states and preventing youths from being influenced by extremist ideologies is expected to be approved.
26	AFP_ENG_20031221.0338.LDC2007T07	Economic issues will be high on the agenda with the leaders expected to review progress made toward monetary union, a single currency and a common market amid wide criticism of slow-paced implementation.
27	AFP_ENG_20031221.0338.LDC2007T07	The leaders will examine obstacles facing the customs union which was launched on January 1.
28	AFP_ENG_20031221.0338.LDC2007T07	They will also study a number of major projects like a railway linking GCC states in the first phase and later with Iraq.

33	AFP_ENG_20070102.0312.LDC2009T13	German industrial group Siemens is being investigated on suspicion of corruption in the oil-for-food programme in Iraq, the Financial Times Deutschland claimed on Tuesday.
34	AFP_ENG_20070102.0312.LDC2009T13	The paper, which released an advance extract of its Wednesday edition, quoted a spokesman for the state prosecutor in Nuremberg as saying: "The prosecutor is investigating whether Siemens contravened the law on foreign trade."
35	AFP_ENG_20070102.0312.LDC2009T13	The spokesman said the allegations against Siemens concerned mainly its energy and medical equipment operations and involved a six-figure sum, meaning at least 100,000 euros (133,000 dollars).
36	AFP_ENG_20070102.0312.LDC2009T13	The money was allegedly paid as a bribe to Saddam Hussein's regime to secure contracts as part of the UN-supervised food-for- oil programme which ran from late-1996 to 2003.
37	AFP_ENG_20070102.0312.LDC2009T13	The programme allowed the Iraqi government to sell limited amounts of oil to purchase essential goods to alleviate the effects of sanctions on the civilian population.
38	AFP_ENG_20070102.0312.LDC2009T13	In late December, state prosecutors in Munich said they had opened an investigation into German oil giant Linde, which faces similar accusations over the food-for-oil programme.
39	AFP_ENG_20070102.0312.LDC2009T13	An investigation ordered by UN Secretary General Kofi Annan found in 2005 that more than 2,000 companies from 60 countries bribed Saddam Hussein's government to be allowed to take part in the programme.
40	AFP_ENG_20070102.0312.LDC2009T13	Siemens is also facing an investigation by German prosecutors over alleged embezzlement, bribery and tax evasion.
41	AFP_ENG_20070102.0312.LDC2009T13	Some employees are suspected of collaborating in opening slush fund accounts abroad, which are used for making illicit payments, and of operating a system to embezzle company money.
42	AFP_ENG_20070102.0312.LDC2009T13	Seven former and current employees were arrested late last year but freed before Christmas after they made statements to prosecutors.
43	AFP_ENG_20070104.0548.LDC2009T13	Bush to appoint new Iraq commanders
44	AFP_ENG_20070104.0548.LDC2009T13	US President George W. Bush reportedly plans to appoint two top new commanders for Iraq before unveiling a shift in strategy for the strife-torn nation that may include increasing the number of US troops.
45	AFP_ENG_20070104.0548.LDC2009T13	The US television network ABC said Thursday that Bush intends to nominate Admiral William Fallon, head of US Pacific Command, to replace General John Abizaid at US Central Command, which has responsibility for the Middle East.
46	AFP_ENG_20070104.0548.LDC2009T13	It said General George Casey, the US military commander in Iraq, would be replaced by Lieutenant General David Petraeus, who has played a major role in the training of Iraqi security forces.
47	AFP_ENG_20070104.0548.LDC2009T13	Abizaid, 55, announced last month that he planned to retire early this year and ABC said Casey, 58, would probably leave in the next few months, earlier than a planned June departure.
48	AFP_ENG_20070104.0548.LDC2009T13	"The president wants a clean sweep," an unidentified US official told ABC.
49	AFP_ENG_20070104.0548.LDC2009T13	Both Abizaid and Casey have expressed reservations about a reported plan to increase the number of US troops in Iraq from the current 140,000.
50	AFP_ENG_20070104.0548.LDC2009T13	According to US media reports, Bush could announce an increase of US forces in Iraq on the order of 9,000 to 40,000 extra troops in a bid to end sectarian strife and restore security.
51	AFP_ENG_20070104.0548.LDC2009T13	ABC said the military nominations would be announced next week, before Bush delivers his speech on strategy for an increasingly unpopular US war in Iraq that has cost the lives of some 3,000 US servicemen.
52	AFP_ENG_20070104.0548.LDC2009T13	As a naval officer, ABC said the appointment of Fallon to head Central Command and oversee ground wars in Iraq and Afghanistan would be "highly unusual."
53	AFP_ENG_20070104.0548.LDC2009T13	The appointments come as Bush pursues an aggressive overhaul among his top military, diplomatic and intelligence aides.
54	AFP_ENG_20070104.0548.LDC2009T13	He is expected to announce Friday that he is moving Director of National Intelligence John Negroponte to the State Department as deputy to Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice.
55	AFP_ENG_20070104.0548.LDC2009T13	He also will nominate next week Zalmay Khalilzad, the US ambassador to Iraq, to be the new top US diplomat at the United Nations, a senior US official said.
56	AFP_ENG_20070104.0548.LDC2009T13	The appointments are subject to Senate confirmation.
57	AFP_ENG_20070104.0548.LDC2009T13	Fallon, 62, who is tipped to replace Abizaid, was a navy combat pilot during the Vietnam War, commanded an attack squadron during the first Gulf War in 1991 and was involved in NATO's Operation Deliberate Force in Bosnia.
58	AFP_ENG_20070104.0548.LDC2009T13	As head of Central Command, he would oversee US forces from North Africa to Central Asia.
59	AFP_ENG_20070104.0548.LDC2009T13	Petraeus, 54, currently serves as the commander of the US Army Combined Arms Center at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.
60	AFP_ENG_20070104.0548.LDC2009T13	From June 2004 to September 2005 he was in charge of training the new Iraqi Army and security forces, an initiative which Bush has identified as a priority if the United States is going to reduce its troop strength in Iraq.
61	AFP_ENG_20070104.0548.LDC2009T13	Petraeus commanded the 101st Airborne Division during the 2003 invasion of Iraq and was widely praised for his subsequent work administering the northern city of Mosul.

63	AFP_ENG_20070109.0087.LDC2009T13	A Brazilian judge on Tuesday revoked a ban on Brazilians' access to the video website YouTube but also recommended that a video of supermodel Daniela Cicarelli apparently having sex at a Spanish beach continue to be blocked.
64	AFP_ENG_20070109.0087.LDC2009T13	Judge Enio Santarelli Zuliana said in a statement that access to YouTube was freed up days after a court order to block the website in Brazil following Cicarelli's suit over the video.
65	AFP_ENG_20070109.0087.LDC2009T13	The video clip shows Cicarelli, the ex-wife of Brazilian soccer star Ronaldo, and boyfriend Renato Malzoni in a passionate sequence on the beach at Cadiz and in the water.
66	AFP_ENG_20070109.0087.LDC2009T13	The two were filmed surreptitiously by a paparazzi and the video was posted on YouTube and other websites.
67	AFP_ENG_20070109.0087.LDC2009T13	The US-based video-sharing website has since removed the video from its website.

69	AFP_ENG_20070116.0198.LDC2009T13	Britain's finance minister Gordon Brown was set to leave for India Tuesday for a three-day tour that will be watched closely at home as he edges towards becoming the country's next prime minister.
70	AFP_ENG_20070116.0198.LDC2009T13	The chancellor of the exchequer and his ally, Trade and Industry Secretary Alistair Darling, were to depart for the sub-continent Tuesday lunchtime (1300-1400 GMT) with senior British political reporters in tow.
71	AFP_ENG_20070116.0198.LDC2009T13	Although the trip is mainly focused on strengthening bilateral trade links, analysts see Brown's visit as key to preparing the ground for and gaining experience before his expected promotion to the top job later this year.
72	AFP_ENG_20070116.0198.LDC2009T13	Brown -- best known for his careful stewardship of the British economy -- is widely seen as the man most likely to take over when Prime Minister Tony Blair leaves office within the next nine months.
73	AFP_ENG_20070116.0198.LDC2009T13	In recent weeks, he has strayed beyond his Treasury department brief in a series of high-profile appearances and speeches, to demonstrate his grip on wider policy issues and win over public opinion.
74	AFP_ENG_20070116.0198.LDC2009T13	They have ranged from domestic issues like education and health to foreign policy, in particular Britain's controversial presence in Iraq, to give a flavour of his future premiership.
75	AFP_ENG_20070116.0198.LDC2009T13	Brown and Darling -- who is himself being tipped to take over the post of finance minister -- are being accompanied to Mumbai, Delhi and Bangalore by more than 150 business leaders from more than 80 British companies.

77	AFP_ENG_20070118.0061.LDC2009T13	Israel's foreign minister said Thursday the country was strong enough to withstand the resignation of its military chief who quit over failures in the Lebanon war.
78	AFP_ENG_20070118.0061.LDC2009T13	"Israel is strong enough to face these challenges.
79	AFP_ENG_20070118.0061.LDC2009T13	The prime minister was elected in a democratic election," Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni told reporters on a visit to Tokyo.
80	AFP_ENG_20070118.0061.LDC2009T13	She said she had "high respect" for Lieutenant General Dan Halutz and stressed that Israel had a separation of powers.
81	AFP_ENG_20070118.0061.LDC2009T13	"I think in his resignation he expressed his values as an officer in the Israeli army.
82	AFP_ENG_20070118.0061.LDC2009T13	And this is part of the values that we are trying also to teach to our young soldiers," Livni said.
83	AFP_ENG_20070118.0061.LDC2009T13	Halutz resigned Wednesday over this summer's war in Lebanon, which came under fire in Israel for not meeting its objectives of freeing captive Israeli soldiers and stopping Hezbollah from attacking the Jewish state.
84	AFP_ENG_20070118.0061.LDC2009T13	The conflict killed more than 160 Israelis, mostly soldiers, and more than 1,200 Lebanese, mostly civilians.
85	AFP_ENG_20070118.0061.LDC2009T13	Hezbollah, a Shiite Muslim militia backed by Iran and Syria, celebrated his resignation by setting off fireworks in Beirut.

89	AFP_ENG_20070122.0520.LDC2009T13	Sharon Stone and "Basic Instinct 2" were top of the flops here Monday as organisers of Hollywood's annual Oscars parody -- the Razzies -- unveiled their nominations for 2006's "worst of the worst".
90	AFP_ENG_20070122.0520.LDC2009T13	The critically panned sequel to the 1992 psychological murder mystery received seven Razzie nods, which come one day before the official Oscars nominations are announced in Beverly Hills on Tuesday.
91	AFP_ENG_20070122.0520.LDC2009T13	"Unenjoyable, unerotic, unwatchable," was how one reviewer summed up Basic Instinct 2 last year, while another stuck the boot into screen goddess Stone, opining that there "are inflatable toys that are livelier."
92	AFP_ENG_20070122.0520.LDC2009T13	"Basic Instinct 2" received nominations for worst picture, actress, supporting actor, director, sequel, screenplay and screen couple.
93	AFP_ENG_20070122.0520.LDC2009T13	The only consolation that Stone and the movie's creators could take from Monday's announcements was that they had a rival for worst film of the year in the shape of "Little Man" by Wayans brothers Keenen Ivory, Shawn and Marlon.
94	AFP_ENG_20070122.0520.LDC2009T13	The slapstick comedy was derided by one reviewer as being "one- joke short of a one-joke movie", was described by the Golden Raspberry Award Foundation as being a "blatant knock-off of a 1954 Bugs Bunny cartoon".
95	AFP_ENG_20070122.0520.LDC2009T13	"Little Man" joined "Basic Instinct 2" at the head of the roll of dis-honor with seven nominations -- worst picture, actor (2), remake/rip-off, director, screenplay and screen couple.
96	AFP_ENG_20070122.0520.LDC2009T13	Other movies vying for the worst picture accolade that no-one wants to win are M. Night Shyamalan's "Lady in the Water", the remake of Australian thriller "Wicker Man" starring Nicolas Cage and Uwe Boll's "Bloodrayne".
97	AFP_ENG_20070122.0520.LDC2009T13	Internet users consider Boll "the worst director alive today", the Razzies organisers noted in a press release.
98	AFP_ENG_20070122.0520.LDC2009T13	Cage will be among the nominees for worst actor of 2006, which also include last year's winner Rob Schneider for "Benchwarmers" and TV funnyman Tim Allen for a trio of "terrible" films: "Santa Clause 3", "Shaggy Dog" and "Zoom."
99	AFP_ENG_20070122.0520.LDC2009T13	In the worst actress category, Stone faces competition from two of Hollywood's rising starlets, Jessica Simpson and Lindsay Lohan.
100	AFP_ENG_20070122.0520.LDC2009T13	Simpson has been nominated for "Employee of the Month", while Lohan, who last week entered a rehabilitation centre, received a nod for "Just My Luck", dismissed by prominent critic Richard Roeper as "a real piece of junk".
101	AFP_ENG_20070122.0520.LDC2009T13	Several other well-known names were amongst the nominees for worst supporting actor and actress.
102	AFP_ENG_20070122.0520.LDC2009T13	Oscar-winner Ben Kingsley and Danny DeVito are on the shortlist for worst supporting actor.
103	AFP_ENG_20070122.0520.LDC2009T13	Nominees for worst supporting actress include perennial Razzies candidates Jenny McCarthy and Carmen Electra, along with "Lost" star Michelle Rodriguez and Kate Bosworth for an "ultra-lame" portrayl of Lois Lane in "Superman Returns", Razzies organisers said.
104	AFP_ENG_20070122.0520.LDC2009T13	The winners of the un-coveted Razzies, which were created in 1980, will be announced at an awards ceremony in Hollywood on February 24, a day ahead of the Academy Awards.
105	AFP_ENG_20070122.0520.LDC2009T13	Recipients of the Razzies rarely show up to collect their prizes, gold spray- painted plastic gongs in the shape of a raspberry, which organisers say are worth as much as 4.97 dollars.

107	AFP_ENG_20070123.0201.LDC2009T13	Taiwan's pointman on mainland China warned Tuesday the United States to keep an eye on Beijing, saying the North Korean nuclear crisis was letting it escape international scrutiny.
108	AFP_ENG_20070123.0201.LDC2009T13	"The United States will continue to pay attention to the Korean peninsula, and that will be an opportunity for China to expand its influence," Joseph Wu, chairman of Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council, said on a visit to Tokyo.
109	AFP_ENG_20070123.0201.LDC2009T13	"And China can do something against Taiwan to escape the international scrutiny, especially the American scrutiny," he told reporters.
110	AFP_ENG_20070123.0201.LDC2009T13	China is the main ally of North Korea, which tested an atom bomb in October, and is the host of six-nation disarmament talks involving the United States that are expected to resume in the coming weeks.
111	AFP_ENG_20070123.0201.LDC2009T13	China regards Taiwan, where defeated nationalists fled from the communists in 1949, as a province awaiting reunification, by force if necessary.
112	AFP_ENG_20070123.0201.LDC2009T13	But Taiwan has faced diplomatic setbacks, with seven nations switching diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing since independence-leaning President Chen Shui-bian took office in 2000.
113	AFP_ENG_20070123.0201.LDC2009T13	"The international community has been relatively quiet" on China's diplomacy to secure diplomatic recognition, Wu said.
114	AFP_ENG_20070123.0201.LDC2009T13	"China can try to expand its influence in Africa, in Latin America, in the South Pacific, without the international attention because the international attention is on the Korean Peninsula," Wu said.
115	AFP_ENG_20070123.0201.LDC2009T13	The South Pacific, Africa and Latin America are the main diplomatic battlegrounds for the two rivals, which accuse each other of trying to lure away each other's allies with aid.
116	AFP_ENG_20070123.0201.LDC2009T13	But Wu said relations between Japan and Taiwan are "getting better and better," pointing to Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's recent trip to Europe where he opposed the lifting of the EU arms embargo on China.
117	AFP_ENG_20070123.0201.LDC2009T13	Wu pays annual visits to Japan, Taiwan's former colonial ruler.

123	AFP_ENG_20070129.0087.LDC2009T13	Police had earlier said that the blast, which ripped through a bakery in a small shopping centre in Eilat, had been an accident.

131	AFP_ENG_20070130.0291.LDC2009T13	Thousands of Greek schoolchildren demonstrated Tuesday at the Acropolis to demand that foreign museums return "pillaged" fragments of the Parthenon, the 2,500-year-old temple to the Greek capital's patron goddess Athena.
132	AFP_ENG_20070130.0291.LDC2009T13	Clad in orange jackets stamped with the logo "Reunification Now", the pupils formed a human chain along one of Athens' main tourist walkways in a protest mainly aimed at the British Museum in London.

134	AFP_ENG_20070130.0291.LDC2009T13	"The symbol of our democracy and our culture (has lain) brutally mutilated and pillaged for two centuries," they said.
135	AFP_ENG_20070130.0291.LDC2009T13	Fragments of the Parthenon, including sculpted friezes depicting gods, men and monsters, were removed from the temple in the early 19th century at a time when modern-day Greece was part of the Ottoman Empire.

138	AFP_ENG_20070130.0291.LDC2009T13	The Greeks have for 20 years demanded the fragments' return, complaining that the works -- masterpieces executed at the height of the Greek classical period -- were illegally removed and are part of the national heritage.

163	AFP_ENG_20070214.0085.LDC2009T13	US defence officials claimed Wednesday that their Iraqi nemesis radical Shiite cleric Moqtada la-Sadr has fled for Iran ahead of a planned military crackdown on sectarian violence.
164	AFP_ENG_20070214.0085.LDC2009T13	The anti-American firebrand's supporters dismissed the allegations by anonymous military officials, insisting that Sadr supports the joint US-Iraq Baghdad security plan and that they will disarm their militia once order is restored.
165	AFP_ENG_20070214.0085.LDC2009T13	"We have seen the reports and believe them to be accurate," a US defence official told AFP in Baghdad, referring to reports in the US media that Sadr had been driven overland to Tehran two or three weeks ago.
166	AFP_ENG_20070214.0085.LDC2009T13	He has not been seen publicly in Iraq in that period, but Nassar al-Rubaie, the head of Sadr's parliamentary bloc, insisted that the cleric was "still inside Iraq and working normally" and had no fear of US forces.
167	AFP_ENG_20070214.0085.LDC2009T13	Bassem al-Aathari, an official at Sadr's office in Najaf south of Baghdad, said the cleric is still in the Shiite holy city and that if he were to travel abroad this would be announced as had been the case for previous trips.
168	AFP_ENG_20070214.0085.LDC2009T13	"It's ridiculous.
169	AFP_ENG_20070214.0085.LDC2009T13	It's nothing," Rubaie told AFP in Baghdad.
170	AFP_ENG_20070214.0085.LDC2009T13	"If the US army already in Iraq is incapable of resisting Sadr, what difference would 20,000 reinforcements make?"
171	AFP_ENG_20070214.0085.LDC2009T13	The Pentagon describes Sadr's Mahdi Army militia as the most dangerous single faction in the vicious sectarian war gripping Iraq, accusing rogue elements of the force of killing hundreds of Sunni civilians.
172	AFP_ENG_20070214.0085.LDC2009T13	The United States is in the process of sending five extra combat brigades to support a joint US-Iraqi operation to pacify Baghdad, which is in the grip of a bloody war between Shiite and Sunni factions.
173	AFP_ENG_20070214.0085.LDC2009T13	Rubaie repeated the Sadr movement's insistence that it supports the security plan and that its fighters would disarm once the plan is successful.
174	AFP_ENG_20070214.0085.LDC2009T13	"The arms that people got to defend themselves will disappear as soon as the state assures security.
175	AFP_ENG_20070214.0085.LDC2009T13	We support this plan," he said.
176	AFP_ENG_20070214.0085.LDC2009T13	Iraq announced Tuesday it will close its borders with Iran and Syria and impose draconian emergency-style security measures on Baghdad, although the commander of the operation said the decree would come into effect "later".

179	AFP_ENG_20070214.0085.LDC2009T13	In addition, weapons permits will be suspended for everyone in Baghdad apart from the Iraqi and US-led security forces and registered private security firms and the city's nightly curfew will be reinforced.
180	AFP_ENG_20070214.0085.LDC2009T13	Gambar will combine under his command police and military forces, and be empowered to crack down on rogue security force units within the capital.
181	AFP_ENG_20070214.0085.LDC2009T13	The decree will authorise him to "impose necessary restrictions in all public places and centres and clubs and organisations and unions and businesses and institutions and offices to protect citizens and people who work.
182	AFP_ENG_20070214.0085.LDC2009T13	"Searches will be done on public streets and precautionary measures will be applied on packages, mail, messages and communications and telecommunications equipment," he said, reading the decree on state television.

189	AFP_ENG_20070215.0119.LDC2009T13	Nature China (www.naturechina.com) will also include research from Hong Kong.
190	AFP_ENG_20070215.0119.LDC2009T13	"In the past decade, the output of research papers from China in the Thomson ISI database has soared from 10,000 a year to over 80,000," Nature Publishing Group (NPG) said in a press release.
191	AFP_ENG_20070215.0119.LDC2009T13	Thomson ISI, also called Thomson Scientific, is a portal of scientific studies.
192	AFP_ENG_20070215.0119.LDC2009T13	In terms of numbers, the output of Chinese papers is now equal to that of Britain and Japan, NPG said.
193	AFP_ENG_20070215.0119.LDC2009T13	In terms of quantity -- as measured by the number of citations in other papers -- the number of high-impact papers from China has increased tenfold, to several hundred a year, it said.
194	AFP_ENG_20070215.0119.LDC2009T13	The website is being sponsored by a major pharmaceutical group.
195	AFP_ENG_20070215.0119.LDC2009T13	In January 2006, a report by the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) said China was leading the charge by emerging Asian countries to challenge the supremacy of the United States, Europe and Japan in research and development.

200	AFP_ENG_20070219.0385.LDC2009T13	Authorities in Lagos, Nigeria's sprawling economic capital, on Monday launched a new bus scheme aimed at easing the traffic jams for which the city is notorious, officials said.
201	AFP_ENG_20070219.0385.LDC2009T13	Two hundred and eighty luxury red-painted buses were on Monday deployed to some selected major Lagos routes under the Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) system.
202	AFP_ENG_20070219.0385.LDC2009T13	Special lanes are set aside for the government-owned red-painted BRT buses and trespassers on them are liable to a fine of 50,000 naira (385 dollars / 308 euros), a senior official of the Lagos transport ministry, Rotimi Oyekan, said.
203	AFP_ENG_20070219.0385.LDC2009T13	Lagos has no urban railway, tube or tram service.
204	AFP_ENG_20070219.0385.LDC2009T13	Commuters travel by private car, privately owned lorry-buses, minibuses or motorbike taxis.
205	AFP_ENG_20070219.0385.LDC2009T13	The result is the "go-slows" for which the city is notorious and which are often exacerbated by fuel shortages and huge queues in front of filling stations.
206	AFP_ENG_20070219.0385.LDC2009T13	Commuters regularly complain of taking three hours to cover 40 kilometres (25 miles) in the city.
207	AFP_ENG_20070219.0385.LDC2009T13	Oyekan said that the efficient operation of BRT buses would decongest the roads as many workers and traders would leave their cars and patronise the red buses because of their safety, low tariff and ability to get to destinations fast.
208	AFP_ENG_20070219.0385.LDC2009T13	The BRT bus drivers have been specially trained to maintain a special speed limit, to be courteous to commuters while the vehicles are fitted with communications gadgets, he said in a radio interview.
209	AFP_ENG_20070219.0385.LDC2009T13	A further 300 buses are expected to be added to the fleet before the end of March, officials said.
210	AFP_ENG_20070219.0385.LDC2009T13	Observers said that with the introduction of BRT buses, government's intention was to gradually phase out "molue", the ill-maintained privately- owned yellow lorry buses, often prone to accidents.
211	AFP_ENG_20070219.0385.LDC2009T13	More than half of all vehicles in Nigeria are found in Lagos, where officials say illiteracy, selfishness and road indiscipline are responsible for gargantuan traffic jams and frequent crashes.
212	AFP_ENG_20070219.0385.LDC2009T13	The city's population is just over nine million according to federal government figures, but local state government estimates put it at closer to 17 million, a figure more in line with UN estimates.

214	AFP_ENG_20070219.0554.LDC2009T13	One of southern India's biggest brands, MTR Foods, is being swallowed up by a foreign owner to the dismay of local consumers, who fear for their famed ready- to-eat vegetarian meals, pickles and poppadums.
215	AFP_ENG_20070219.0554.LDC2009T13	Sadanand Maiya, the founder of MTR Foods, and his associates last week agreed to sell their combined 59 percent stake in the Bangalore-based company to Norwegian consumer products maker Orkla, which also bought out other, minority, shareholders.
216	AFP_ENG_20070219.0554.LDC2009T13	MTR Foods is an offshoot of Mavalli Tiffin Rooms, a restaurant on Bangalore's Lalbagh road founded in 1924 by Maiya's family to serve vegetarian south Indian Brahmin cuisine.
217	AFP_ENG_20070219.0554.LDC2009T13	The spartan two-storey restaurant is a tourist attraction and an institution in Bangalore, India's Silicon Valley, where patrons wait patiently for hours for their turn to eat its wholesome multi-course vegetarian meals.
218	AFP_ENG_20070219.0554.LDC2009T13	"Every Bangalorean is proud of MTR," said R. C. Purohit, president of the Federation of Karnataka Chambers of Commerce and Industry.
219	AFP_ENG_20070219.0554.LDC2009T13	"We take every visiting relative and friend there for a meal, despite the queue."
220	AFP_ENG_20070219.0554.LDC2009T13	MTR Foods has "created value that's commendable," Purohit said.
221	AFP_ENG_20070219.0554.LDC2009T13	The restaurant is not part of the Maiya group's sale, which was confirmed by Orkla on its website, www.orkla.com.
222	AFP_ENG_20070219.0554.LDC2009T13	The February 13 sale is still pending Indian regulatory approval, but consumers are already pining and wondering whether MTR's packaged foods will taste the same again.
223	AFP_ENG_20070219.0554.LDC2009T13	"Sob Sob," a reader who identified herself as Mytri commented on the blogsite Metroblogging Bangalore.
224	AFP_ENG_20070219.0554.LDC2009T13	"I hope they continue all the products and the quality."
225	AFP_ENG_20070219.0554.LDC2009T13	"Will Orkla continue the success of MTR?"
226	AFP_ENG_20070219.0554.LDC2009T13	asked Naren, another reader.
227	AFP_ENG_20070219.0554.LDC2009T13	"Will Orkla succeed in providing quality taste?"
228	AFP_ENG_20070219.0554.LDC2009T13	A third consumer fondly recalled that MTR's heat-and-eat vegetarian Indian meals had proved to be a godsend during frequent travels in the Far East.
229	AFP_ENG_20070219.0554.LDC2009T13	And an Indian contributor from Oslo, wondered whether he would now be able to buy MTR's ready-to-eat bisibele baath, a popular rice-lentil-vegetable preparation, in the Norwegian capital.
230	AFP_ENG_20070219.0554.LDC2009T13	Orkla paid the equivalent of between 80 million and 100 million dollars to buy the Indian company, according to local media, as it enters the Asian market for the first time.
231	AFP_ENG_20070219.0554.LDC2009T13	"As a result of this acquisition we will be able to assess the Indian market as a possible future growth platform for Orkla's branded consumer goods business at close quarters," Executive Vice President Torkild Nordberg said in a statement on Orkla's website.
232	AFP_ENG_20070219.0554.LDC2009T13	Maiya was not available for comment.
233	AFP_ENG_20070219.0554.LDC2009T13	An MTR spokesman said Thursday the company had sworn to remain silent for some time following the transaction, adding Maiya might comment on the transaction after about two weeks.
234	AFP_ENG_20070219.0554.LDC2009T13	MTR Foods was born in the 1970s, when the government imposed food price controls specifying what restaurants should charge for what they served.
235	AFP_ENG_20070219.0554.LDC2009T13	Mavalli Tiffin Rooms closed shop temporarily, saying it could not maintain its quality if it served patrons at those prices, and refusing to compromise.
236	AFP_ENG_20070219.0554.LDC2009T13	Maiya, an electrical engineer, then launched MTR Foods, using the restaurant's former employees.
237	AFP_ENG_20070219.0554.LDC2009T13	The company's first success was a packaged mix for a breakfast pancake called the rava idli and it graduated rapidly to other vegetarian snack foods and chips, spices, pre-cooked meals and ice creams.
238	AFP_ENG_20070219.0554.LDC2009T13	Helping its rise was the restaurant's reputation for quality and hygiene, although MTR Foods remained a separate entity from Mavalli Tiffin Rooms.
239	AFP_ENG_20070219.0554.LDC2009T13	The agreement to sell MTR Foods follows the sale last year of supermarket chain Niligiri's, another Bangalorean institution, to a private equity investor.
240	AFP_ENG_20070219.0554.LDC2009T13	Customers still berate the founders, the Mudaliar family, for selling out, a member of the family said in published remarks.
241	AFP_ENG_20070219.0554.LDC2009T13	Other Indian brands have also been sold.
242	AFP_ENG_20070219.0554.LDC2009T13	In the 1990s, in the early days of Indian economic liberalisation, tycoon Ramesh Chauhan sold his Thums Up and Limca brands of soft drink to Coca-Cola.
243	AFP_ENG_20070219.0554.LDC2009T13	Critics cried "sellout" and saw the sale as a sign that Indian brands were set for an early demise, although both Thums Up and Limca are still sold and boast sizeable customer loyalty.
244	AFP_ENG_20070219.0554.LDC2009T13	This time, barring the emotional twinge felt by long-time consumers, there has been no criticism so far, only acceptance -- perhaps a reflection of how far India has come along the road of market reform.

249	AFP_ENG_20070219.0565.LDC2009T13	A campaign to improve the manners of Beijing's queue-jumping residents ahead of the Olympics is showing results although a gold-medal standard is still a long way off, state press reported Tuesday.
250	AFP_ENG_20070219.0565.LDC2009T13	Incidents of littering, spitting, flaunting traffic rules and pushing ahead in queues have all started to decline since 2005, the Xinhua news agency said, citing an extensive study by the the People's University of China.
251	AFP_ENG_20070219.0565.LDC2009T13	A "civic index" -- measuring compliance with health and social rules, attitudes towards strangers, etiquette in watching sports events and willingness to contribute to the Olympics -- is improving, the study said.
252	AFP_ENG_20070219.0565.LDC2009T13	The index stood at 69.06 last year, up 3.85 points from 2005 but still well done on the goal set of 72-78 for August 2008, when the world will focus on Beijing for the Olympic Games.
253	AFP_ENG_20070219.0565.LDC2009T13	"The government and citizens still have a lot of things to do to improve their public behaviour," Xinhua quoted Sha Lianxiang, a sociology professor with the university and an author of the study, as saying.
254	AFP_ENG_20070219.0565.LDC2009T13	As part of government efforts to improve manners, 4.3 million households have received pamphlets outlining social misdemeanours such as spitting and littering.
255	AFP_ENG_20070219.0565.LDC2009T13	The government has also this month held the first of its designated anti-queue jumping days.
256	AFP_ENG_20070219.0565.LDC2009T13	On the 11th day of each month, residents will now be expected to pay special attention to not pushing in line.
257	AFP_ENG_20070219.0565.LDC2009T13	"Line up politely -- welcome the Olympics in an orderly and civilised manner," read a banner adorning a bus stop on February 11, the first official day of the programme.
258	AFP_ENG_20070219.0565.LDC2009T13	Last year the city government also launched a "smile" campaign.

260	AFP_ENG_20070220.0328.LDC2009T13	EU environment ministers agreed on Tuesday to plans for deep cuts in greenhouse gases of as much as 30 percent, the European Commission said.
261	AFP_ENG_20070220.0328.LDC2009T13	The ministers, meeting in Brussels, agreed to set a target to slash carbon dioxide emissions by "at least" 20 percent by 2020 and possibly as much as 30 percent, the latter on condition that other developed countries are willing to do the same.
262	AFP_ENG_20070220.0328.LDC2009T13	The commitment would be the main plank of the European Union's strategy for combatting climate change after 2012, when existing emissions targets under the Kyoto Protocol expire.
263	AFP_ENG_20070220.0328.LDC2009T13	Under the Kyoto Protocol, developed countries are currently supposed to reduce their emissions by five percent by 2012 from 1990 levels, while the EU has a higher target of eight percent.

265	AFP_ENG_20070222.0272.LDC2009T13	South Korea's unpopular President Roh Moo-Hyun cut ties with the ruling Uri Party on Thursday and the premier offered to quit, officials said, in changes thought linked to December's presidential poll.
266	AFP_ENG_20070222.0272.LDC2009T13	Roh announced his departure during a dinner with Uri party leaders, presidential spokesman Yoon Seung-Yong told reporters.
267	AFP_ENG_20070222.0272.LDC2009T13	It leaves him as a political neutral for his last year in office.
268	AFP_ENG_20070222.0272.LDC2009T13	"I have hesitated about leaving the party amid heated debate about it.
269	AFP_ENG_20070222.0272.LDC2009T13	But I decided to leave in order to help eliminate intra-party conflict," Roh was quoted as saying.
270	AFP_ENG_20070222.0272.LDC2009T13	Prime Minister Han Myeong-sook offered to resign at the same dinner, the Yonhap news agency reported.
271	AFP_ENG_20070222.0272.LDC2009T13	The 62-year-old, South Korea's first female prime minister, intends to run for president and is set to represent left-leaning Uri and its allies, Yonhap had reported earlier.
272	AFP_ENG_20070222.0272.LDC2009T13	Roh has repeatedly said he might quit Uri, apparently to push through constitutional reforms and allow it to rebuild support ahead of the presidential poll.
273	AFP_ENG_20070222.0272.LDC2009T13	Roh wants to shift from the current five-year, single-term presidency to a four- year, two-term system to promote political stability, even though he himself cannot benefit.
274	AFP_ENG_20070222.0272.LDC2009T13	The president's support ratings are currently at around 20 percent, although they have improved since plunging to nearly 10 percent late last year.
275	AFP_ENG_20070222.0272.LDC2009T13	Some critics say Roh's low ratings are cutting support for his party, which has an approval rating of little more than 10 percent compared to some 50 percent for the conservative opposition Grand National Party.
276	AFP_ENG_20070222.0272.LDC2009T13	The opposition said the president's departure was designed to deflect criticism of his administration's perceived failure to combat an economic slowdown and high unemployment.

286	AFP_ENG_20070223.0066.LDC2009T13	Japanese police said Friday they had arrested three employees of Yamaha Motor Co. for allegedly attempting to export to China a helicopter with potential military uses.
287	AFP_ENG_20070223.0066.LDC2009T13	The three employees, who include Kazuo Uchiyama, senior general manager of aeronautic operations, are suspected of attempting to export an unmanned helicopter to a Chinese aerial photography company in December 2005 without approval from the trade ministry, a police spokesman said.

295	AFP_ENG_20070225.0398.LDC2009T13	Saudis considering plans to boost local employment: report
296	AFP_ENG_20070225.0398.LDC2009T13	Saudi officials are considering plans to raise the cost of hiring foreign workers for the private sector in an effort to boost employment levels, the country's deputy labour minister told the Financial Times in an interview published Monday.
297	AFP_ENG_20070225.0398.LDC2009T13	"It is an economic problem and it needs an economic solution," Abdulwahed al- Humaid told the business daily.
298	AFP_ENG_20070225.0398.LDC2009T13	According to Humaid, the solution is "to increase the cost of expatriate labour to make it comparable to the cost of the Saudi worker."
299	AFP_ENG_20070225.0398.LDC2009T13	Despite rising oil prices in recent years, Saudi unemployment has risen from 9.7 percent to 12 percent since 2002, the FT said, and there are 6.5 million foreign workers in the Middle Eastern kingdom -- migrant workers willing to accept lower pay than young Saudis.
300	AFP_ENG_20070225.0398.LDC2009T13	In the long-term, the government's objective is to foster an economic environment where the "Saudi worker becomes productive so the economy becomes more competitive internationally," Humaid said.
301	AFP_ENG_20070225.0398.LDC2009T13	Saudi Arabia already requires industries to employ a quota of locals, and has increased the number of scholarships for Saudis to study overseas, and is improving the public education system.
302	AFP_ENG_20070225.0398.LDC2009T13	Humaid said he accepted that the reforms would be unpopular in the private sector, commenting: "What we tell the private sector (is): Saudis are not as bad as you try to portray them when you provide them with a good working environment."

304	AFP_ENG_20070227.0648.LDC2009T13	Nicklas Bendtner shot Birmingham back to the top of the Championship as his first half goal secured a 1-0 win against Leeds on Tuesday.
305	AFP_ENG_20070227.0648.LDC2009T13	On-loan Arsenal striker Bendtner struck early on at St Andrews and Steve Bruce's side held onto their lead to move a point clear of West Bromwich Albion at the top of the table.
306	AFP_ENG_20070227.0648.LDC2009T13	Birmingham had led the league for several weeks earlier in the season before slipping in recent weeks, but they were too strong for struggling Leeds.
307	AFP_ENG_20070227.0648.LDC2009T13	The Blues came close to breaking the deadlock when Gary McSheffrey drove in a 25-yard free-kick that was just scrambled off the line by David Healy.
308	AFP_ENG_20070227.0648.LDC2009T13	Leeds' reprieve was short-lived however as McSheffrey whipped in the resulting 15th minute corner and Bendtner headed home for his 10th goal of the season.
309	AFP_ENG_20070227.0648.LDC2009T13	Dennis Wise's team were close to equalising just before the break when Birmingham keeper Colin Doyle got a touch on Richard Cresswell's shot to divert the ball onto a post before Martin Taylor hacked off the line.
310	AFP_ENG_20070227.0648.LDC2009T13	That was as close as Leeds came and the Elland Road outfit are now without a win in four matches and firmly rooted to the bottom of the table.
311	AFP_ENG_20070227.0648.LDC2009T13	Norwich midfielder Simon Lappin hit a superb stoppage time winner as his side came from behind to claim a 3-2 victory at Luton.
312	AFP_ENG_20070227.0648.LDC2009T13	The kick-off at Kenilworth Road had been delayed by 15 minutes because of power problems which prevented fans from entering the stadium.
313	AFP_ENG_20070227.0648.LDC2009T13	But Luton started well and took the lead in the 11th minute when Bjorn Runstrom, on loan from Fulham, converted David Bell's cross.
314	AFP_ENG_20070227.0648.LDC2009T13	Norwich were level in the 26th minute as Chris Martin drove in a perfectly- placed shot from an acute angle just inside the penalty area.
315	AFP_ENG_20070227.0648.LDC2009T13	Bell set up Luton's second in the 48th minute as he skipped around Norwich keeper Paul Gallacher and crossed to Drew Talbot, who looped a header into the empty net.
316	AFP_ENG_20070227.0648.LDC2009T13	But Peter Grant's side refused to accept defeat and Jason Shackell equalised in the 73rd minute with near-post header from Youssef Safri's free-kick.
317	AFP_ENG_20070227.0648.LDC2009T13	Just when it looked as though both teams had settled for a point, Lappin won it when he bent a free-kick past Marlon Beresford from the edge of the area for his first ever Norwich goal.
318	AFP_ENG_20070306.0516.LDC2009T13	Britain takes centre stage at Beethovenfest in Bonn
319	AFP_ENG_20070306.0516.LDC2009T13	The Beethovenfest, Bonn's annual tribute to its most famous son, will this year focus on the composer's links with Britain, the organisers announced on Tuesday.
320	AFP_ENG_20070306.0516.LDC2009T13	Under the motto "Joy -- Beethoven and the British cultural sphere", the annual month-long festival will showcase British artists, conductors and orchestras.
321	AFP_ENG_20070306.0516.LDC2009T13	It will trace the links between Ludwig van Beethoven (1770-1827), one of world's most popular and best-known composers, and the musical, cultural and political life of Britain at the time.
322	AFP_ENG_20070306.0516.LDC2009T13	It was the musical impresario and concert organiser Johann Peter Salomon (1745-1815) who first brought Beethoven's works to London in the early 1800s.
323	AFP_ENG_20070306.0516.LDC2009T13	He had already been responsible for establishing the fame of Austrian composer Franz Joseph Haydn (1732-1809) in Britain.
324	AFP_ENG_20070306.0516.LDC2009T13	One of Beethoven's friends and pupils, his former copyist and secretary Ferdinand Ries (1784-1838), commissioned a number of works from the composer when he became director of London's Philharmonic Society in 1813.
325	AFP_ENG_20070306.0516.LDC2009T13	One of those commissions eventually became Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, nowadays known as the Choral Symphony (1824).
326	AFP_ENG_20070306.0516.LDC2009T13	And it is the finale of that symphony, based on Schiller's "Ode an die Freude" (Ode to Joy), that provides the motto for this year's festival.
327	AFP_ENG_20070306.0516.LDC2009T13	Beethoven also wrote a patriotic symphonic work, "Wellingtons Sieg oder die Schlacht bei Vittoria", celebrating the Duke of Wellington's victory over the French at the Battle of Vitoria in Spain in 1821.
328	AFP_ENG_20070306.0516.LDC2009T13	The work makes use of the anthems "Rule Britannia" and "God Save the King".
329	AFP_ENG_20070306.0516.LDC2009T13	Works by British composers will feature highly on the programme of this year's festival.
330	AFP_ENG_20070306.0516.LDC2009T13	As well as musical giants such as Henry Purcell, Edward Elgar and Benjamin Britten, there will also be works by contemporary composers Thomas Ades, Harrison Birtwistle, Brian Ferneyhough and Jonathan Harvey.
331	AFP_ENG_20070306.0516.LDC2009T13	The official opening gala concert will be a performance of Elgar's Serenade for Strings and his Enigma Variations, as well as Beethoven's violin concerto, by the Philharmonia Orchestra under British conductor, Sir Andrew Davis.
332	AFP_ENG_20070306.0516.LDC2009T13	Other British ensembles performing some of the 61 concerts between August 24 and September 23 include the BBC Symphony Orchestra, the Choir of King's College, Cambridge, the Academy of St. Martin's in the Field and the Hilliard Ensemble.
333	AFP_ENG_20070306.0516.LDC2009T13	And perhaps one of the main highlights of the festival will be a performance of Britten's War Requiem in Bonn's "Beethovenhalle" concert hall on September 12.
334	AFP_ENG_20070306.0516.LDC2009T13	The Beethovenfest dates back to 1845 when the Beethoven Monument on Bonn's Muensterplatz was unveiled and a three-day music festival was held in honour of the composer's 75th birthday.
335	AFP_ENG_20070306.0516.LDC2009T13	Among the guests were some of the leading composers of the age, including Hector Berlioz, Louis Spohr and Franz Liszt.
336	AFP_ENG_20070306.0516.LDC2009T13	The modern version of the festival was initiated in 1931 and held every two to three years.
337	AFP_ENG_20070306.0516.LDC2009T13	Since 1999, the festival has been an annual event.
338	AFP_ENG_20070306.0516.LDC2009T13	In previous years, the festival has focussed on Beethoven's influence on the music and culture of countries such as France and Russia.

340	AFP_ENG_20070307.0556.LDC2009T13	British lawmakers voted Wednesday to reform the upper chamber of parliament, the House of Lords, to make it fully elected for the first time in its 600-year existence.
341	AFP_ENG_20070307.0556.LDC2009T13	Members of the lower House of Commons voted by a margin of 113 votes for what would constitute a complete overhaul of the House of Lords and pave the way for one of Britain's most radical constitutional changes.
342	AFP_ENG_20070307.0556.LDC2009T13	The vote, which passed 337 to 224, will not pass into law, but the result is expected to inform government thinking when it draws up legislation for reform later this year.
343	AFP_ENG_20070307.0556.LDC2009T13	MPs also voted by a majority of 280 to remove the remaining hereditary peers from the House of Lords.
344	AFP_ENG_20070307.0556.LDC2009T13	Hereditary peers survived Blair's first attempt to reform the chamber in 1999.
345	AFP_ENG_20070307.0556.LDC2009T13	Commons leader Jack Straw presented MPs with a total of nine options by the government, all of which they could back or reject.
346	AFP_ENG_20070307.0556.LDC2009T13	Among the options rejected were abolishing the second chamber altogether
347	AFP_ENG_20070307.0556.LDC2009T13	a fully-appointed Lords
348	AFP_ENG_20070307.0556.LDC2009T13	and partially-elected options at 20, 40, 50 and 60 percent.
349	AFP_ENG_20070307.0556.LDC2009T13	They did back a proposal for an 80 percent elected House of Lords but by a margin of only 38 votes -- significantly smaller than the vote backing totally elected chamber.
350	AFP_ENG_20070307.0556.LDC2009T13	Prime Minister Tony Blair's government had favoured a 50 percent elected chamber.
351	AFP_ENG_20070307.0556.LDC2009T13	Blair himself voted in favour of a 50-50 split between elected and appointed peers (members of the House of Lords) but did not take part in the other votes, his office said.
352	AFP_ENG_20070307.0556.LDC2009T13	A previous vote on reforming the House of Lords in 2003 ended in stalemate after lawmakers rejected all the options on offer.
353	AFP_ENG_20070307.0556.LDC2009T13	Blair backed keeping a wholly- appointed second chamber.
354	AFP_ENG_20070307.0556.LDC2009T13	A police probe was launched last year into whether Blair's Labour and other parties illegally offered seats in the Lords in return for financial donations -- the "cash for honours" row which is plaguing his last weeks in power.
355	AFP_ENG_20070307.0556.LDC2009T13	Straw said Wednesday's vote was a "historic step forward on an issue which has been a matter of debate for decades" which could transform the Lords into a more dynamic and active law-making body.
356	AFP_ENG_20070307.0556.LDC2009T13	The Lords scrutinises and revises government legislation but is often seen by the public as an undemocratic "retirement home" for former MPs or a place for the privileged titled classes or political appointees.
357	AFP_ENG_20070307.0556.LDC2009T13	"The House of Commons has broken the deadlock.
358	AFP_ENG_20070307.0556.LDC2009T13	It is a dramatic result in the history of the British Parliament," Straw said.
359	AFP_ENG_20070307.0556.LDC2009T13	The Lords itself will vote on the issue next week, he added.
360	AFP_ENG_20070307.0556.LDC2009T13	The government will then consider its next move in discussion with all parties.
361	AFP_ENG_20070307.0556.LDC2009T13	But already opponents assessed that very little will happen.
362	AFP_ENG_20070307.0556.LDC2009T13	The former leader of the main opposition Conservative Party, Iain Duncan Smith, said the vote for a fully-elected chamber was a "brilliant parliamentary tactic" designed to muddy the waters on reform.
363	AFP_ENG_20070307.0556.LDC2009T13	The vote came amid claims from a Labour peer in the House of Lords, Lord David Lipsey, that making it an elected body could cost more than one billion pounds (1.5 billion euros, 1.9 billion dollars) per term.
364	AFP_ENG_20070307.0556.LDC2009T13	The former economics editor of the weekly Sunday Times newspaper said this "plausible" estimate, based on official figures, was a conservative one and could rise with inflation.

370	AFP_ENG_20070309.0270.LDC2009T13	Oscar-nominated actress Kate Winslet has donated libel damages she won over a magazine report saying she sought help for a weight problem to an eating disorder charity.
371	AFP_ENG_20070309.0270.LDC2009T13	The British star was not in London's High Court Friday, but her solicitor said the story published in February by the weekly glossy Grazia caused her personal hurt, distress, anger and embarrassment and damaged her reputation.
372	AFP_ENG_20070309.0270.LDC2009T13	"I am not a hypocrite.
373	AFP_ENG_20070309.0270.LDC2009T13	I have always been, and shall continue to be, honest when it comes to body/weight issues," she said in a statement.
374	AFP_ENG_20070309.0270.LDC2009T13	The star's lawyer said the article wrongly claimed she sought help with her weight from an LA doctor.
375	AFP_ENG_20070309.0270.LDC2009T13	She has previously gone on record as saying she would not bow to Hollywood pressure to be skinny.
376	AFP_ENG_20070309.0270.LDC2009T13	In Grazia's article, Dr Yi Pan discussed treatments he offered to Hollywood A-listers including Winslet at his Chinese Healing Institute in California.
377	AFP_ENG_20070309.0270.LDC2009T13	Winslet -- nominated for Best Actress at this year's Oscars -- immediately complained to publisher Emap London Lifestyle Ltd, saying the article suggested she had lied to the public.
378	AFP_ENG_20070309.0270.LDC2009T13	Atkins said Winslet did receive treatment from Dr. Pan for a neck injury, but did not seek any treatment for weight loss.
379	AFP_ENG_20070309.0270.LDC2009T13	Winslet said she was "delighted" the matter had been resolved.
380	AFP_ENG_20070309.0270.LDC2009T13	"Grazia magazine have apologised to me in full, and admitted that their story was incorrect, which gives me tremendous peace of mind.

384	AFP_ENG_20070313.0112.LDC2009T13	Major threat to Mugabe from within own party: analysts by Fanuel Jongwe
385	AFP_ENG_20070313.0112.LDC2009T13	The major threat to Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe comes from disgruntled members of his ZANU-PF party upset with his plans to extend his rule rather than the official opposition, according to analysts.
386	AFP_ENG_20070313.0112.LDC2009T13	Mugabe, the 83-year-old who has ruled Zimbabwe since independence in 1980 from Britain, has attracted widespread international criticism for ordering a brutal crackdown on the opposition.
387	AFP_ENG_20070313.0112.LDC2009T13	But while Morgan Tsvangirai, leader of the main opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), may be attracting the headlines after his arrest and alleged beating, a bigger danger to Mugabe's rule lurks closer to home.
388	AFP_ENG_20070313.0112.LDC2009T13	"Mugabe is facing greater opposition than at any other time within ZANU-PF," said Takavafira Zhou, a political analyst and history lecturer at Masvingo State University in southern Zimbabwe.
389	AFP_ENG_20070313.0112.LDC2009T13	Mugabe revealed in an interview over the weekend that he would like to stand for another six-year term of office in 2008 which would mean he would be aged 90 by its completion.
390	AFP_ENG_20070313.0112.LDC2009T13	His comments come as his Zimbabwe African National Union- Patriotic Front is considering an earlier call by Mugabe for the 2008 presidential polls to be held over until 2010, ostensibly to coincide with parliamentary elections.
391	AFP_ENG_20070313.0112.LDC2009T13	While the ZANU-PF annual conference in December did pass a number of resolutions backing such a delay, the move still needs approval from the powerful central committee and parliament.
392	AFP_ENG_20070313.0112.LDC2009T13	Zhou said a decision by Mugabe to stand in presidential elections in 2008 was a result of simmering opposition in the ruling party to the plan to postpone the presidential elections by two years.
393	AFP_ENG_20070313.0112.LDC2009T13	"There is a feeling within ZANU-PF that he should step down in 2008 as he indicated.
394	AFP_ENG_20070313.0112.LDC2009T13	There are about three factions now jostling for the post but the problem is that no-one has emerged so far who commands the respect Mugabe commands in ZANU-PF."
395	AFP_ENG_20070313.0112.LDC2009T13	Elphus Mukonoweshuro, a political science professor at the University of Zimbabwe, said ZANU-PF had been split since Mugabe suggested three years ago that he would step down at the end of his current term and senior members of the party started jostling to succeed him.
396	AFP_ENG_20070313.0112.LDC2009T13	When Joyce Mujuru was elevated to vice-president in December 2004, Mugabe appeared to have annointed her as his successor, saying she was destined for higher office.
397	AFP_ENG_20070313.0112.LDC2009T13	"Mugabe locked himself into an irreversible groove to departure," Mukonoweshuro said.
398	AFP_ENG_20070313.0112.LDC2009T13	"Now he is trying to undo it.
399	AFP_ENG_20070313.0112.LDC2009T13	His party is split and he appears to have run out of any strategy to wield together a sustainable coalition of support.
400	AFP_ENG_20070313.0112.LDC2009T13	"The factions have weakened Mugabe's support base.
401	AFP_ENG_20070313.0112.LDC2009T13	He has been reduced to a weak leader struggling to build his own independent faction."
402	AFP_ENG_20070313.0112.LDC2009T13	Relations with Mujuru appear to have significantly cooled, and she was noticeably from Mugabe's birthday celebrations last month.
403	AFP_ENG_20070313.0112.LDC2009T13	A recent report by the International Crisis Group, a Brussels- based thinktank, said that Mujuru's husband Solomon was "leading the campaign to force Mugabe into retirement when his term expires in 2008."
404	AFP_ENG_20070313.0112.LDC2009T13	"ZANU-PF officials say Mujuru's argument resonates with other key party leaders, though many are afraid to openly denounce Mugabe's proposal," the ICG added.
405	AFP_ENG_20070313.0112.LDC2009T13	While Mugabe has had to endure a raft of public sector strikes, the security forces have so far remained loyal to him.
406	AFP_ENG_20070313.0112.LDC2009T13	Zhou said that their continued support was crucial to Mugabe's survival strategy and saw little sign of their changing sides.
407	AFP_ENG_20070313.0112.LDC2009T13	"If the armed forces take sides with him, he will use the armed forces against the internal opposition," said Zhou.
408	AFP_ENG_20070313.0112.LDC2009T13	"If the armed forces join the side of the one of the factions, then the armed forces could also turn against him.
409	AFP_ENG_20070313.0112.LDC2009T13	This is highly unlikely, considering the history of the armed forces."

411	AFP_ENG_20070313.0733.LDC2009T13	At least six people were killed and several others wounded Wednesday in a massive explosion at a shop selling gunpowder in the centre of the Afghan capital Kabul, police said.
412	AFP_ENG_20070313.0733.LDC2009T13	The blast took place in a bazaar where hunting rifles, gunpowder and bullets are sold near the presidential palace, government offices and the headquarters of NATO's International Security Assistance Force (ISAF).
413	AFP_ENG_20070313.0733.LDC2009T13	Police said the explosion was caused by exploding gunpowder, but an intelligence officer said it was a bomb blast.
414	AFP_ENG_20070313.0733.LDC2009T13	Afghan soldiers, police and firefighters poured into the area.
415	AFP_ENG_20070313.0733.LDC2009T13	A police colonel at the scene who asked not to be named said six people were dead and eight wounded.
416	AFP_ENG_20070313.0733.LDC2009T13	"So far we have recovered seven to eight bodies -- most of them dead, some of them in a coma," a district police commander, Abdul Rahman Rahimi, told AFP.
417	AFP_ENG_20070313.0733.LDC2009T13	The explosion destroyed a row of mudbrick shops and left a three- metre (10-foot) crater in the ground, an AFP reporter at the scene said.
418	AFP_ENG_20070313.0733.LDC2009T13	"We heard a huge explosion from one of the shops," said Ahmad Fahim, who runs a bakery in the area.
419	AFP_ENG_20070313.0733.LDC2009T13	"There were people in most of the shops.
420	AFP_ENG_20070313.0733.LDC2009T13	There are still bodies underneath the rubble."
421	AFP_ENG_20070313.0733.LDC2009T13	People had started combing through the debris with their bare hands and shovels to recover bodies.
422	AFP_ENG_20070313.0733.LDC2009T13	The blast sent a column of dust and smoke into the air.
423	AFP_ENG_20070313.0733.LDC2009T13	ISAF could not immediately confirm what had caused the explosion.
424	AFP_ENG_20070313.0733.LDC2009T13	"We heard the blast, we went outside and we saw a huge plume of smoke about half a mile south of ISAF," ISAF spokesman Colonel Tom Collins told AFP.

426	AFP_ENG_20070316.0265.LDC2009T13	Berlin preparing possible flotation of regional bank LBB
427	AFP_ENG_20070316.0265.LDC2009T13	The city-state authorities of Berlin are preparing a flotation of the regional bank Landesbank Berlin (LBB) as a possible alternative to a straightforward sale, a mandatory legal filing published in the German press revealed on Friday.
428	AFP_ENG_20070316.0265.LDC2009T13	Berlin has been ordered to sell its 80.95-percent stake in LBB, which is already listed on the stock exchange, by the EU competition authorities.
429	AFP_ENG_20070316.0265.LDC2009T13	And a total 19 groups -- public and private sector banks and financial investors -- have so far expressed an interest in buying the stake.
430	AFP_ENG_20070316.0265.LDC2009T13	But floating the stake on the stock exchange by way of a so- called secondary public offering (SPO) is now also being seen as a possible option.
431	AFP_ENG_20070316.0265.LDC2009T13	A secondary public offering is the issuance of new stock for public sale from a company that is already listed.
432	AFP_ENG_20070316.0265.LDC2009T13	According to the legal notice published in the daily Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, Berlin's advisor bank UBS is asking banks who would be interested in co-managing the secondary offering to step forward by April 2.
433	AFP_ENG_20070316.0265.LDC2009T13	The city-state's finance senator, Thilo Sarrazin, had said in January that Berlin would chose between the options of a direct sale and a flotation before June.
434	AFP_ENG_20070316.0349.LDC2009T13	Arab press has mixed hopes for Palestinian government
435	AFP_ENG_20070316.0349.LDC2009T13	The new Palestinian unity government provides a "golden opportunity" for lasting peace in the Middle East, but will be scuppered by Western powers and Israel, Gulf Arab media said on Friday.
436	AFP_ENG_20070316.0349.LDC2009T13	Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas and Palestinian prime minister-designate Ismail Haniya on Thursday finalised an agreement on a national unity government combining their rival Fatah and Hamas factions.
437	AFP_ENG_20070316.0349.LDC2009T13	The Saudi daily Al-Watan greeted the deal with optimism, saying it gave Israel "a golden opportunity to achieve a lasting and comprehensive peace in the region."
438	AFP_ENG_20070316.0349.LDC2009T13	Peace, based on Israel's withdrawal from Arab lands seized in the 1967 war, is now possible because the new government "represents the overwhelming majority of the Palestinian people and is in a position to deliver on any commitments required by a peace deal," the paper wrote.
439	AFP_ENG_20070316.0349.LDC2009T13	Arab leaders are due to hold a summit in the Saudi capital, Riyadh, at the end of the month.
440	AFP_ENG_20070316.0349.LDC2009T13	The paper said the Arab League is expected to re-endorse a plan agreed in 2002 that would recognise Israel and establish normal ties with her in return for a full Israeli withdrawal to the June 4, 1967 borders.
441	AFP_ENG_20070316.0349.LDC2009T13	Al-Watan said US hunger for foreign policy success following its failure in Iraq, coupled with Europe's renewed appetite for diplomacy in the region, boost prospects for lasting peace.
442	AFP_ENG_20070316.0349.LDC2009T13	But a note a scepticism was struck elsewhere in the oil-rich Gulf region.
443	AFP_ENG_20070316.0349.LDC2009T13	The United Arab Emirates' Al-Khaleej predicted that both Israel and Western nations would seek to derail the Hamas-Fatah cabinet.
444	AFP_ENG_20070316.0349.LDC2009T13	Israel would try to keep the Palestinian government "busy with its differences" by allowing some ministers to do their jobs while hindering others, the newspaper said.
445	AFP_ENG_20070316.0349.LDC2009T13	The United States would exacerbate disputes inside the Palestinian government "through its demands that serve Israeli goals," and the European Union would impose debilitating conditions, the newspaper added.
446	AFP_ENG_20070316.0349.LDC2009T13	It urged the unity government to concentrate on day-to-day political affairs until it formulates a "unified programme" that would end Israeli occupation and restore Palestinian rights.
447	AFP_ENG_20070316.0349.LDC2009T13	In Lebanon, the leftist opposition daily As-Safir said both Palestinian factions had surmounted great obstacles placed in their way on the road to the accord.
448	AFP_ENG_20070316.0349.LDC2009T13	"Notably, they avoided the 'mines' placed on the path, by Israel from nearby and by the United States from afar," it said.
449	AFP_ENG_20070316.0349.LDC2009T13	"Counting on foreign states does not help to build a nation," As- Safir said.
450	AFP_ENG_20070316.0349.LDC2009T13	It added that the Palestinians were able to reach agreement because each party made concessions, "even though the government will be able to exercise no more than municipal powers" because of Israeli politics.
451	AFP_ENG_20070316.0351.LDC2009T13	Cuba might cut into Imperial Tobacco bid for Altadis: analysts
452	AFP_ENG_20070316.0351.LDC2009T13	Cuba might upset a likely takeover bid by Imperial Tobacco for Spanish-French group Altadis because it has an option to buy the cigar division, press reports and analysts said on Friday.
453	AFP_ENG_20070316.0351.LDC2009T13	The Spanish newspaper ElEconomista aid that Cuban leader Fidel castro "is not prepared to share the equity with a British company."
454	AFP_ENG_20070316.0351.LDC2009T13	The possibility for Communist Cuba to disrupt a takeover on the stock market arises because Cuba has an option to buy the cigar business if its shareholding structure changes, they said.
455	AFP_ENG_20070316.0351.LDC2009T13	Asked about the possible move by Cuba by AFP in France and Spain on Friday, Altadis declined to comment and did not confirm that such a pre-emption clause on the cigar business Corporacion Habanos existed.
456	AFP_ENG_20070316.0351.LDC2009T13	The offshoot has been owned equally by Altadis and by the Cuban government since 2000 when Altadis bought its 50-percent interest.
457	AFP_ENG_20070316.0351.LDC2009T13	The business, Corporacion Habanos, is considered to be a jewel in the Altadis group, owning the brands of Montecristo, Cohiba, Romeo y Julieta and Partagas.
458	AFP_ENG_20070316.0351.LDC2009T13	It accounts for 22.0 percent of group sales and 24.0 percent of gross operating margin.
459	AFP_ENG_20070316.0351.LDC2009T13	ElEconomista said the Cuban option could be a major obstacle to a takeover.
460	AFP_ENG_20070316.0351.LDC2009T13	At brokers Societe Generale, analysts said Imperial Tobacco would want to retain the cigar business and would want to be sure of support from Altadis to negotiate an agreement with Cuba.
461	AFP_ENG_20070316.0351.LDC2009T13	This might mean that Imperial Tobacco would have to raise its proposed terms of 45 euros per share, valuing the group at about 11.5 billion euros (15.2 billion dollars), they said, estimating that it might have to go to 49 euros.
462	AFP_ENG_20070316.0351.LDC2009T13	Brokers Lehman Brothers said Imperial might have to offer 48 euros.
463	AFP_ENG_20070316.0351.LDC2009T13	In late afternoon trading here, the Altadis shares were being quoted at 45.5 euros in heavy dealing.
464	AFP_ENG_20070316.0351.LDC2009T13	At brokers Caja Madrid, analysts said they thought that British American Tobacco might make a counter offer, saying: "We are a stage where it is 'now or never' in the tobacco market because this could be the last big operation in the sector."

470	AFP_ENG_20070323.0042.LDC2009T13	Wu Ping's modest two-storey brick dwelling in Chongqing city is now one of the most recognisable homes in China thanks to widely circulated pictures of the structure sitting defiantly in the middle of an excavated construction pit.
471	AFP_ENG_20070323.0042.LDC2009T13	A court-set deadline for her to relent passed on Thursday but the 49-year-old Wu, dubbed the "stubborn nail" by Chinese media, vowed to fight on in a case that has highlighted the widespread property disputes in China.
472	AFP_ENG_20070323.0042.LDC2009T13	"I'm not stubborn or unruly, I'm just trying to protect my personal rights as a citizen.
473	AFP_ENG_20070323.0042.LDC2009T13	I will continue to the end," Wu was quoted as saying in the state-run Legal Daily on Friday.
474	AFP_ENG_20070323.0042.LDC2009T13	After accepting compensation offers from the builders of the planned residential complex, 280 households have moved out.
475	AFP_ENG_20070323.0042.LDC2009T13	But Wu, who now lives elsewhere due to difficulty accessing her home, has not budged even as bulldozers excavated the site around her.
476	AFP_ENG_20070323.0042.LDC2009T13	A legal battle has raged since she rejected the compensation offer as she has maintained that she cannot be forced to move out.
477	AFP_ENG_20070323.0042.LDC2009T13	A local court ordered her to allow the structure to be torn down by Thursday, although she continued to refuse and it was not immediately clear what steps authorities would take next.
478	AFP_ENG_20070323.0042.LDC2009T13	Property disputes are rife in China, often involving illegal land grabs by developers in collusion the government.
479	AFP_ENG_20070323.0042.LDC2009T13	The national parliament passed a landmark law solidifying private property rights this month partly to combat such disputes.
480	AFP_ENG_20070323.0042.LDC2009T13	Wu's case has generated wide discussion in the media and Chinese blogs.

482	AFP_ENG_20070323.0042.LDC2009T13	"If the government does not respect people's rights in the case, it will raise suspicions about the entanglement of civil rights, property development and government interests."

484	AFP_ENG_20070324.0259.LDC2009T13	Canada is set to open its first trial for crimes against humanity on Monday, with a Rwandan in the dock accused of taking part in the country's 1994 genocide of ethnic Tutsis.
485	AFP_ENG_20070324.0259.LDC2009T13	Desire Munyaneza, 40, is accused of involvement in the rape and killing of civilians in Butare, southern Rwanda, from April to July, 1994.
486	AFP_ENG_20070324.0259.LDC2009T13	Witnesses from the African country are to testify at his trial in the Quebec high court.
487	AFP_ENG_20070324.0259.LDC2009T13	About 800,000 people, most of them Tutsis, were killed within six weeks in Rwanda by members of the Hutu ethnic group.
488	AFP_ENG_20070324.0259.LDC2009T13	The genocide followed years of tension between the two groups and was sparked by the death of president Juvenal Habyarimana, a Hutu, in a plane crash.

490	AFP_ENG_20070324.0259.LDC2009T13	Munyaneza went into exile in Cameroon after the genocide, before coming to Canada in 1997 to seek asylum.
491	AFP_ENG_20070324.0259.LDC2009T13	This request was turned down by Canada because of his suspected role in the atrocities.

502	AFP_ENG_20070330.0721.LDC2009T13	The Brazilian government and striking air traffic controllers reached agreement late Friday about ending a strike that has closed 49 of the nation's busiest airports, local television reported.
503	AFP_ENG_20070330.0721.LDC2009T13	Globo TV reported the deal was reached during an emergency meeting between members of the Brazilian cabinet and unions representing the controllers.

509	AFP_ENG_20070401.0055.LDC2009T13	Head coach Orjan Madsen Sunday slammed his limp German team's performance at the world championships, saying a gap has increased between his swimmers and the leading nations.
510	AFP_ENG_20070401.0055.LDC2009T13	The Germans, who came here with expectations of success in the wake of world record times by their women swimmers, led by Britta Steffen, at last year's European championships, failed to win a single gold.
511	AFP_ENG_20070401.0055.LDC2009T13	That ranked them 13th overall on the medal tally behind the United States, Australia and France.
512	AFP_ENG_20070401.0055.LDC2009T13	"The reality is that we stayed far behind our expectations.
513	AFP_ENG_20070401.0055.LDC2009T13	We expected a much better performance than our athletes showed," Madsen said.
514	AFP_ENG_20070401.0055.LDC2009T13	"We need to change things.
515	AFP_ENG_20070401.0055.LDC2009T13	We swam too slow and the world class athletes swam faster than we expected.
516	AFP_ENG_20070401.0055.LDC2009T13	The gap has increased.
517	AFP_ENG_20070401.0055.LDC2009T13	"These results are possibly an advantage.
518	AFP_ENG_20070401.0055.LDC2009T13	If something goes wrong, people are more eager to question themselves in order to find out what went wrong and what needs to be done in the future. "
519	AFP_ENG_20070401.0055.LDC2009T13	Madsen said cultural differences were exposed at the championships between his swimmers and the Americans.
520	AFP_ENG_20070401.0055.LDC2009T13	"Some of the media have compared us to the United States and pointed out how relaxed and self-confident they are," he said.
521	AFP_ENG_20070401.0055.LDC2009T13	"The way we sit here today, which feels like a funeral, shows the cultural differences between us and the United States."
522	AFP_ENG_20070401.0055.LDC2009T13	"It can be said that we swim on a world class level.
523	AFP_ENG_20070401.0055.LDC2009T13	But if we want to compete on a world class level, we'll need to behave in a way that it looks like we want to be world class.

528	AFP_ENG_20070401.0408.LDC2009T13	Iran confirmed on Sunday that it was in direct talks with Britain over 15 British naval personnel captured off Iraq, saying contacts had never been cut.
529	AFP_ENG_20070401.0408.LDC2009T13	"They were never cut and so there was no need to restart them," an Iranian official told AFP, speaking under condition of anonymity.
530	AFP_ENG_20070401.0408.LDC2009T13	"And the sign for this is that the two countries' foreign ministries have been exchanging messages.
531	AFP_ENG_20070401.0408.LDC2009T13	Iran has never wanted to close the diplomatic path, unless the British government creates such conditions."
532	AFP_ENG_20070401.0408.LDC2009T13	In an interview from Afghanistan earlier Sunday, British Defence Secretary Des Browne said: "We are in direct bilateral communication with the Iranians and they know that not only are we in a very clear position but that we have the support of almost all of the international community."
533	AFP_ENG_20070401.0408.LDC2009T13	The Iranian official said contacts between the two sides might have borne fruit more rapidly had it not been for the strongly critical tone of comments made by British government ministers.
534	AFP_ENG_20070401.0408.LDC2009T13	"To show its good faith and despite the fact that the sailors were arrested in our territorial waters, Iran said that it was ready to release the only female sailor, but due to the kind of comments being made by the British government the matter was postponed," the official said.
535	AFP_ENG_20070401.0408.LDC2009T13	Iran had said that it was ready to release woman sailor Faye Turney but on Thursday the head of Iran's supreme national security council, Ali Larijani, said she would not be freed because of Britain's "incorrect" attitude.
536	AFP_ENG_20070401.0408.LDC2009T13	Larijani's comment came after Britian announced it was suspending all contacts with Iran not specifically related to the case of the 15 naval personnel who were detained off Iraq on March 23.

538	AFP_ENG_20070405.0107.LDC2009T13	US House speaker Nancy Pelosi was due to visit an all-male advisory council in key ally Saudi Arabia Thursday after discussing Iraq with King Abdullah on the last leg of a controversial Middle East trip.
539	AFP_ENG_20070405.0107.LDC2009T13	Pelosi, whose earlier stop in Syria has been fiercely criticised by the White House, met the Saudi monarch on Wednesday, one week after he slammed US control of Iraq as "an illegitimate foreign occupation" and warned that the country could slide into a sectarian civil war.
540	AFP_ENG_20070405.0107.LDC2009T13	Abdullah and the leading US Democrat discussed "the whole range of developments on the regional and international scenes, chiefly those pertaining to the Palestinian issue and the situation in Iraq," official Saudi media said.
541	AFP_ENG_20070405.0107.LDC2009T13	He had blasted the US occupation of Iraq at an Arab summit in Riyadh which revived a five-year-old Saudi plan that offers Israel normal relations if it withdraws from all land seized in the 1967 war and allows the creation of a Palestinian state and the return of Palestinian refugees.
542	AFP_ENG_20070405.0107.LDC2009T13	Pelosi's spokesman Nadeam Elshami told AFP her talks with the king covered "issues in conjunction with the Arab summit and peace and stability in the Middle East," including Iraq as well as the conflicts in Darfur and Somalia.
543	AFP_ENG_20070405.0107.LDC2009T13	Oil powerhouse Saudi Arabia led the drive to relaunch the Saudi peace blueprint amid concern in the Sunni-dominated kingdom about the violence in Iraq between the once ruling minority Sunnis and the majority governing Shiites who are close to Iran, the region's Shiite heavyweight.
544	AFP_ENG_20070405.0107.LDC2009T13	Analysts said the king's criticism reflected a belief that the US administration's strategy in Iraq is doomed as well as frustration that President George W. Bush has rejected a Saudi- brokered power-sharing deal between US-backed Palestinian moderates and the militant Islamist group Hamas.
545	AFP_ENG_20070405.0107.LDC2009T13	The Bush administration, which is fighting attempts by the Democratic-controlled Congress to set a timetable for the pullout of US troops from Iraq, has accused Pelosi of undermining efforts to isolate the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad over its alleged support of terrorism and purported meddling in Iraq and Lebanon.
546	AFP_ENG_20070405.0107.LDC2009T13	Pelosi has shrugged off the accusation and said after meeting Assad on Wednesday that she wanted to help promote peace between Syria and Israel.
547	AFP_ENG_20070405.0107.LDC2009T13	But Israel promptly issued a string of demands it wanted satisfied over Syria's alleged support of terrorism and close links to Iran before any "real" peace talks could begin.
548	AFP_ENG_20070405.0107.LDC2009T13	Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert has said he was ready to attend a meeting with Arab leaders to discuss the revived peace plan but has been accused by the Arab League of seeking normalised ties without making concessions.
549	AFP_ENG_20070405.0107.LDC2009T13	Pelosi was due to meet with members of Saudi Arabia's Shura (consultative) Council, a 150-strong body appointed by the king, becoming the first US House speaker to do so.
550	AFP_ENG_20070405.0107.LDC2009T13	The council does not include any women, who are subjected to a host of restrictions in conservative Muslim Saudi Arabia.
551	AFP_ENG_20070405.0107.LDC2009T13	But Mohammad Ibrahim al-Hulwah, who sits on the council's foreign affairs committee and Saudi-US friendship committee, told AFP that some female members of European and other parliaments had visited the council before.
552	AFP_ENG_20070405.0107.LDC2009T13	Pelosi's delegation includes Democrat Keith Ellison, the first Muslim elected to the US Congress.
553	AFP_ENG_20070405.0107.LDC2009T13	Pelosi, who met Israeli and Palestinian leaders and also visited Lebanon during her tour, was due to meet Saudi Interior Minister Prince Nayef bin Abdul Aziz, according to her spokesman.
554	AFP_ENG_20070405.0107.LDC2009T13	She will leave early Friday.

569	AFP_ENG_20070421.0033.LDC2009T13	Anti-recruitment groups are slamming a US Army deal to sponsor a computer war game channel, charging that real war is no game.
570	AFP_ENG_20070421.0033.LDC2009T13	In June, the Army is set to sponsor a channel at the Global Gaming League website, a popular spot for Internet computer game lovers.
571	AFP_ENG_20070421.0033.LDC2009T13	"It is part of this campaign for the last 20 years to invade youth culture with militarism," Project on Youth and Non-military Opportunities co-founder Rick Jahnkow told AFP.
572	AFP_ENG_20070421.0033.LDC2009T13	"It affects the way young people think.
573	AFP_ENG_20070421.0033.LDC2009T13	It affects their world view.
574	AFP_ENG_20070421.0033.LDC2009T13	That is a very dangerous thing."
575	AFP_ENG_20070421.0033.LDC2009T13	A first-person shooter game based on the army training manual will be a centerpiece of the channel, which will feature other games in the same genre.
576	AFP_ENG_20070421.0033.LDC2009T13	The "America's Army" game was released about five years ago and ranks in the top 10 most popular computer games of its kind, according to McCann World Group vice president Anders Ekman, who is handling the project for the Army.
577	AFP_ENG_20070421.0033.LDC2009T13	Play at the channel will be free, but agreeing to "additional contact from the Army" comes with signing up as a player.

584	AFP_ENG_20070421.0033.LDC2009T13	'Game over' means you come home in a body bag and a casket."
585	AFP_ENG_20070421.0033.LDC2009T13	Castro recounted meeting young gamers inspired to be soldiers by their love of playing America's Army.
586	AFP_ENG_20070421.0033.LDC2009T13	"It was really bizarre to actually see that," Castro said.
587	AFP_ENG_20070421.0033.LDC2009T13	"They had every plan to go into the military and they didn't have a full vision of how the military works."
588	AFP_ENG_20070421.0033.LDC2009T13	Army recruiters resorting to online games is the newest development in a pattern that has "alarmed" Jahnkow since the United State eliminated the military draft near the close of the Vietnam War.
589	AFP_ENG_20070421.0033.LDC2009T13	The military began using mass marketing and sophisticated sales techniques that not only win recruits but make US society more accepting to war as the way to deal with problems, according to Jahnkow.
590	AFP_ENG_20070421.0033.LDC2009T13	"The emphasis went from asking people to join military as a patriotic gesture to more along the lines of the ways companies sell tooth paste," Jahnkow said.
591	AFP_ENG_20070421.0033.LDC2009T13	"Having the military making and marketing entertainment and computer products has never been their mission in our society."
592	AFP_ENG_20070421.0033.LDC2009T13	Recruitment ads that depict soldiers as valiant knights in shining armor and computer games in which battle is exhilarating glamorize militarism as opposed to democracy, Jahnkow said.
593	AFP_ENG_20070421.0033.LDC2009T13	"Soldiering is being popularized when in fact we are supposed to be teaching people from an early age that civilian democratic rule is the ideal," Jahnkow said.
594	AFP_ENG_20070421.0033.LDC2009T13	"I can only imaging what James Madison and George Washington -- all of the founding fathers -- would have thought.
595	AFP_ENG_20070421.0033.LDC2009T13	They must be turning over in their graves right now."
596	AFP_ENG_20070421.0033.LDC2009T13	Jahnkow cited the war in Iraq as a "prime example" of the result of letting the military use games and advertising to sell soldiering to the public.
597	AFP_ENG_20070421.0033.LDC2009T13	The US launched a war in Iraq even though there was no threat to the United States and no connection between Iraq and the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks in New York City and Washington, Jahnkow said.
598	AFP_ENG_20070421.0033.LDC2009T13	"You need to influence people from early childhood to have people grow up and support those kinds of war," Jahnkow said.
599	AFP_ENG_20070421.0033.LDC2009T13	"It is really a question of militarism

602	AFP_ENG_20070421.0439.LDC2009T13	Australia's Matthew Hayden has said there is no great mystery to his succcess after carving out another place in cricket's record books at the World Cup.
603	AFP_ENG_20070421.0439.LDC2009T13	The opening batsman's 103 in the champions 215-run Super Eights thrashing of fellow semi-finalists New Zealand saw him equal the record of three hundreds at a World Cup held jointly by Australia's Mark Waugh and India's Sourav Ganguly.
604	AFP_ENG_20070421.0439.LDC2009T13	It was also the 35-year-old Queensland left-hander's fifth hundred in 21 one-day international innings after he was dropped for the Champions Trophy in India in October and November, a run that included his Australia record 181 not out against New Zealand in Hamilton in February.
605	AFP_ENG_20070421.0439.LDC2009T13	Hayden, this World Cup's leading run-scorer with 580 at an average of 82.85 and an all-time Australian tournament best of 158 against Wednesday's semi-final opponents South Africa in a group match in St Kitts last month, is renowned for his methodical approach.
606	AFP_ENG_20070421.0439.LDC2009T13	This will even extend to walking out onto the pitch in his socks the day before a game to get used to his surroundings.
607	AFP_ENG_20070421.0439.LDC2009T13	"There's no replacing hard work," said Hayden.
608	AFP_ENG_20070421.0439.LDC2009T13	"I had a bit of a boost going to New Zealand before this competition, on similar wickets."
609	AFP_ENG_20070421.0439.LDC2009T13	However, he insisted his approach was common throughout the Australia squad.
610	AFP_ENG_20070421.0439.LDC2009T13	"There's not one bloke that's not doing as much work as the other.
611	AFP_ENG_20070421.0439.LDC2009T13	It's not just me in this scenario, I've enjoyed great partnerships along the way," explained Hayden.
612	AFP_ENG_20070421.0439.LDC2009T13	The opener put on 137 for the second wicket against New Zealand in Grenada with captain Ricky Ponting on Friday during the biggest defeat suffered by a Test side at a World Cup.
613	AFP_ENG_20070421.0439.LDC2009T13	"We've worked very hard throughout the (southern) summer on our one-day game and all elements of our game," added Hayden.
614	AFP_ENG_20070421.0439.LDC2009T13	"It's no surprise that we are here at a World Cup at the height of our games.
615	AFP_ENG_20070421.0439.LDC2009T13	We are looking forward now to the next two games.
616	AFP_ENG_20070421.0439.LDC2009T13	All of what we've been able to achieve means nothing if we don't go all the way.
617	AFP_ENG_20070421.0439.LDC2009T13	"Day in, day out, this side just desperately wants to complete its skills and give itself every chance to play good cricket.
618	AFP_ENG_20070421.0439.LDC2009T13	"That's the discipline of training, the discipline of what we've been able to achieve over the last seven weeks.
619	AFP_ENG_20070421.0439.LDC2009T13	More than anything this side loves big games and big occasions."

625	AFP_ENG_20070424.0518.LDC2009T13	A Slovenian brown bear imported to France last year has given birth to two cubs, the French hunting and wildlife agency, ONCFS, said Tuesday.

633	AFP_ENG_20070425.0475.LDC2009T13	Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, already weakened by a string of headline- grabbing scandals, was on Wednesday threatened with another criminal probe into suspected corruption.
634	AFP_ENG_20070425.0475.LDC2009T13	Recommendations for a criminal inquiry were made in a report presented by Israel's public watchdog to parliament, the premier and attorney general, examining a suspected conflict of interest while Olmert was a cabinet minister.
635	AFP_ENG_20070425.0475.LDC2009T13	The findings whipped up renewed resignation calls against Olmert, whose ratings have sunk to historic lows, just days before findings are to published from a potentially damning report into last year's Lebanon war.
636	AFP_ENG_20070425.0475.LDC2009T13	State Comptroller Micha Lindenstrauss accused Olmert of trying to advance a former business partner's interests by extending state funds to help him set up a factory in southern Israel while trade and industry minister.
637	AFP_ENG_20070425.0475.LDC2009T13	In Israel, only attorney general Menachem Mazuz has the power to order the opening of a criminal investigation against a sitting prime minister.
638	AFP_ENG_20070425.0475.LDC2009T13	"The investigation has revealed suspicions of criminal activities, the state comptroller has presented his conclusions to the attorney general," said the top public watchdog's office in a statement.

640	AFP_ENG_20070425.0475.LDC2009T13	The former business partner in question is lawyer Uriel Meser, who is widely credited with having Olmert elected as Jerusalem mayor in 1998.
641	AFP_ENG_20070425.0475.LDC2009T13	In a statement carried by the online news site Ynet, the prime minister's office said in response that Olmert had lost his faith in the top public watchdog.
642	AFP_ENG_20070425.0475.LDC2009T13	"The comptroller's conduct has unfortunately once again broken records of unprofessional behaviour and favouritism in his work," a statement said.
643	AFP_ENG_20070425.0475.LDC2009T13	Lindenstrauss has previously recommended a criminal probe into appointments that Olmert made during his stint as trade and industry minister.
644	AFP_ENG_20070425.0475.LDC2009T13	Members of the left- and right-wing political opposition swiftly stepped up calls for the 61-year-old Olmert to resign.

748	AFP_ENG_20070522.0585.LDC2009T13	The man behind a notorious pyramid financial scheme that defrauded thousands of Russians in the 1990s was released from prison on Tuesday, Russia's Interfax news agency reported.
749	AFP_ENG_20070522.0585.LDC2009T13	Sergei Mavrodi, head of the MMM scheme, had served four- and-a-half years in prison for fraud.
750	AFP_ENG_20070522.0585.LDC2009T13	He was arrested in 2003 after six years on the run from Russian authorities, the report said.
751	AFP_ENG_20070522.0585.LDC2009T13	In his trial, he was charged with defrauding some 40,000 people, though thousands of others also lost money through MMM and he continues to inspire strong feelings among Russians.
752	AFP_ENG_20070522.0585.LDC2009T13	The amount of money lost is estimated at 100 million dollars.
753	AFP_ENG_20070522.0585.LDC2009T13	Mavrodi's share scheme lured millions of Russians by promising sky-high annual returns.
754	AFP_ENG_20070522.0585.LDC2009T13	But the venture collapsed and Mavrodi was put under investigation for tax evasion.

756	AFP_ENG_20070522.0597.LDC2009T13	Billionaire investor Kirk Kerkorian has made a new play in Las Vegas, bidding through his personal holding company for a big MGM Mirage casino and mixed-use development in the US gaming capital.
757	AFP_ENG_20070522.0597.LDC2009T13	Kerkorian, through his private investment company, Tracinda Corp., already owns 56.3 percent of the MGM Mirage conglomerate whose portfolio includes some of the biggest properties on the Las Vegas Strip, including Bellagio, MGM Grand and Luxor.
758	AFP_ENG_20070522.0597.LDC2009T13	But in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission late Monday, Tracinda said it wanted to buy the Bellagio along with MGM Mirage's CityCenter, a multibillion-dollar complex of hotels, a resort casino-hotel, private residences and a shopping center being built near the Bellagio.
759	AFP_ENG_20070522.0597.LDC2009T13	The reasons were not immediately clear why Kerkorian wanted to move those assets from MGM to his personal holding company.
760	AFP_ENG_20070522.0597.LDC2009T13	But Tracinda said in the filing "it also wishes to pursue strategic alternatives with respect to its investment in MGM Mirage which may include financial restructuring transactions involving all or a substantial portion of the remainder of the company."
761	AFP_ENG_20070522.0597.LDC2009T13	Shares in MGM Mirage hit the jackpot Tuesday, climbing 27 percent to 79.95 dollars in early afternoon trade, easing back from an intraday high of 82.25 dollars.
762	AFP_ENG_20070522.0597.LDC2009T13	MGM, whose shareholders hold their annual meeting Tuesday, said it would study the offer and respond "in due course."
763	AFP_ENG_20070522.0597.LDC2009T13	Several analysts point out the potential benefits of the Tracinda proposal, which would refocus MGM Mirage around its core gaming business.
764	AFP_ENG_20070522.0597.LDC2009T13	Calyon, a corporate and investment bank, estimated the value of the combined Bellagio and CityCenter properties at 11.5-12.0 billion dollars -- 6.0 billion for the casino-hotel and 5.5 billion for the urban complex.
765	AFP_ENG_20070522.0597.LDC2009T13	MGM Mirage said last month it had revised upward the estimated cost of construction of the CityCenter project to 7.4 billion dollars.
766	AFP_ENG_20070522.0597.LDC2009T13	MGM Mirage could decide to keep a minority stake in the Bellagio- City Center duo and thus share its profits.
767	AFP_ENG_20070522.0597.LDC2009T13	Calyon raised its share price estimate for MGM Mirage to 85-90 dollars.
768	AFP_ENG_20070522.0597.LDC2009T13	If Kerkorian succeeds, the Bank of America said, the restructuring of MGM Mirage "could push valuation even higher than their 80-dollar target" to a share price around 85-95 dollars.
769	AFP_ENG_20070522.0597.LDC2009T13	Analysts at brokerage Susquehanna said the development "raises the specter of another wave of privatization transactions in the gaming space."

771	AFP_ENG_20070523.0043.LDC2009T13	Crescent Real Estate, a US investment firm whose portfolio includes commercial and resort residential properties, has agreed to be bought by investment bank Morgan Stanley for 6.5 billion dollars.
772	AFP_ENG_20070523.0043.LDC2009T13	Crescent Real Estate Equities Co. announced late Tuesday the takeover deal with Morgan Stanley Real Estate, the real estate investment arm of the US investment bank.
773	AFP_ENG_20070523.0043.LDC2009T13	The Crescent board of trust managers unanimously approved the acquisition and recommended it to shareholders, the Fort Worth, the Texas-based firm said.
774	AFP_ENG_20070523.0043.LDC2009T13	Morgan Stanley has agreed to pay 22.80 dollars per share, a 12 percent premium of Crescent's average closing price in the past 30 days.
775	AFP_ENG_20070523.0043.LDC2009T13	But the transaction represents a premium shy of 5.5 percent from Tuesday's closing price of 21.62 dollars.
776	AFP_ENG_20070523.0043.LDC2009T13	The agreement also includes Morgan Stanley's assumption of Crescent's debt of 3.1 billion dollars.
777	AFP_ENG_20070523.0043.LDC2009T13	The takeover is expected to be concluded at the end of the third quarter.

780	AFP_ENG_20070523.0043.LDC2009T13	The company has a market capitalization of 2.22 billion dollars, according to its Tuesday closing share price.

784	AFP_ENG_20070525.0065.LDC2009T13	German consumers are increasingly optimistic, despite a steep rise in sales tax at the start of the year, a poll of consumer attitudes in the biggest eurozone economy showed on Friday.
785	AFP_ENG_20070525.0065.LDC2009T13	The consumer sentiment index calculated each month by market research group GfK was forecast to rise to 7.3 points in June from 5.7 points in May, the think- tank said in a statement.
786	AFP_ENG_20070525.0065.LDC2009T13	"The consumer climate has maintained its significant upturn in the early summer of this year," GfK said.
787	AFP_ENG_20070525.0065.LDC2009T13	With the job market and incomes set to be in better shape than last year, "we have upgraded our forecast for growth of private consumption this year to 1.0 percent from our original figure of 0.5 percent," it said.
788	AFP_ENG_20070525.0065.LDC2009T13	For its monthly survey, GfK quizzes about 2,000 consumers on their views on the economic outlook, income expectations and their propensity to buy.
789	AFP_ENG_20070525.0065.LDC2009T13	The responses are then used to calculate an overall consumer climate index and based on the current month's reading, the GfK also provides a forecast as to where it expects the index to stand the following month.
790	AFP_ENG_20070525.0065.LDC2009T13	The survey found that consumers' propensity to buy rose by 2.4 points to minus 4.1 points in May in the third consecutive monthly rise.
791	AFP_ENG_20070525.0065.LDC2009T13	"The weak phase in propensity to buy caused by the VAT increase is an end," GfK found.
792	AFP_ENG_20070525.0065.LDC2009T13	"Consequently, consumers will again be more inclined to loosen their purse strings and make larger purchases."
793	AFP_ENG_20070525.0065.LDC2009T13	The government raised VAT value added, or sales, tax by three full percentage points to 19 percent with effect from January 1, in a move which critics said would stifle consumer spending.
794	AFP_ENG_20070525.0065.LDC2009T13	The data so far indicate that there was indeed a dent in private consumption but that it proved only transitory.
795	AFP_ENG_20070525.0065.LDC2009T13	Households are more optimistic with regard to their future income than they have been in six years, with that sub-index rising by 4.0 points to plus 33.6 points in May.
796	AFP_ENG_20070525.0065.LDC2009T13	The economic expectations sub-index topped a new record high, rising by 8.5 points to 69.5 points, GfK found.
797	AFP_ENG_20070530.0367.LDC2009T13	Gorbachev calls for justice for murdered Russian journalist by Conor Humphries
798	AFP_ENG_20070530.0367.LDC2009T13	Former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev on Wednesday joined the family of murdered Russian journalist Anna Politkovskaya in calling for officials to step up their efforts to find her killers.
799	AFP_ENG_20070530.0367.LDC2009T13	"We must put the question firmly before the law enforcement authorities.
800	AFP_ENG_20070530.0367.LDC2009T13	It should not be like this.
801	AFP_ENG_20070530.0367.LDC2009T13	The criminals in this case must be caught and charged," Gorbachev said at a presentation of Politkovskaya's collected works.
802	AFP_ENG_20070530.0367.LDC2009T13	Released eight months after Politkovskaya was gunned down by unknown assailants in Moscow, "For What" is the first book published under the author's name in Russia since 2002.
803	AFP_ENG_20070530.0367.LDC2009T13	Her books have been published in various European languages since 2001.
804	AFP_ENG_20070530.0367.LDC2009T13	A renowned Kremlin critic, Politkovskaya was famous for her reporting on human rights abuses committed by Russian troops and allied Chechen militias during the two wars Moscow launched in Chechnya since 1994 to contain separatist ambitions there.
805	AFP_ENG_20070530.0367.LDC2009T13	Colleagues and family members used the occasion Wednesday to honour her work and voice their frustration that more is not being done to solve the murder.
806	AFP_ENG_20070530.0367.LDC2009T13	"The worst thing is that we still don't have information about the investigation, although more than eight months have gone past," said Politkovskaya's sister Yelena Kudimova.
807	AFP_ENG_20070530.0367.LDC2009T13	Politkovskaya's former editor Dmitry Muratov said her newspaper would remain silent about the results of its own investigation and watch the official probe closely to see if it would lead anywhere.
808	AFP_ENG_20070530.0367.LDC2009T13	"Our trust has its limits," said Muratov, editor of the semi- weekly opposition newspaper Novaya Gazeta.
809	AFP_ENG_20070530.0367.LDC2009T13	"If after a certain time we are convinced that the investigation is following a forced politicized path, then we will publish all of the material that the newspaper has managed to collect in the past eight months."
810	AFP_ENG_20070530.0367.LDC2009T13	He said that the paper was holding off on releasing details due to the possible danger of "being left one-on-one" with the dangerous individuals behind the crime without the protection of law enforcement.
811	AFP_ENG_20070530.0367.LDC2009T13	Novaya Gazeta on Monday said it had identified two top Chechen officials it suspects of ordering the killing, but declined to name them.
812	AFP_ENG_20070530.0367.LDC2009T13	Speaking to journalists after the presentation, Muratov said that the newspaper's offer of a one-million-dollar (740,000-euro) reward for information in the case "has helped."
813	AFP_ENG_20070530.0367.LDC2009T13	He said a second edition of Politkovskaya's works may be published with details from the newspaper's investigation.
814	AFP_ENG_20070530.0367.LDC2009T13	Despite the frustration over the lack of justice, Politkovskaya's colleagues voiced hope that the posthumous publication would do some justice to the reporter's work.
815	AFP_ENG_20070530.0367.LDC2009T13	"I think people will read this in Russia and around the world," said Gorbachev, a shareholder in Novaya Gazeta, who said he knew Politkovskaya personally.
816	AFP_ENG_20070530.0367.LDC2009T13	"We need to remember people like Anna, who in any situation could maintain their integrity, their honour and their bravery."
817	AFP_ENG_20070530.0367.LDC2009T13	Politkovskaya's son Ilya said that no one had interfered with the book's production and distribution, and that it had become the No. 2 bestselling book in Moscow as of last week.
818	AFP_ENG_20070530.0367.LDC2009T13	"I am happy it has become a bestseller.
819	AFP_ENG_20070530.0367.LDC2009T13	It is just a shame this only happened after her death," he said.

828	AFP_ENG_20070530.0478.LDC2009T13	"That's where I lost my focus a little bit because I saw the 206.

832	AFP_ENG_20070530.0478.LDC2009T13	It was unexpected," added Williams who registered the new mark in the fifth game of the second set when she was leading 4-1.
833	AFP_ENG_20070530.0478.LDC2009T13	Williams set the old mark of 204kmh (127mph) in 1998 in a quarter-final win against Mary Pierce in Zurich which was broken by Dutch veteran Brenda Schultz- McCarthy who hit a serve of 209kmh (130mph) in Cincinnati last July.

882	AFP_ENG_20070616.0053.LDC2009T13	Taiwan has passed part of a controversial arms bill to buy weaponry from the United States in a bid to boost its defence capabilities against China, an official said Saturday.
883	AFP_ENG_20070616.0053.LDC2009T13	Among the arms package, the parliament approved late Friday a total of 6.1 billion Taiwan dollars (184 million US) for the purchase of P-3C anti-submarine aircraft.
884	AFP_ENG_20070616.0053.LDC2009T13	However, it only authorised 200 million dollars out of the proposed 4.5 billion to acquire eight conventional submarines and cut the 11.3 billion-budget for Patriot anti-missile systems.
885	AFP_ENG_20070616.0053.LDC2009T13	Another 16-billion-dollar-budget that proposed to buy 66 F-16 fighter jets was frozen.
886	AFP_ENG_20070616.0053.LDC2009T13	The defence ministry vowed to push for the full approval of arms package in the next parliamentary session.
887	AFP_ENG_20070616.0053.LDC2009T13	"We hope the parliament will reconsider the freezed or cut items on the arms package in order to help enhance Taiwan's defence capabilities," said Yu Sy-tue, a spokesman for the defence ministry.
888	AFP_ENG_20070616.0053.LDC2009T13	The bill had been blocked by the parliament's procedure committee nearly 70 times before it was finally passed in December.
889	AFP_ENG_20070616.0053.LDC2009T13	The 10-billion-US-dollar bill, scaled down from the original 16 billion, called for the purchase of six PAC-3 Patriot anti- missile systems, eight conventional submarines and 12 P-3C aircraft.
890	AFP_ENG_20070616.0053.LDC2009T13	Some opposition lawmakers have said Taiwan cannot afford the arms package while others say the submarines would be delivered too slowly to enable the island to keep pace with China's military build-up.
891	AFP_ENG_20070616.0053.LDC2009T13	The US is the leading arms supplier to Taiwan despite its switch of diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing in 1979.

894	AFP_ENG_20070618.0458.LDC2009T13	Israel's new Defence Minister Ehud Barak was sworn in by parliament on Monday, following his political comeback as new Labour party chairman and Hamas's violent takeover of the Gaza Strip.
895	AFP_ENG_20070618.0458.LDC2009T13	Parliament endorsed the appointment with 46 votes for and 22 against, before Barak was sworn in.
896	AFP_ENG_20070618.0458.LDC2009T13	The cabinet had unanimously approved his nomination as defence minister and deputy premier in a telephone vote on Friday,
897	AFP_ENG_20070618.0458.LDC2009T13	Barak's appointment, made earlier than expected, was "because of the new situation that has evolved," one official said, alluding to the dramatic and bloody takeover of the Gaza Strip by the Palestinian Islamist movement Hamas.
898	AFP_ENG_20070618.0458.LDC2009T13	And on Sunday, militants based in Lebanon fired rockets into Israel for the first time in 10 months, without causing casualties.
899	AFP_ENG_20070618.0458.LDC2009T13	Barak replaces outgoing defence minister Amir Peretz, who lost the Labour party leadership last month and who was heavily criticised as having failed on the job by a partial government inquiry into last year's Lebanon war.
900	AFP_ENG_20070618.0458.LDC2009T13	"The Lebanon war brought to light failings and mistakes dating back several years, for which I had no responsibility but I paid the price," Peretz, who is now leaving the government for the back benches, told parliament.
901	AFP_ENG_20070618.0458.LDC2009T13	Barak, a former chief of staff and defence minister, was last week elected to head Labour -- Olmert's main coalition partner -- staging a spectacular comeback to the national political arena after a more then six-year absence.

904	AFP_ENG_20070618.0478.LDC2009T13	The euro struck a fresh record high against the yen Monday as expectations faded of a quick increase in Japan's ultra-low interest rates, dealers said.
905	AFP_ENG_20070618.0478.LDC2009T13	In late European trading, the euro reached 165.74 yen, up from 165.20 late on Friday in New York.
906	AFP_ENG_20070618.0478.LDC2009T13	The European single currency also rose to 1.3402 dollars, from 1.3385 late on Friday.
907	AFP_ENG_20070618.0478.LDC2009T13	Market players were wary of taking the dollar much lower amid a dearth of significant data, dealers said, but the yen remained firmly under pressure as popularity for the so-called carry trade showed no sign of abating.
908	AFP_ENG_20070618.0478.LDC2009T13	"Traders are still wary of getting aboard the euro/dollar bus after plumbing 1.3265 lows last week," said Peter Wadkins at Thomson IFR Markets.
909	AFP_ENG_20070618.0478.LDC2009T13	He noted that comments from several European Central Bank directors -- Axel Weber, Jose Manuel Gonzalez-Paramo and Nicholas Garganas continued to warn about inflation risks and repeat that monetary policy was accomodative -- had therefore had little impact.
910	AFP_ENG_20070618.0478.LDC2009T13	The dollar has been under pressure since the release of weaker- than-expected US core consumer price index (CPI) data on Friday, which caused the market to scale down its expectations for US interest rate increases.
911	AFP_ENG_20070618.0478.LDC2009T13	The inflation news was compounded by a raft of other weak US data, including industrial production and the latest University of Michigan consumer sentiment reading.
912	AFP_ENG_20070618.0478.LDC2009T13	Meanwhile, the yen remained the weakest performer of the day, hitting a fresh four-and-a-half year low against the dollar of 123.68 yen, a new record low of 165.74 yen per euro, and multi- year lows against the pound.
913	AFP_ENG_20070618.0478.LDC2009T13	The Japanese currency came under renewed pressure Friday after a dovish speech from Bank of Japan governor Toshihiko Fukui suggested that interest rates would not rise again any time soon.
914	AFP_ENG_20070618.0478.LDC2009T13	This has kept the carry trade -- where investors borrow in low- yielding currencies, most typically the yen, to invest in higher- yielding assets elsewhere -- alive and well.
915	AFP_ENG_20070618.0478.LDC2009T13	Later Monday, traders awaited the release of a US housing market index from the National Association of Home Builders, though analysts noted that the absence of many major US data releases this week might stem the dollar's fall.
916	AFP_ENG_20070618.0478.LDC2009T13	"Soft housing data could do further damage to the dollar over the short term, but with a lack of major data releases this week the tone is likely to one of a drift lower rather than a major decline in the currency," said Calyon analyst Mitul Kotecha.
917	AFP_ENG_20070618.0478.LDC2009T13	The euro was changing hands at 1.3402 dollars, against 1.3385 dollars on Friday, 165.74 yen (165.20), 0.6762 pounds (0.6773) and 1.6629 Swiss francs (1.6615).
918	AFP_ENG_20070618.0478.LDC2009T13	The dollar stood at 123.68 yen (123.43) and 1.2410 Swiss francs (1.2412).

927	AFP_ENG_20070620.0180.LDC2009T13	The German federal prosecutor's office said Wednesday it had brought charges against a suspected mastermind behind a failed plot to bomb two German trains last year.
928	AFP_ENG_20070620.0180.LDC2009T13	The office said in a statement it had charged Lebanese national Yusef Mohammed al-Hajj Dib, 22, on June 11 with "an unspecified number of counts of attempted murder."
929	AFP_ENG_20070620.0180.LDC2009T13	A court in the western city of Duesseldorf must now decide whether to put him on trial.
930	AFP_ENG_20070620.0180.LDC2009T13	Dib and Jihad Hamad, who is also Lebanese, are believed to have placed suitcases containing homemade bombs on two regional trains as they passed through Cologne station on July 31.
931	AFP_ENG_20070620.0180.LDC2009T13	The devices failed to detonate, averting an almost certain bloodbath in what German officials said was a bid to copy the train blasts in Madrid and London.
932	AFP_ENG_20070620.0180.LDC2009T13	The German prosecutor's statement said Dib and Hamad "agreed in April 2006 in retaliation for the publication of caricatures of the Prophet Mohammed to mount an attack in the Federal Republic of Germany with homemade bombs."
933	AFP_ENG_20070620.0180.LDC2009T13	Dib was arrested in August and is being tried in absentia in Lebanon, where Hamad and four other alleged accomplices are also on trial.
934	AFP_ENG_20070620.0180.LDC2009T13	Hamad said in a German television interview in November that caricatures of the Prophet Mohammed published in Denmark and reprinted in German newspapers last year led them to plan the attack.

936	AFP_ENG_20070620.0309.LDC2009T13	Students at Zambia's biggest university Wednesday began an indefinite class boycott to protest against poor sanitation at their campus days after staging violent protests, a union official said.
937	AFP_ENG_20070620.0309.LDC2009T13	Riot police have sealed off the campus and roads leading to the University of Zambia in Lusaka, where students holding the boycott were also planning demonstrations, said Mercy Nankamba.
938	AFP_ENG_20070620.0309.LDC2009T13	The protest has been prompted by a decision from the university's management to reduce cleaning staff at student hostels due to lack of funding, Nankamba said.
939	AFP_ENG_20070620.0309.LDC2009T13	"The students are merely expressing their concern over the poor sanitation at the campus," she said.
940	AFP_ENG_20070620.0309.LDC2009T13	Last week, students at the same university staged violent demonstrations, smashing vehicle windows and blocking main roads near the campus to protest against a strike by their lecturers who were demanding better wages.
941	AFP_ENG_20070620.0309.LDC2009T13	On Monday, at Zambia's second largest university, riot policemen fired tear gas and arrested dozens of students for staging violent protests against a delay in allowance payments, the police said.
942	AFP_ENG_20070620.0309.LDC2009T13	Thirty students were detained at the Copperbelt university for their role in the protest in which property at the campus was destroyed and items were stolen, police spokesman Mhakeni Zulu said.

945	AFP_ENG_20070625.0645.LDC2009T13	The latest movie on the world's most famous wizard, "Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," hits the screen here Thursday, just weeks before fans will at last learn his final fate.
946	AFP_ENG_20070625.0645.LDC2009T13	The modest, bespectacled wizard has charmed a wide range of Muggles -- nonmagical humans -- from children avid to join Harry's Dumbledore's Army to Guantanamo Bay inmates who are reportedly entranced with the Potter series.
947	AFP_ENG_20070625.0645.LDC2009T13	British writer J.K. Rowling's six Harry Potter books have sold 325 million copies worldwide and have been translated into 64 languages, with the series converted into a successful film franchise starring Daniel Radcliffe.
948	AFP_ENG_20070625.0645.LDC2009T13	The earnestly awaited seventh and final book, "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows," is to be released on July 21, with Rowling warning she will kill off two characters.
949	AFP_ENG_20070625.0645.LDC2009T13	But on the screen, fans' worries about Harry's fate will be delayed for the time being as "Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," the fifth installment, opens in Tokyo in a world premiere on Thursday.
950	AFP_ENG_20070625.0645.LDC2009T13	The huge 150 million-dollar production follows Harry and his classmates at the Hogwarts school -- such as Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger -- as they face the evil Lord Voldemort who has come back from the darkness.
951	AFP_ENG_20070625.0645.LDC2009T13	The latest film on Harry, literally the golden boy of Warner Brothers Entertainment, is the first to be directed by David Yates.
952	AFP_ENG_20070625.0645.LDC2009T13	Yates, who has built the career with television dramas like "Sex Traffic," said he was challenged to depict the boy wizard who was now 15 and struggling with his inner self and ego.
953	AFP_ENG_20070625.0645.LDC2009T13	"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix" is "more complicated and complex than the earlier films," Yates told Japan's Fuji Television Network.
954	AFP_ENG_20070625.0645.LDC2009T13	"The key things of this movie are really about identity, about discovering who you are as a person, at that very difficult and often dramatic age between about 14 and 17," Yates said.
955	AFP_ENG_20070625.0645.LDC2009T13	"So it kind of opens the movies up to a bigger, older audience in a way, I think," he said.
956	AFP_ENG_20070625.0645.LDC2009T13	Harry also experiences his first romance in the fifth installment, a highlight of the upcoming film especially for those who have watched the life of the poor boy, whose parents were killed by Voldemort and was adopted by his mean aunt and uncle.
957	AFP_ENG_20070625.0645.LDC2009T13	"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix" will come with a major promotional campaign, with Harry's alter ego Radcliffe and producer David Heyman coming to Japan for the gala premiere.
958	AFP_ENG_20070625.0645.LDC2009T13	The film will hit cinemas around the world starting on July 11.
959	AFP_ENG_20070625.0645.LDC2009T13	It will not go into general release in Japan until July 20.
960	AFP_ENG_20070625.0645.LDC2009T13	It is the latest Hollywood film to have its world premiere in Japan, with "Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End" starring Johnny Depp also opening here before other countries.

972	AFP_ENG_20070702.0033.LDC2009T13	Kartakusuma told AFP that currently police action in suspected environmental crimes, such as industrial waste dumping or burning rubbish, was slow due to a tangle of bureaucracy officers are forced to navigate.

993	AFP_ENG_20070703.0537.LDC2009T13	"It is my hope that by working together for change in a spirit that takes us beyond parties and beyond partisanship we can agree a new British constitutional settlement that entrusts more power to parliament and to the British people," he said, in his first statement to parliament as prime minister.
994	AFP_ENG_20070703.0537.LDC2009T13	Brown spoke of a "route map" to make those in power more accountable and to uphold and enhance the rights and responsibilities of the citizen in a move to counter opposition claims he is a "top-down" centraliser.
995	AFP_ENG_20070703.0537.LDC2009T13	Chief among the so-called "royal prerogatives" he wishes to renounce is the power to declare war without parliamentary consent, although lawmakers were allowed a vote on military action in Iraq in 2003.
996	AFP_ENG_20070703.0537.LDC2009T13	"For centuries they (the prime minister and executive) have exercised authority in the name of the monarchy without the people and their elected representatives being consulted," Brown told parliament.
997	AFP_ENG_20070703.0537.LDC2009T13	Such authority had "no place in a modern democracy", he said, and by transferring the powers to parliament, it would make a "more open 21st century British democracy which better serves the British people".
998	AFP_ENG_20070703.0537.LDC2009T13	"The government will now consult on a resolution to guarantee that on the the grave issue of peace and war it is ultimately this House of Commons which will make the decision," he said.
999	AFP_ENG_20070703.0537.LDC2009T13	Brown also proposed greater transparency in the intelligence services, with the creation of a new National Security Council bringing together domestic and overseas security with development and community relations.
1000	AFP_ENG_20070703.0537.LDC2009T13	To do so would send out a "clear message" that at all times Britain "will be vigilant and we will never yield to addressing the terrorist threat", he added.
1001	AFP_ENG_20070703.0537.LDC2009T13	It would also help "co-ordinate military, policing, intelligence and diplomatic action and also to win hearts and minds in this country and round the world".
1002	AFP_ENG_20070703.0537.LDC2009T13	But it was his proposal for a British bill of rights -- codifying people's existing entitlements -- and/or a written constitution for the first time in the country's history that is likely to generate the most debate.
1003	AFP_ENG_20070703.0537.LDC2009T13	Unlike other countries, Britain's constitution as it stands is an uncodified body of law and largely consists of written legal precedents, international treaties, parliamentary conventions and royal prerogatives.
1004	AFP_ENG_20070703.0537.LDC2009T13	Brown, who is keen to promote individual responsibility and a sense of British identity, said the starting point should be the country's shared values.
1005	AFP_ENG_20070703.0537.LDC2009T13	"There is a case that we should go further still than this statement of values to codify, either in concordat or in a single document, both the duties and rights of citizens and the balance of power between government, parliament and the people," he explained.
1006	AFP_ENG_20070703.0537.LDC2009T13	"In Britain we have a largely unwritten constitution.
1007	AFP_ENG_20070703.0537.LDC2009T13	To change this would represent a fundamental and historic shift in our constitutional arrangement.
1008	AFP_ENG_20070703.0537.LDC2009T13	"So it is right to involve the public in a sustained debate whether there is a case for the United Kingdom developing a full British bill of rights and duties or for moving towards a written constitution."
1009	AFP_ENG_20070703.0537.LDC2009T13	Brown outlined consultations would begin on all issues, but said moves towards a constitution would only happen when there was a "settled consensus" about whether it was wanted.

1011	AFP_ENG_20070704.0104.LDC2009T13	Russia has yet to respond formally to Britain's request five weeks ago to extradite the chief suspect in the London murder of ex-Russian agent Alexander Litvinenko, a British diplomat said Wednesday.
1012	AFP_ENG_20070704.0104.LDC2009T13	"In the last five weeks we have not received an official answer to the request" to extradite Andrei Lugovoi, news agency Interfax quoted British Ambassador to Russia Anthony Brenton as saying in an interview.
1013	AFP_ENG_20070704.0104.LDC2009T13	British prosecutors have charged Lugovoi, a former KGB agent turned businessman, with murdering Litvinenko last November using the radioactive isotope polonium-210.
1014	AFP_ENG_20070704.0104.LDC2009T13	The case has severely strained relations between the two countries.
1015	AFP_ENG_20070704.0104.LDC2009T13	Russia has said its constitution forbids extraditing Russian citizens to face justice abroad, while Britain maintains that previous agreements with Russia allow it.
1016	AFP_ENG_20070704.0104.LDC2009T13	Litvinenko was a former Russian intelligence agent and a fierce Kremlin critic, who received political asylum and citizenship in Britain.
1017	AFP_ENG_20070712.0229.LDC2009T13	Underwear's historic role... in Western learning
1018	AFP_ENG_20070712.0229.LDC2009T13	Underwear underpins the spread of Western culture, with discarded underpants ranking alongside the invention of printing in the spread of literacy, according to a medieval historian.
1019	AFP_ENG_20070712.0229.LDC2009T13	Delegates at the International Medieval Congress at the University of Leeds, northern England, were told that social migration from rural to urban areas in the 13th century brought with it changes in attire.
1020	AFP_ENG_20070712.0229.LDC2009T13	Whereas rough and ready peasants thought little of wearing nothing under their smocks, the practice became frowned upon in the burgeoning towns and cities, leading to a run on undergarments.
1021	AFP_ENG_20070712.0229.LDC2009T13	And when the underwear was worn out, it provided a steady supply of material used by papermakers to make books.
1022	AFP_ENG_20070712.0229.LDC2009T13	"The development of literacy was certainly helped by the introduction of paper, which was made from rags," Marco Mostert, of Utrecht University in the Netherlands and one of the conference organisers, said this week.
1023	AFP_ENG_20070712.0229.LDC2009T13	"These rags came from discarded clothes, which cost much less than the very expensive parchment which was previously used for books.
1024	AFP_ENG_20070712.0229.LDC2009T13	"In the 13th century, so it is thought, as more people moved into urban centres, the use of underwear increased -- which caused an increase in the number of rags available for paper-making."
1025	AFP_ENG_20070712.0229.LDC2009T13	The invention of the movable type printing press by Johannes Gutenberg in the mid-15th century is generally credited with spreading learning.
1026	AFP_ENG_20070712.0229.LDC2009T13	But Mostert said that although literacy did not become widespread until the 19th century, it was more common in the Middle Ages than many believe because of cheap paper made from rags.
1027	AFP_ENG_20070718.0019.LDC2009T13	US, other Paris Club creditors to give debt relief to Afghanistan
1028	AFP_ENG_20070718.0019.LDC2009T13	The United States and fellow Paris Club members Russia and Germany agreed Wednesday to provide additional debt relief of about one billion dollars to Afghanistan, the US Treasury Department said.
1029	AFP_ENG_20070718.0019.LDC2009T13	The debt relief comes under the terms of the enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative, the Treasury said in a statement.
1030	AFP_ENG_20070718.0019.LDC2009T13	The agreement permits Afghanistan to benefit from debt reduction under the HIPC initiative of 92 percent, which is worth approximately one billion dollars.
1031	AFP_ENG_20070718.0019.LDC2009T13	Under the HIPC framework, the three creditors will cancel 90 percent of the non- concessional debt payments Afghanistan would owe during its current IMF program, furthering the relief the three countries had agreed to provide at a Paris Club meeting in July 2006.
1032	AFP_ENG_20070718.0019.LDC2009T13	The United States will go beyond the HIPC framework and forgive 100 percent of all debt payments falling due, the Treasury said.
1033	AFP_ENG_20070718.0019.LDC2009T13	The debt relief follows a decision by the executive boards of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, "with strong US support," to declare earlier in July that Afghanistan had formally qualified for the HIPC initiative, the Treasury said.
1034	AFP_ENG_20070718.0019.LDC2009T13	"To achieve this, the Afghan government had to adhere to the terms of its IMF program as well as meet certain other requirements," it said.
1035	AFP_ENG_20070718.0019.LDC2009T13	All remaining debt will be forgiven by the United States, Russia and Germany once Afghanistan reaches the completion point of its HIPC program, bringing total debt relief for Afghanistan to more than 11 billion dollars, or more than 99 percent of its total debt, the department said.
1036	AFP_ENG_20070718.0019.LDC2009T13	At a meeting on July 19, 2006, the Paris Club, an informal group of creditor governments from major industrialized countries, agreed to write off 1.6 billion dollars of Afghanistan's public debt and reschedule 800 million dollars.
1037	AFP_ENG_20070718.0495.LDC2009T13	Broadcaster bids to halt Mbeki documentary
1038	AFP_ENG_20070718.0495.LDC2009T13	South Africa's public broadcaster SABC sought a court order Wednesday to prevent the screening of a documentary on President Thabo Mbeki that was commissioned and then canned by the corporation.
1039	AFP_ENG_20070718.0495.LDC2009T13	The documentary called "Unauthorised: Thabo Mbeki and the African country" was due to be shown in select cinemas later this month but the broadcaster has lodged an urgent interdict at the high court, arguing it retains the copyright to the programme which was made by the private Broad Daylight Productions.
1040	AFP_ENG_20070718.0495.LDC2009T13	"The documentary is our property and they do not have the right to show it to anybody," said SABC spokesman Kaizer Kganyago.
1041	AFP_ENG_20070718.0495.LDC2009T13	The broadcaster has twice postponed the screening of the documentary, which was originally due to be shown last year, on editorial grounds.
1042	AFP_ENG_20070718.0495.LDC2009T13	The opening sequence, which has been seen by AFP, shows former president Nelson Mandela warning Mbeki not to settle scores with opponents after the latter was elected unopposed as head of the ANC a decade ago.
1043	AFP_ENG_20070718.0495.LDC2009T13	Media rights groups have accused the SABC of self-censorship, an accusation denied by the broadcaster.
1044	AFP_ENG_20070718.0495.LDC2009T13	"We have said it last year and we say it again, that there has never been any pressure" from the presidency, Kganyago said on SABC radio.
1045	AFP_ENG_20070718.0495.LDC2009T13	Jane Duncan, of the South Africa-based Freedom of Expression Institute, said the SABC was stifling debate by seeking to halt the screenings.
1046	AFP_ENG_20070718.0495.LDC2009T13	"Preventing the public from seeing the documentary is not the answer, and a narrow approach towards copyright should not be used to prevent the free flow of debate about the documentary," said Duncan.
1047	AFP_ENG_20070719.0644.LDC2009T13	Anger mounts over Brazil's deadliest air crash
1048	AFP_ENG_20070719.0644.LDC2009T13	Rescuers on Thursday pulled charred bodies from the burned out wreckage of Brazil's deadliest air disaster, amid angry accusations that airport safety concerns had been ignored.
1049	AFP_ENG_20070719.0644.LDC2009T13	All 186 passengers and crew aboard the Airbus 320 were believed to have died in Tuesday's crash at Sao Paulo's Cagonhas airport, along with a number of people on the ground.
1050	AFP_ENG_20070719.0644.LDC2009T13	The Tam Airlines flight had careened off the slick runway upon landing in driving rain, skidded across a crowded avenue and slammed into a warehouse where it exploded in a fireball.
1051	AFP_ENG_20070719.0644.LDC2009T13	It was "a tragedy waiting to happen," said Cezar Britto, president of The Order of Lawyers of Brazil, echoing opposition and national media criticism of precarious conditions at the airport.
1052	AFP_ENG_20070719.0644.LDC2009T13	"What exploded in Cagonhas was not just the TAM airbus and almost 200 victims but the credibility of the Brazilian aviation system," Britto said.
1053	AFP_ENG_20070719.0644.LDC2009T13	Cagonhas is notorious for a runway some officials consider too short and which pilots say becomes slick when wet.
1054	AFP_ENG_20070719.0644.LDC2009T13	"The runway was as slippery as soap," an unnamed pilot told the O Globo daily, adding that authorities should not have allowed the plane to land at in such conditions.
1055	AFP_ENG_20070719.0644.LDC2009T13	By the early morning hours of Wednesday, rescuers said they had pulled 181 bodies from the twisted metal of the plane and surrounding warehouse rubble.
1056	AFP_ENG_20070719.0644.LDC2009T13	Three of the bodies were found inside the Tam Express building that was struck by the plane.
1057	AFP_ENG_20070719.0644.LDC2009T13	One of the aircraft's black boxes was recovered.
1058	AFP_ENG_20070719.0644.LDC2009T13	Five people were still listed as missing and eleven people were in hospital with injuries, four of them in a critical state, the rescuers said.
1059	AFP_ENG_20070719.0644.LDC2009T13	"There is no sign of survivors," TAM President Marco Antonio Bologna said at a news conference.
1060	AFP_ENG_20070719.0644.LDC2009T13	There have been a number of incidents of planes skidding off the tarmac at the airport, including one the day before Tuesday's crash.
1061	AFP_ENG_20070719.0644.LDC2009T13	The main runway had been resurfaced last month, but more work was scheduled for September to build grooves into the surface to allow for better water drainage.
1062	AFP_ENG_20070719.0644.LDC2009T13	"Control tower operators had warned the runway should be closed because it didn't have 'grooving,' but no one in the government wanted to hear about it," said Sergio Olivera, who heads the Federation of Air Controllers.
1063	AFP_ENG_20070719.0644.LDC2009T13	The Justice Ministry said it had ordered an investigation to establish whether the runway met technical and legal security standards.
1064	AFP_ENG_20070719.0644.LDC2009T13	Brazil's airway infrastructure came under fresh scrutiny after the September crash of a Gol airliner with 154 people on board in the Amazon jungle.
1065	AFP_ENG_20070719.0644.LDC2009T13	The plane had collided with a small jet in an incident blamed on a deficient air traffic control system.
1066	AFP_ENG_20070719.0644.LDC2009T13	President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva declared three days of national mourning as world leaders conveyed their condolences over Tuesday's crash.
1067	AFP_ENG_20070719.0644.LDC2009T13	The victims included two French nationals, an Argentine and a Peruvian.
1068	AFP_ENG_20070719.0644.LDC2009T13	Pope Benedict XVI expressed his sorrow, saying he prayed "for strength and comfort for the injured and for those affected by the tragedy."
1069	AFP_ENG_20070719.0644.LDC2009T13	France's Bureau of Investigation and Analysis (BEA) said it was sending two of its investigators and that its German counterpart, the BFU, was sending another two.

1071	AFP_ENG_20070719.0644.LDC2009T13	Located just a few kilometers from Sao Paulo's city center, Congonhas is Latin America's busiest airport, with an average of 630 daily landings and take-offs.
1072	AFP_ENG_20070719.0644.LDC2009T13	It is mainly used for flights from other parts of Brazil and South America.
1073	AFP_ENG_20070719.0644.LDC2009T13	In February, a local judge banned the use of the airport by Fokker 100, Boeing 737-800 and Boeing 737/700 jetliners, but the ruling was overturned by an appeals court.

1088	AFP_ENG_20070723.0270.LDC2009T13	Ignacio Polanco on Monday won unanimous boardroom backing to succeed his late father as chairman of Spanish publishing group Prisa, the group said.
1089	AFP_ENG_20070723.0270.LDC2009T13	"The board of Prisa group today unanimously approved Ignacio Polanco as chairman," a statement said.
1090	AFP_ENG_20070723.0270.LDC2009T13	Ignacio Polanco, 52, succeeds Jesus de Polanco, who died Saturday aged 77 after a battle with cancer.
1091	AFP_ENG_20070723.0270.LDC2009T13	Jesus de Polanco transformed a schoolbook publisher he founded in 1958 into Prisa, the largest media company in the Spanish- speaking world, in the process becoming one of Spain's richest men.
1092	AFP_ENG_20070723.0270.LDC2009T13	He was involved in setting up top-selling daily centre-left newspaper El Pais in 1976, a move helping to restore Spain's independent press following the 1975 death of dictator General Francisco Franco.
1093	AFP_ENG_20070723.0270.LDC2009T13	Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero said at the weekend that Polanco had played an important and courageous role in helping Spain return to democracy.

1133	AFP_ENG_20070809.0474.LDC2009T13	East Timor's president Jose Ramos-Horta said Thursday that this week's violence had recalled the nation's bloody independence vote, as the new government began its first day in office.
1134	AFP_ENG_20070809.0474.LDC2009T13	Unrest surrounding East Timor's vote to break away from Indonesia in 1999 led to the deaths of some 1,400 people and saw militias allegedly backed by Indonesia's military lay waste to much of the tiny nation.
1135	AFP_ENG_20070809.0474.LDC2009T13	Violence that erupted in Dili and several other towns on Monday following the announcement of a new government headed by independence hero Xanana Gusmao has not led to any deaths but tensions have been running high.
1136	AFP_ENG_20070809.0474.LDC2009T13	"The violence against state property, civilians and the church reminded us of the brutal actions of the militias in 1999," Ramos-Horta, a Nobel peace laureate, said in a speech to lawmakers.
1137	AFP_ENG_20070809.0474.LDC2009T13	At least eight people, including four UN police, have been injured in the mayhem, which has seen marauding gangs torch buildings, pelt rocks at bystanders and set up threatening road blocks.

1147	AFP_ENG_20070812.5001.LDC2009T13	The next edition of the tournament, held every two years, will take place in Ghana in January 2008 and is the top prize in African football.

1184	AFP_ENG_20070821.0266.LDC2009T13	An alleged member of the political arm of the Basque independentist armed group ETA was arrested Tuesday in the southwestern French city of Bayonne, a source close to the case said.
1185	AFP_ENG_20070821.0266.LDC2009T13	French anti-terrorism police arrested 39-year-old Juliano Cavaterra, a member of the Batasuna pro-independence party, at his home and a search was underway.

1198	AFP_ENG_20070822.0132.LDC2009T13	Infectious diseases are emerging faster than at any time in history, the World Health Organisation (WHO) warned in a report on Thursday that urged closer global cooperation to tackle the growing health threats of the 21st century.
1199	AFP_ENG_20070822.0132.LDC2009T13	The WHO underlined that the threats knew no boundaries and included not only epidemics, but also foodborne diseases, chemical, biological or nuclear accidents or attacks, industrial pollution and the impact of climate change "that may put millions of people at risk in several countries".
1200	AFP_ENG_20070822.0132.LDC2009T13	"The report emphasises that the international response required today is not only to the known, but also to the unknown," the WHO said in its 2007 World Health Report "A Safer Future".
1201	AFP_ENG_20070822.0132.LDC2009T13	Open sharing of medical know-how, technology and supplies between rich and poor countries is also crucial, and "one of the most feasible routes to global health security," it added.
1202	AFP_ENG_20070822.0132.LDC2009T13	Since the 1970s new diseases have been identified at the "unprecedented" rate of one or more per year, the report said.
1203	AFP_ENG_20070822.0132.LDC2009T13	Other centuries-old threats such as influenza, malaria and tuberculosis were also thriving due to a combination of biological mutations, rising resistance to antibiotics and weak health systems.
1204	AFP_ENG_20070822.0132.LDC2009T13	"Given today's universal vulnerability to these threats, better security calls for global solidarity," WHO Director General Margaret Chan said in a statement, calling it "a collective aspiration and a mutual responsibility."
1205	AFP_ENG_20070822.0132.LDC2009T13	The report is largely based on the notion that a given health threat is no longer easily confined within a country and can spread around the world swiftly, partly due to the expansion in passenger air travel over the past half century and to trade.
1206	AFP_ENG_20070822.0132.LDC2009T13	It warned of "serious gaps, particularly in health services in many countries," caused by poverty or a lack of investment, that severely weaken the global safety net.
1207	AFP_ENG_20070822.0132.LDC2009T13	Health and medical care are not only essential to help prevent or treat illness, they are also at the core of detecting outbreaks, new diseases, as well as bioweapon attacks, environmental health problems, in time, the report underlined.
1208	AFP_ENG_20070822.0132.LDC2009T13	"It would be extremely naive and complacent to assume that there will not be another disease like AIDS, another Ebola, another SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome), sooner or later."
1209	AFP_ENG_20070822.0132.LDC2009T13	The three historical advances that helped stifle diseases such as bubonic plague, cholera and smallpox -- quarantines, better sanitation and immunisation -- came about separately but became successes once they were applied internationally, the report argued.
1210	AFP_ENG_20070822.0132.LDC2009T13	The WHO introduced new International Health Regulations this year that are meant to sharpen the response of its 193 members to major health threats within their own borders or abroad.
1211	AFP_ENG_20070822.0132.LDC2009T13	It is also trying to resolve with Indonesian complaints about the availability of newly developed medicines in poor countries, which halted crucial bird flu virus sharing with foreign laboratories.
1212	AFP_ENG_20070822.0132.LDC2009T13	The sharing of tissue samples from human victims is needed to detect possible mutations in the deadly H5N1 bird flu virus -- one of the biggest fears of the beginning of this century -- that might lead to a flu pandemic.

1214	AFP_ENG_20070822.0298.LDC2009T13	Russia on Wednesday gatecrashed an EU monopoly on choosing the head of the IMF by nominating a former Czech prime minister and challenging the European Union to allow fair competition for the post.
1215	AFP_ENG_20070822.0298.LDC2009T13	In a surprise statement, Moscow announced it was nominating former Czech premier and ex-central bank chief Josef Tosovsky to stand against the EU's candidate, former French finance minister Dominique Strauss-Kahn.
1216	AFP_ENG_20070822.0298.LDC2009T13	The Russian finance ministry said that countries from the developing world, including Brazil, China and India, wanted the head the International Monetary Fund to be chosen "on a competitive basis."
1217	AFP_ENG_20070822.0298.LDC2009T13	An unwritten agreement within the IMF -- an international lending organisation that specialises in aiding poor countries and developing economies -- stipulates that the European Union chooses new IMF heads.
1218	AFP_ENG_20070822.0298.LDC2009T13	The Czech government swiftly rebuffed Russia's initiative, saying that it stood behind Strauss-Kahn.
1219	AFP_ENG_20070822.0298.LDC2009T13	At a briefing in Moscow, Russian Finance Minister Alexei Kudrin said Prague's opposition was due to "political motives."
1220	AFP_ENG_20070822.0298.LDC2009T13	The World Bank, another international lending institution based in Washington, is traditionally headed by a candidate from the United States.
1221	AFP_ENG_20070822.0298.LDC2009T13	But Kudrin told journalists that countries outside the West must have a say.
1222	AFP_ENG_20070822.0298.LDC2009T13	"As soon as the election process started, it quickly became clear that the unwritten rule about the EU candidate would be used.
1223	AFP_ENG_20070822.0298.LDC2009T13	Not everyone agrees with this," Kudrin said.
1224	AFP_ENG_20070822.0298.LDC2009T13	"It's unfair to leading countries in the world ... The choice should be made in a professional way."
1225	AFP_ENG_20070822.0298.LDC2009T13	Kudrin said the major emerging economies of Brazil, China and India backed this view.
1226	AFP_ENG_20070822.0298.LDC2009T13	Moscow's challenge reflects a drive to reestablish Russian diplomatic, financial and military influence worldwide on the back of massive revenues for the world's biggest energy producer, analysts said.
1227	AFP_ENG_20070822.0298.LDC2009T13	Russian President Vladimir Putin earlier this year called for a revolution in world economic relations, saying international institutions created by the West were "archaic, undemocratic and inflexible."
1228	AFP_ENG_20070822.0298.LDC2009T13	"There is a sort of recognition amongst the larger emerging markets that they should have more say on what happens in international financial institutions," said Roland Nash, chief economist at Renaissance Capital.
1229	AFP_ENG_20070822.0298.LDC2009T13	"If you look at the producers and consumers of raw materials, those emerging markets now dominate.

1233	AFP_ENG_20070822.0298.LDC2009T13	The IMF has said it will accept applications for the post until August 31, and the executive board will then consider the candidates in September.

1235	AFP_ENG_20070822.0298.LDC2009T13	After the nomination of Strauss-Kahn, the IMF issued a statement saying the leadership contest was open to any national of the Fund's 185 member countries in a clear attempt to show the openness of the selection process.
1236	AFP_ENG_20070822.0298.LDC2009T13	A spokesman for the French foreign ministry said that Strauss- Kahn had support from "a very large number" of countries, including many African nations as well as China.

1247	AFP_ENG_20070826.0202.LDC2009T13	French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner called for Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki to be replaced and said the US government had utterly failed to understand the country's ancient rivalries.
1248	AFP_ENG_20070826.0202.LDC2009T13	"I just had (US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice) on the phone 10 or 15 minutes ago, and I told her, 'Listen, he's got to be replaced,'" Kouchner told the US magazine Newsweek, in an interview published Sunday following his August 19-21 trip to Baghdad.
1249	AFP_ENG_20070826.0202.LDC2009T13	"Many people believe the prime minister ought to be changed.
1250	AFP_ENG_20070826.0202.LDC2009T13	I don't know if that will go through, though, because it seems President (George W.) Bush is attached to Mr Maliki.

1252	AFP_ENG_20070826.0202.LDC2009T13	In Baghdad, Maliki called for an official French apology for Kouchner's remarks.

1256	AFP_ENG_20070826.0202.LDC2009T13	In Paris, a foreign ministry spokesman sought to downplay the remarks, with a spokesman saying that Kouchner was merely conveying views that he had heard during his visit to Baghdad.

1331	AFP_ENG_20070906.0363.LDC2009T13	WTO chief Lamy doubts trans-Pacific free trade zone
1332	AFP_ENG_20070906.0363.LDC2009T13	World Trade Organisation chief Pascal Lamy said Thursday a proposed Asia-Pacific wide free trade zone would be hard to achieve because of the wide diversity of the region's economies.
1333	AFP_ENG_20070906.0363.LDC2009T13	The concept of a sprawling free trade area stretching from China to Chile was worth studying, Lamy said, but warned that negotiators are likely to face the same problems that are weighing down current global trade talks.
1334	AFP_ENG_20070906.0363.LDC2009T13	"I think it's a concept which is worth deepening, studying, chewing (and) discussing with various constituencies," he said, referring to a proposed Free Trade Area of the Asia Pacific (FTAAP).
1335	AFP_ENG_20070906.0363.LDC2009T13	But "whether the odds that it will happen are there, I don't think so," he told a business forum on the margins of the Asia- Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) meeting in Sydney.
1336	AFP_ENG_20070906.0363.LDC2009T13	Many of the executives at Thursday's forum are members of an APEC business advisory council, which has voiced frustration at the WTO's floundering Doha Round of trade talks and supports efforts to find an alternative route to trade liberalisation.
1337	AFP_ENG_20070906.0363.LDC2009T13	Lamy insisted the multilateral trading system remained the best framework for freeing up world trade.
1338	AFP_ENG_20070906.0363.LDC2009T13	"Knowing a bit about the diversity and the variety of APEC countries, I think if an APEC free-trade zone was possible, then a WTO Doha deal is very easy," said Lamy.
1339	AFP_ENG_20070906.0363.LDC2009T13	Indonesian Trade Minister Mari Pangestu, who spoke in the same forum, voiced similar sentiments.
1340	AFP_ENG_20070906.0363.LDC2009T13	"If you are going to negotiate an FTAAP, you are going to face the same issues and sensitivities and complexities," she said.
1341	AFP_ENG_20070906.0363.LDC2009T13	"What makes us think that we can solve it under an FTAAP if we can't solve it under the WTO?
1342	AFP_ENG_20070906.0363.LDC2009T13	"In the short term, it is very difficult to see the prospects of an FTAAP, but it doesn't mean that we should not do anything about cooperation in the Asia- Pacific region."

1345	AFP_ENG_20070913.0040.LDC2009T13	US President George W. Bush on Thursday embraced a limited troop draw-down from Iraq by mid-2008, but rejected calls for a full withdrawal and said his successor would inherit a US presence there.
1346	AFP_ENG_20070913.0040.LDC2009T13	"Because of the measure of success we are seeing in Iraq, we can begin seeing troops come home," he said in the prepared text of a prime-time speech.
1347	AFP_ENG_20070913.0040.LDC2009T13	"The more successful we are, the more American troops can return home."
1348	AFP_ENG_20070913.0040.LDC2009T13	Bush indicated that he had accepted advice from the US commander in Iraq, General David Petraeus, that would bring some 5,700 troops home by Christmas and a total of 21,500 combat troops out by mid-2008.
1349	AFP_ENG_20070913.0040.LDC2009T13	The US president's would leave about 130,000 troops in Iraq, roughly the number in December 2006, one month before he escalated US force levels in a thus-far failed effort to give Iraq's leaders room to reach key compromises.
1350	AFP_ENG_20070913.0040.LDC2009T13	With most public opinion polls showing the US public two-to-one opposed to his strategy, and his Democratic foes clamoring for a withdrawal, Bush defiantly said he would build "an enduring relationship" with Iraq.
1351	AFP_ENG_20070913.0040.LDC2009T13	Iraqi leaders "understand that their success will require US political, economic, and security engagement that extends beyond my presidency," said Bush, whose term ends in January 2009.
1352	AFP_ENG_20070913.0040.LDC2009T13	"These Iraqi leaders have asked for an enduring relationship with America.
1353	AFP_ENG_20070913.0040.LDC2009T13	And we are ready to begin building that relationship in a way that protects our interests in the region and requires many fewer American troops," he said.
1354	AFP_ENG_20070913.0040.LDC2009T13	Bush also bluntly acknowledged he was not satisfied with the pace of Iraqi political reforms that Washington views as critical to forging national unity and quelling sectarian violence and urged leaders in Baghdad to do more.
1355	AFP_ENG_20070913.0040.LDC2009T13	"The government has not met its own legislative benchmarks, and in my meetings with Iraqi leaders, I have made it clear that they must," said Bush, who was to speak at 9 pm (0100 GMT Friday) from the Oval Office.
1356	AFP_ENG_20070913.0040.LDC2009T13	The president's plan came as the US Congress was poised to take up Democratic efforts to end the war and as presidential contenders faced tough questions on what they would do if elected in November 2008.

1358	AFP_ENG_20070913.0040.LDC2009T13	Democrats lack the votes to set a timetable for ending the war, but hope to secure Republican support to limit the US role in Iraq to battling terrorists, training the Iraqi army and protecting US personnel and installations.
1359	AFP_ENG_20070913.0040.LDC2009T13	They also hope to ensure that troops spend as much time at home as they do deployed in the war zone -- an apparent bid to limit the numbers of troops available for deployment.
1360	AFP_ENG_20070913.0040.LDC2009T13	The move came after two days of testimony by Petraeus and the US ambassador in Baghdad, Ryan Crocker, before the White House releases a progress report on the unpopular war on Friday.
1361	AFP_ENG_20070913.0040.LDC2009T13	Petraeus acknowledged in testimony to lawmakers that his draw- down reflected the end of the "surge" Bush ordered in January, but White House officials have couched it as the natural response to progress in Iraq.
1362	AFP_ENG_20070913.0040.LDC2009T13	"We've got a long way to go.
1363	AFP_ENG_20070913.0040.LDC2009T13	It's very hard.
1364	AFP_ENG_20070913.0040.LDC2009T13	We're realistic about it," Bush spokeswoman Dana Perino.
1365	AFP_ENG_20070913.0040.LDC2009T13	Perino also denounced as an "outrage" the bombing that killed a top Iraqi Sunni sheikh, Sattar Abu Reesha, who spearheaded a campaign against Al-Qaeda in his restive home province of Anbar.
1366	AFP_ENG_20070913.0040.LDC2009T13	Abu Reesha, in his 40s, was the leading figure in the Anbar Awakening Conference, a coalition of some 25 tribes that came together a year ago and pledged to fight Al-Qaeda militants by forming their own paramilitary units and supplying recruits to the local police.
1367	AFP_ENG_20070913.0040.LDC2009T13	Opinion polls suggest that the war-weary US public is largely in favor of a swift withdrawal from Iraq, where more than 3,700 US soldiers and tens of thousands of Iraqis have been killed since the March 2003 invasion.

1376	AFP_ENG_20070913.0634.LDC2009T13	Former Australian captain Ian Chappell said Ricky Ponting's side was complacent and lacked respect for its opposition Thursday after a shock loss to minnows Zimbabwe in the Twenty20 world cup.
1377	AFP_ENG_20070913.0634.LDC2009T13	Australia's World Cup and Test champions limped to 138 for nine in the opening match of their campaign in South Africa, only for Zimbabwe to overhaul the total with one ball to spare in a thrilling match.
1378	AFP_ENG_20070913.0634.LDC2009T13	Chappell, a gritty Australian captain in the 1970s who never lost a Test series as skipper, said the Ponting's side could not use a long lay-off from the game as an excuse.
1379	AFP_ENG_20070913.0634.LDC2009T13	"I think it's more likely the Australians were complacent than rusty," Chappell told the CricInfo website.
1380	AFP_ENG_20070913.0634.LDC2009T13	Chappell said the Australians had played plenty of practice matches in the lead- up to the tournament opener and Ponting would be disappointed his players did not treat their unfancied opponents with more respect.
1381	AFP_ENG_20070913.0634.LDC2009T13	"I think there could have been a feeling of 'all we've got to do is turn up and we'll beat Zimbabwe'," he said.
1382	AFP_ENG_20070913.0634.LDC2009T13	"I think that's what Ricky Ponting was alluding to when he said after the game that his players need to respect the (Twenty20) game a little."
1383	AFP_ENG_20070913.0634.LDC2009T13	Chappell said Ponting probably delivered a "tongue lashing" to his team after the loss.
1384	AFP_ENG_20070913.0634.LDC2009T13	He also warned Australia's next opponents, England, to expect a backlash.
1385	AFP_ENG_20070913.0634.LDC2009T13	"England will need to watch out when Australia play them because they'll be wounded," he said.
1386	AFP_ENG_20070913.0634.LDC2009T13	"On a minor scale, it will be a little bit like when Australia lost the Ashes to them in 2005."
1387	AFP_ENG_20070913.0634.LDC2009T13	Australia bounced back from that loss to thrash England 5-0 in the next Ashes Test series.
1388	AFP_ENG_20070913.0634.LDC2009T13	Australia's loss came too late to make the newspapers Down Under but their online editions blasted Ponting's men.
1389	AFP_ENG_20070913.0634.LDC2009T13	"Zimbabwe beats awful Australia," lamented Sydney's Daily Telegraph, while the Australian newspaper's website described the national team's performance as "embarrassing."
1390	AFP_ENG_20070913.0634.LDC2009T13	"Ostracised Zimbabwe stun Ponting's men," said the Sydney Morning Herald, pointing out that Australia were in real danger of crashing out of the tournament.
1391	AFP_ENG_20070913.0634.LDC2009T13	Cricket Australia's official website, cricket.com.au, described the loss as "one of cricket's great shocks."

1393	AFP_ENG_20070917.0048.LDC2009T13	Former Burundian prime minister Gabriel Mpozagara and his wife were sentenced Monday to between a year and 15 months in jail for keeping two of their nieces in slave-like conditions.
1394	AFP_ENG_20070917.0048.LDC2009T13	Mpozagara and his wife were each fined 10,000 euros (13,869 dollars) and ordered to pay 24,000 euros in damages and interest to the elder of the two nieces, their lawyer Patrick Caillet told AFP.
1395	AFP_ENG_20070917.0048.LDC2009T13	Caillet said the two young girls were kept in conditions resembling child slavery between 1994 and 1999 at the couples' plush home in the town of Ville d'Avray.
1396	AFP_ENG_20070917.0048.LDC2009T13	"They were kept in a cellar and lacked a proper toilet and were given just a little water to wash themselves," he said.
1397	AFP_ENG_20070917.0048.LDC2009T13	The elder niece "was the maid and had to work seven days a week, for between 16 and 17 hours daily, to attend to the tasks of the couple and their six children," said anti-slavery body CCEM, which took up the girls' case.
1398	AFP_ENG_20070917.0048.LDC2009T13	The two girls were brought to France in 1994 after the death of their parents in Burundi's civil war.
1399	AFP_ENG_20070917.0048.LDC2009T13	They were then aged nine and 13.

1402	AFP_ENG_20070918.0018.LDC2009T13	One of Denmark's national treasures, a set of two horns made in the 1800s, was recovered by police Tuesday after being stolen in the early hours of Monday, local television station TV2Syd reported.
1403	AFP_ENG_20070918.0018.LDC2009T13	Police inspector Steen Edeling told the station in the central town of Vejle that the horns had been found.
1404	AFP_ENG_20070918.0018.LDC2009T13	He did not give any details, but a press conference was to be held in Vejle at 0800 GMT Wednesday.
1405	AFP_ENG_20070918.0018.LDC2009T13	Called "Guldhornene" in Danish, or the Golden Horns, the pieces are silver replicas of two original gold horns made in 400 AD which were stolen in 1802 and destroyed.
1406	AFP_ENG_20070918.0018.LDC2009T13	The replicas, with a thin gold coating, were on loan from the National Museum of Denmark for an exhibit in Jelling, near the central Danish town of Vejle, when they were stolen by thieves who smashed a display case.
1407	AFP_ENG_20070918.0018.LDC2009T13	Even though the works are replicas they are part of the country's cultural heritage, National Museum curator Carsten Larsen said.
1408	AFP_ENG_20070918.0018.LDC2009T13	The originals were discovered in the town of Gallehus in southern Denmark in 1639 before they went missing and were found again in 1734.
1409	AFP_ENG_20070918.0018.LDC2009T13	They were stolen in 1802 from the Royal Chamber of Art by an indebted jeweller, Niels Heidenreich, who melted the gold to make jewellery and counterfeit coins.

1415	AFP_ENG_20070920.0737.LDC2009T13	The United States led a global chorus of outrage Wednesday at the slaying of an anti-Syrian Lebanese lawmaker in Beirut and warned Syria and Iran against trying to destabilize their smaller neighbor.
1416	AFP_ENG_20070920.0737.LDC2009T13	"I strongly condemn today's horrific assassination of Lebanese member of parliament Antoine Ghanem," said Bush, who cited "a tragic pattern" of attacks against champions of "an independent and democratic Lebanon."
1417	AFP_ENG_20070920.0737.LDC2009T13	"We will continue to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with the Lebanese people, as they resist attempts by the Syrian and Iranian regimes and their allies to destabilize Lebanon and undermine its sovereignty," he said in a statement.
1418	AFP_ENG_20070920.0737.LDC2009T13	Britain, France, Greece, Italy, Russia, Spain, Canada, the United Arab Emirates and the United Nations also denounced the car bombing, which plunged deeply divided Lebanon into further chaos days ahead of crucial elections.
1419	AFP_ENG_20070920.0737.LDC2009T13	The European Union condemned the killing as a "contemptible act," while urging the Lebanese government to go ahead with a hotly contested September 25 presidential contest.
1420	AFP_ENG_20070920.0737.LDC2009T13	Ghanem's murder was the latest in a string of attacks since October 2004 against prominent critics of Lebanon's neighbor and former powerbroker Syria, and his colleagues were quick to point the finger of blame at Damascus.
1421	AFP_ENG_20070920.0737.LDC2009T13	"Today's cowardly attack comes days before the Lebanese parliament is scheduled to convene to elect a new president," Bush said.
1422	AFP_ENG_20070920.0737.LDC2009T13	"There has been a tragic pattern of political assassinations and attempted assassinations designed to silence those Lebanese who courageously defend their vision of an independent and democratic Lebanon."
1423	AFP_ENG_20070920.0737.LDC2009T13	The United States opposes any attempts to intimidate the Lebanese people as they seek to exercise their democratic right to select a president without foreign interference," he said.
1424	AFP_ENG_20070920.0737.LDC2009T13	Syria denied any involvement, saying the bombing was a "criminal act" aimed at undermining efforts at a rapprochement with Lebanon, while Beirut launched its own investigation.
1425	AFP_ENG_20070920.0737.LDC2009T13	Lebanese Prime Minister Fuad Siniora also urged UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon to open an international probe into the bombing, which left five others dead and wounded more than 50 in a Christian neighborhood of Beirut.
1426	AFP_ENG_20070920.0737.LDC2009T13	Bush said the international community had to support "efforts to bring to justice the perpetrators of these violent attacks, and to stand with the citizens of Lebanon who continue to struggle to protect their freedom."
1427	AFP_ENG_20070920.0737.LDC2009T13	Asked whether Damascus was involved, White House spokeswoman Dana Perino said she was "not prepared to assign blame" but insisted "there's been a pattern and this would seem to fit into the pattern."
1428	AFP_ENG_20070920.0737.LDC2009T13	US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said the bombing was "another act in a campaign of terror by those who want to turn back the clock on Lebanon's hard won democratic gains."
1429	AFP_ENG_20070920.0737.LDC2009T13	"Enemies of peace and freedom want to gain through violence, threat and intimidation what they cannot win in free and fair elections," she said in a statement.
1430	AFP_ENG_20070920.0737.LDC2009T13	"The world should speak with one voice in calling for an end to violence in Lebanon intended to subvert democratic processes in that country."
1431	AFP_ENG_20070920.0737.LDC2009T13	British Foreign Secretary David Miliband condemned what he called a "ruthless attempt to destabilize Lebanon" before critical September 5 elections to pick a successor to Syria-backed President Emile Lahoud.
1432	AFP_ENG_20070920.0737.LDC2009T13	French President Nicolas Sarkozy expressed personal "sadness and anger" at what he described as a "targeted attack."
1433	AFP_ENG_20070920.0737.LDC2009T13	"All light must be shed on the circumstances of this heinous crime and its perpetrators must be brought to justice," said Sarkozy, who, like Washington, linked it to other high-profile assassinations of anti-Syrian Lebanese leaders.
1434	AFP_ENG_20070920.0737.LDC2009T13	France and the United States have led international efforts to curb Syrian influence in Lebanon.
1435	AFP_ENG_20070920.0737.LDC2009T13	Russia said "the organizers and perpetrators must be found and punished" while Italy denounced the bombing as a "terrorist attack" aimed at "destabilizing Lebanese political life at a particularly delicate time."
1436	AFP_ENG_20070920.0737.LDC2009T13	Canada said it stood "firmly" by Siniora and called the bombing an "attack on Lebanon’s independence, stability and democracy, especially in view of the upcoming elections."
1437	AFP_ENG_20070920.0737.LDC2009T13	"I urge the people of Lebanon to continue to resist those who seek to destabilize their country and to pursue their efforts to find a political solution to the current crisis," Foriegn Minister Maxime Bernier said.
1438	AFP_ENG_20070920.0737.LDC2009T13	Ghanem, a member of the Phalange party of former president Amin Gemayel, was the eighth member of the ruling anti-Syrian majority to be assassinated since the 2005 murder of former billionaire prime minister Rafiq Hariri.

1441	AFP_ENG_20070922.0273.LDC2009T13	Liam Miller snatched a point for Sunderland as Middlesbrough were made to pay for failing to make more of the chances they generated in an entertaining northeast derby clash.
1442	AFP_ENG_20070922.0273.LDC2009T13	Former Celtic and Manchester United midfielder Miller latched on to a Kenwyne Jones header to volley in an equaliser a minute from time after Boro had battled back from conceding an early goal to lead through Stewart Downing's superb strike.
1443	AFP_ENG_20070922.0273.LDC2009T13	Sunderland need just over a minute to take the lead, Grant Leadbitter capitalising after former Black Cats midfielder Julio Arca carelessly conceded possession on the half-way line.
1444	AFP_ENG_20070922.0273.LDC2009T13	Midfielder Leadbitter surged forward and fed Michael Chopra before continuing his run to collect the forward's drive into the box, steady himself and slot the ball past Mark Schwarzer in the Boro goal.
1445	AFP_ENG_20070922.0273.LDC2009T13	The shock of going behind so early in the contest appeared to galvanise Boro and their offensive efforts were rewarded after quarter of an hour when Arca made amends for his earlier error by equalising.
1446	AFP_ENG_20070922.0273.LDC2009T13	Debutant Gary O'Neil floated in a cross from the right and the Argentinian rose to met it with an emphatic header that left Sunderland's Scotland goalkeeper Craig Gordon with no chance.
1447	AFP_ENG_20070922.0273.LDC2009T13	That proved to be Arca's last significant contribution to the contest as he was stretchered off shortly afterwards.
1448	AFP_ENG_20070922.0273.LDC2009T13	Boro had already lost Turkish striker Tuncay Sanli to injury but they nevertheless continued to pose the greater attacking threat.
1449	AFP_ENG_20070922.0273.LDC2009T13	Fabio Rochemback struck a shot inches wide with Gordon apparently beaten and referee Howard Webb enraged the home supporters when he failed to point to the spot after Danny Higginbotham apparently handled Luke Young's ball into the box.
1450	AFP_ENG_20070922.0273.LDC2009T13	O'Neil then had a chance to mark his debut with a goal but he volleyed over the bar from close range after Downing's shot had been deflected into his path.
1451	AFP_ENG_20070922.0273.LDC2009T13	Boro finally took the lead in the 66th minute, Downing cutting in from the left before striking a superb shot with his right from outside the area.
1452	AFP_ENG_20070922.0273.LDC2009T13	That looked virtually certain to wrap up the points for the home side but Miller had other ideas.

1457	AFP_ENG_20071004.0237.LDC2009T13	Poland's president postponed on Thursday memorial events marking the Soviet massacre of soldiers in 1940 after concerns that politicians could exploit them in the country's election campaign.
1458	AFP_ENG_20071004.0237.LDC2009T13	Events in honour of 22,500 Polish prisoners of war slain by the Soviet secret police in the notorious Katyn forest and other sites had been set to begin on Friday, less than three weeks before parliamentary elections on October 21.
1459	AFP_ENG_20071004.0237.LDC2009T13	They will now take place on November 11, which is also Poland's independence day, said Ewa Junczyk-Ziomecka, a top aide to President Lech Kaczynski.
1460	AFP_ENG_20071004.0237.LDC2009T13	Polish film director Andrzej Wajda, whose father was killed in the massacres and who has just released a film about it called simply "Katyn", called for a postponement in a letter in the daily Gazeta Wyborcza on Thursday.
1461	AFP_ENG_20071004.0237.LDC2009T13	Wajda, 81, said he was speaking out after learning that Katyn victims including his father, Captain Jakub Wajda, were to receive posthumous promotions.
1462	AFP_ENG_20071004.0237.LDC2009T13	"This promotion will be taking place during an electoral battle.
1463	AFP_ENG_20071004.0237.LDC2009T13	I don't want the death of my father, and the deaths of the thousands of Polish officers exterminated in the Soviet Union, to be exploited," Wajda said.
1464	AFP_ENG_20071004.0237.LDC2009T13	Earlier Thursday, Prime Minister Jaroslaw Kaczynski, the president's identical twin, had ruled out a postponement.
1465	AFP_ENG_20071004.0237.LDC2009T13	The Kaczynskis and their ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party have regularly played the nationalist, anti-communist card against Poland's liberal and left- wing opposition parties since coming to power in 2005.
1466	AFP_ENG_20071004.0237.LDC2009T13	Lech Kaczynski decided to act because he believed the "presidency's motives have been misinterpreted," Junczyk-Ziomecka said.
1467	AFP_ENG_20071004.0237.LDC2009T13	"The ceremonies have been bundled with the election campaign," she said.
1468	AFP_ENG_20071004.0237.LDC2009T13	"President Kaczynski will not allow the victims and their families to be treated like this," she added.
1469	AFP_ENG_20071004.0237.LDC2009T13	The Katyn massacre came in the wake of Moscow's deal with Nazi Germany to invade and carve up Poland in 1939.
1470	AFP_ENG_20071004.0237.LDC2009T13	The Polish officers captured by the Red Army were deemed anti- communist "counterrevolutionaries" and picked out to be killed by the Soviet NKVD secret police.
1471	AFP_ENG_20071004.0237.LDC2009T13	The episode remained obscured for a long time, even when the Nazis revealed the existence of the mass graves which they discovered in 1941 after they invaded the Soviet Union.
1472	AFP_ENG_20071004.0237.LDC2009T13	Moscow blamed the Germans for the massacre, and the West remained silent so as not to antagonise the Soviet Union, then a valuable ally in the fight against Hitler.
1473	AFP_ENG_20071004.0237.LDC2009T13	The subject remained taboo under Poland's post-war communist regime.
1474	AFP_ENG_20071004.0237.LDC2009T13	It was only in 1990 that then Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev admitted his country's responsibility.

1477	AFP_ENG_20071005.0130.LDC2009T13	The United States on Friday proposed a common network of missile defense systems with Russia and NATO to allay Moscow's concerns over a planned US missile defence system in central Europe.
1478	AFP_ENG_20071005.0130.LDC2009T13	"The answer is we and the Russians and NATO or the NATO-Russia Council work together to produce a common system or common network of systems which would benefit everyone's security and also address Russian security concerns," Assistant Secretary of State Daniel Fried said.
1479	AFP_ENG_20071005.0130.LDC2009T13	"If they are part of the system, they can be much more confident that it is not directed against them," he said, speaking ahead of talks next week between US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and Defense Secretary Robert Gates with their opposite numbers in Moscow on October 12.
1480	AFP_ENG_20071005.0130.LDC2009T13	They will meet Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Defense Secretary Anatoly Serdyukov in the wake of stalled negotiations earlier this month between the two sides in Paris on America's planned missile defense system.
1481	AFP_ENG_20071005.0130.LDC2009T13	The proposed system in central Europe is a source of long-running friction between the two former Cold War enemies.
1482	AFP_ENG_20071005.0130.LDC2009T13	Washington claims the system would protect against "rogue states" such as Iran and wants to build a radar tracking base in the Czech Republic and house interceptor missiles in Poland.
1483	AFP_ENG_20071005.0130.LDC2009T13	Moscow has said the system would create a "new Berlin wall," and President Vladimir Putin has suggested siting it in Azerbaijan instead.
1484	AFP_ENG_20071005.0130.LDC2009T13	Kremlin also threatened to re-deploy nuclear missiles if the US forges ahead with the project.
1485	AFP_ENG_20071005.0130.LDC2009T13	Fried, who is in charge of for European and Eurasian Affairs in the State Department, said Russian plans to share the Gabar radar station in Azerbaijan or a radar site in southern Russia opened up a possibility of having "genuinely collaborative efforts on missile defense directed at common problems.
1486	AFP_ENG_20071005.0130.LDC2009T13	"We would like to see the whole question opened up as it were with everything on the table -- what NATO is doing, what US, Poles and Czechs may be doing, what Russia is prepared to offer.
1487	AFP_ENG_20071005.0130.LDC2009T13	"So, this is a very far reaching proposal by the Russians which I hope would have some very good potential areas of cooperation," he said.

1518	AFP_ENG_20071104.0132.LDC2009T13	The win in Paris hoists him to ninth in the ATP Masters Series race, but only eight players qualify.
1519	AFP_ENG_20071104.0132.LDC2009T13	"I played magnificently all week and in Madrid and I am so happy," said Nalbandian, who has hit a rich vein of form in recent weeks after what had been for him a disappointing season.

1525	AFP_ENG_20071105.0457.LDC2009T13	Aerospace group EADS sustained a fresh body blow Monday, warning that delays to its new military aircraft will cost up to 2.0 billion dollars as it grapples with an insider trading scandal and costly setbacks to its flagship A380 superjumbo.
1526	AFP_ENG_20071105.0457.LDC2009T13	The news sparked a heavy sell-off in EADS shares in early trading here as the group disclosed that it would now have to reconsider its operating profit projections for 2007 when it announces quarterly results November 8.
1527	AFP_ENG_20071105.0457.LDC2009T13	Shares in EADS, which controls European aircraft manufacturer Airbus, fell 4.19 percent to 21.93 euros on an overall Paris market that was 0.66 percent weaker.
1528	AFP_ENG_20071105.0457.LDC2009T13	EADS, the European Aeronautic Defence and Space Company, said delays of at least six months in deliveries of the Airbus A400M military transporter would cost it between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros.
1529	AFP_ENG_20071105.0457.LDC2009T13	"While the calculations have not been finalised, EADS currently estimates it will have to spend between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros, of which more than one billion for Airbus," the group said in a statement.
1530	AFP_ENG_20071105.0457.LDC2009T13	EADS said on October 17 that delivery of the A400Ms to the French airforce would be moved back six months to 2010 because of engine problems.
1531	AFP_ENG_20071105.0457.LDC2009T13	But it also warned at the time of an "additional risk of a further slippage of six months."
1532	AFP_ENG_20071105.0457.LDC2009T13	"The problems with the A400M programme show that EADS has still to demonstrate that it can overcome and improve a defective execution strategy," said analyst Harald Liberge-Dondoux of the bank Credit Mutuel CIC.
1533	AFP_ENG_20071105.0457.LDC2009T13	Revelations last month of new difficulties with the A400M dampened some of the euphoria that had surrounded the delivery two days earlier of the first A380, the world's largest civilian aircraft, to Singapore Airlines.
1534	AFP_ENG_20071105.0457.LDC2009T13	The handover was 18 months behind schedule as the A380 has been bedeviled by production problems dating back to March 2006, which sparked a 93 percent slide in first half profit at EADS this year to 71 million euros.
1535	AFP_ENG_20071105.0457.LDC2009T13	Scrambling to repair the damage, EADS and Airbus devised a controversial restructuring plan that would slash thousands of jobs at Airbus production sites, principally in France and Germany, and in July carried out a sweeping management shakeup.
1536	AFP_ENG_20071105.0457.LDC2009T13	EADS scrapped a cumbersome dual Franco-German management structure, giving the sole executive job at EADS to Louis Gallois of France while making Thomas Enders, a German, the top man at Airbus.
1537	AFP_ENG_20071105.0457.LDC2009T13	Then in early October this year EADS was rocked anew by a press report that the French stock market regulator had prepared a document naming around 20 top EADS executives and shareholders alleged to have engaged in insider trading.
1538	AFP_ENG_20071105.0457.LDC2009T13	A Paris judge is currently looking into accusations that management and shareholders sold their shares in the group just before the problems with the A380 were publicly disclosed in June 2006, prompting a 26 percent plunge in the EADS shareprice.
1539	AFP_ENG_20071105.0457.LDC2009T13	Several of those suspected of insider trading have denied any wrongdoing while the French government, which has a 15 percent stake in EADS, has insisted its conduct in the matter has been "beyond reproach."
1540	AFP_ENG_20071105.0457.LDC2009T13	In its statement Monday EADS said the announced costs connected with the A400M would not cover any new difficulties that arise with the programme.
1541	AFP_ENG_20071105.0457.LDC2009T13	The aircraft is Europe's response to the ageing C-130 Hercules transporter, produced by the US firm Lockheed.
1542	AFP_ENG_20071105.0457.LDC2009T13	EADS has said it will have greater airlift capacity and range than both the Hercules and the Transall, another ageing but widely used military transport plane.
1543	AFP_ENG_20071105.0457.LDC2009T13	The A400M, the most important military industrial programme ever carried out between European partners, was launched by seven countries in May 2003.

1545	AFP_ENG_20071106.0037.LDC2009T13	US starts reviewing aid to Pakistan
1546	AFP_ENG_20071106.0037.LDC2009T13	The United States said Tuesday it has begun studying whether to suspend any of its multi-billion-dollar aid program to Pakistan as it again pressed President Pervez Musharraf to end emergency rule.
1547	AFP_ENG_20071106.0037.LDC2009T13	"People started work on it," State Department spokesman Sean McCormack told reporters, referring to the review that had been promised since Musharraf declared emergency rule in his country on Saturday.
1548	AFP_ENG_20071106.0037.LDC2009T13	The review involving the State Department and other government agencies as well as the White House would look at whether Pakistan had violated any US laws or rules that would require Washington to suspend aid, he said.
1549	AFP_ENG_20071106.0037.LDC2009T13	US officials said Washington has contributed 9.6 billion dollars in military and economic development aid to Pakistan since it became a key US ally in the US war against terrorism following the attacks on September 11, 2001.
1550	AFP_ENG_20071106.0037.LDC2009T13	Another 780 million dollars is due this year.
1551	AFP_ENG_20071106.0037.LDC2009T13	McCormack said the US government had to weigh its legal obligations against ensuring that it continued to bolster Pakistan in its battles against Islamist militants hiding along its border with Afghanistan.
1552	AFP_ENG_20071106.0037.LDC2009T13	"I don't think anybody expects that the president or the government is going to take a step that might make the United States less safe or might diminish our capabilities to fight terror," McCormack said.
1553	AFP_ENG_20071106.0037.LDC2009T13	"That said, there are potentially certain requirements under the law.
1554	AFP_ENG_20071106.0037.LDC2009T13	We're going to look at what is required and what is triggered by the law," he said.
1555	AFP_ENG_20071106.0037.LDC2009T13	McCormack said the US aim was to press nuclear-armed Pakistan to resume its path toward democracy in the interest of Pakistanis, their neighbors and the world at large.
1556	AFP_ENG_20071106.0037.LDC2009T13	He added that "robust democratic institutions" will in the long term "be Pakistan's best defense against the violent extremists..."
1557	AFP_ENG_20071106.0037.LDC2009T13	The White House meanwhile expressed broad support for "freedom of expression" and assembly in Pakistan but stopped well short of encouraging demonstrations against Musharraf.
1558	AFP_ENG_20071106.0037.LDC2009T13	And leading US lawmakers upped the ante.
1559	AFP_ENG_20071106.0037.LDC2009T13	Democratic Senator Joseph Biden, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said Tuesday he had a "frank" telephone conversation with Musharraf.
1560	AFP_ENG_20071106.0037.LDC2009T13	"I told President Musharraf how critical it is for relations between our two countries that elections go forward as planned in January, that he follow through on his commitment to take off his uniform and that he restore the rule of law to Pakistan," he said in a statement.
1561	AFP_ENG_20071106.0037.LDC2009T13	"It is clear to me from our conversation that President Musharraf understands the consequences for his country and for relations with the United States if he does not return Pakistan to the path of democracy," he added.
1562	AFP_ENG_20071106.0037.LDC2009T13	Democratic Senator Patrick Leahy, who oversees aid to Pakistan as chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on State and Foreign Operations, said Washington should have supported the "moderate majority" rather than Musharraf, who has not fulfilled pledges on democracy since seizing power in a 1999 coup.
1563	AFP_ENG_20071106.0037.LDC2009T13	"The United States will continue its support to the Pakistani people," Leahy said in a statement posted on his website on Monday.
1564	AFP_ENG_20071106.0037.LDC2009T13	"But US aid to the Musharraf government should stop until constitutional order, civil liberties and judicial independence are restored, until political prisoners are released, and until free and fair elections are allowed," he said.c

1573	AFP_ENG_20071116.0303.LDC2009T13	"We are building a database on them."
1574	AFP_ENG_20071116.0303.LDC2009T13	He said that in addition Iraqi and US embassy officials had been meeting to resolve issues arising from its use of controversial private contractors, such as Blackwater and DynCorp, to guard diplomats and other staff in Iraq.
1575	AFP_ENG_20071116.0303.LDC2009T13	"We went to the US embassy to meet officials and agreed with them on regulating the companies' work, their rash reactions and inappropriate use of force," Khalaf said.
1576	AFP_ENG_20071116.0303.LDC2009T13	"Now a serious work has begun to regulate the work of companies before the new law will be enacted."
1577	AFP_ENG_20071116.0303.LDC2009T13	He said already there were signs private guards were beginning to behave more moderately.
1578	AFP_ENG_20071116.0303.LDC2009T13	"We noticed a big improvement in the companies' performances despite some individual incidents that took place," he said.
1579	AFP_ENG_20071116.0303.LDC2009T13	The New York Times reported this week that the FBI had initially found that at least 14 Iraqis were killed without justification in a September shootout in Baghdad involving guards from Blackwater.

1599	AFP_ENG_20071119.0091.LDC2009T13	The EU's Portuguese presidency on Monday vowed to deliver a "tough and clear message" to Zimbabwean leader Robert Mugabe at an EU-Africa summit in Lisbon next month, European sources said.
1600	AFP_ENG_20071119.0091.LDC2009T13	Foreign ministers from the 27 European Union member states, meeting in Brussels, considered how to deal with the possible presence of Mugabe at the summit on December 8-9.
1601	AFP_ENG_20071119.0091.LDC2009T13	If the Zimbabwean president does turn up then British Prime Minister Gordon Brown has vowed that neither he nor any senior cabinet member will attend the second EU-Africa summit, because of human rights abuses in the southern African nation.
1602	AFP_ENG_20071119.0091.LDC2009T13	If the veteran Zimbabwean leader does attend in Lisbon "there should be a very clear and detailed conversation about Mugabe's behaviour, abuse of human rights and his general unacceptable reactionary way in which he is mismanaging his country and abusing his citizens," Britain's European Affairs minister Jim Murphy told reporters after the talks
1603	AFP_ENG_20071119.0091.LDC2009T13	"It is the UK's view, however, that Mugabe shouldn't be attending the summit," he added.
1604	AFP_ENG_20071119.0091.LDC2009T13	Another British official stressed that "our position is unchanged.... If he does turn up then the prime minister won't attend and neither will any senior minister."
1605	AFP_ENG_20071119.0091.LDC2009T13	A European source said that "some member states want a real discussion on human rights and governance in Zimbabwe," while adding that most European capitals would prefer it if Mugabe decides not to accept the invitation to the Lisbon meeting.
1606	AFP_ENG_20071119.0091.LDC2009T13	Luis Amado, foreign minister of Portugal which currently holds the EU's rotating presidency, promised his fellow EU ministers that there would be a robust debate in Mugabe's presence if he did attend.
1607	AFP_ENG_20071119.0091.LDC2009T13	"We will organise a debate which will deliver a tough and clear message," Amado was quoted as saying.
1608	AFP_ENG_20071119.0091.LDC2009T13	He later told a press conference that the EU would send an observer mission to the region to discuss "the appropriate attitude to adopt".
1609	AFP_ENG_20071119.0091.LDC2009T13	Zimbabwe said Monday it had put its military on high alert against a possible British invasion after the former armed forces chief of its old colonial master revealed London had considered such a move.
1610	AFP_ENG_20071119.0091.LDC2009T13	Zimbabwe's relations with Britain were strained after the south African nation launched controversial land reforms in 2000, seizing farms from white farmers -- the majority of them of British descent -- to give to black farmers.
1611	AFP_ENG_20071119.0091.LDC2009T13	Mugabe was one of Tony Blair's most virulent critics before the British premier stood down in June, frequently accusing him of trying to force regime change and telling him to "keep his pink nose" out of Zimbabwe's internal politics.
1612	AFP_ENG_20071119.0091.LDC2009T13	However, African leaders have largely defended Mugabe's right to attend the EU- Africa summit, seven years after the first such summit was held.
1613	AFP_ENG_20071119.0091.LDC2009T13	German Chancellor Angela Merkel was among the EU leaders who has backed Mugabe's participation, saying the summit would be an opportunity to "raise all our criticisms" about the "disaster" in Zimbabwe.

1616	AFP_ENG_20071119.0323.LDC2009T13	Bhutto says no immediate plans for Musharraf talks
1617	AFP_ENG_20071119.0323.LDC2009T13	Former Pakistani premier Benazir Bhutto said Monday she had no immediate plans to revive US-backed power-sharing talks with President Pervez Musharraf amid the crisis over emergency rule.
1618	AFP_ENG_20071119.0323.LDC2009T13	At the same time her party withdrew a legal challenge to his re- election as president, arguing it did not want to recognise the new Supreme Court because it has been purged of most of its previous judges.
1619	AFP_ENG_20071119.0323.LDC2009T13	Bhutto did not, however, categorically rule out talks in the future and her words appeared to signal a slight shift in stance, having last week called on Musharraf to quit.
1620	AFP_ENG_20071119.0323.LDC2009T13	"I have had no meeting with Musharraf and no such meeting is scheduled," she told reporters in her power base in Karachi.
1621	AFP_ENG_20071119.0323.LDC2009T13	Her comments came after the United States called at the weekend for Bhutto and Musharraf to resume the Western-backed negotiations they had been holding before he imposed emergency rule on November 3.
1622	AFP_ENG_20071119.0323.LDC2009T13	"We are not going back to the former track," she told reporters earlier.
1623	AFP_ENG_20071119.0323.LDC2009T13	"I have made it clear that we are interested in a road map for democracy, but we do not have the confidence that General Musharraf's regime can give us that road map."
1624	AFP_ENG_20071119.0323.LDC2009T13	Bhutto was speaking after meeting US ambassador Anne Patterson.
1625	AFP_ENG_20071119.0323.LDC2009T13	It followed a weekend of face-to-face talks between US Deputy Secretary of State John Negroponte and Musharraf and other senior officials.
1626	AFP_ENG_20071119.0323.LDC2009T13	The envoy also spoke to Bhutto by telephone.
1627	AFP_ENG_20071119.0323.LDC2009T13	Before leaving, Negroponte urged them to resume their dialogue and for the military ruler to end the emergency, free political prisoners, lift curbs on the media and ensure fair elections.
1628	AFP_ENG_20071119.0323.LDC2009T13	The United States has been jolted by the crisis engulfing its key ally in the fight against Islamic militancy, and has eyed an alliance of two moderate, pro- Western figures as a bulwark against Al-Qaeda and the Taliban.
1629	AFP_ENG_20071119.0323.LDC2009T13	A close aide to Bhutto said that while she would not restart talks as long as Musharraf had not ended the emergency and quit as army chief, there was a possibility for dialogue afterwards.
1630	AFP_ENG_20071119.0323.LDC2009T13	He may resign as army chief later this week, after the Supreme Court Monday dismissed five of six challenges to his re-election as president.
1631	AFP_ENG_20071119.0323.LDC2009T13	Last week, the opposition leader seemed to have shut the door on talks for good, saying "it is over with Musharraf" and vowing never to work with him in government.
1632	AFP_ENG_20071119.0323.LDC2009T13	She also held talks with other opposition leaders on forging a united front to try to force Musharraf from office.
1633	AFP_ENG_20071119.0323.LDC2009T13	But she pointedly declined to repeat her anti-Musharraf rhetoric in a CNN interview Sunday, saying only, "Let's stop a moment and see whether he first responds to Washington."
1634	AFP_ENG_20071119.0323.LDC2009T13	Bhutto also stressed Monday that Islamic extremism, with militants making gains in Pakistan's northwest Swat valley, was the biggest threat facing the country since it won independence -- something Musharraf has also said.
1635	AFP_ENG_20071119.0323.LDC2009T13	Patterson told reporters as she left that she was meeting Bhutto and other political leaders to press for free, fair and transparent elections.
1636	AFP_ENG_20071119.0323.LDC2009T13	"The United States is interested in the reconciliation of all the moderate political elements," she said.
1637	AFP_ENG_20071119.0323.LDC2009T13	"I am here to assure her and all others that we will do everything possible to ensure that the election takes place."

1639	AFP_ENG_20071121.0417.LDC2009T13	Leaders of 16 Asian nations including China and India signed a pact on the environment Wednesday, pledging action on climate change and forest cover, and promoting the use of nuclear energy.
1640	AFP_ENG_20071121.0417.LDC2009T13	The East Asia Summit members threw their support behind a UN plan as the "core mechanism" for tackling global warming.
1641	AFP_ENG_20071121.0417.LDC2009T13	They committed to work harder to develop alternative energy sources and cleaner fossil-fuel technologies, and to improve energy efficiency and conservation.
1642	AFP_ENG_20071121.0417.LDC2009T13	The East Asia Summit, which embraces the 10-nation ASEAN bloc plus Australia, China, India, Japan, New Zealand and South Korea, now sets the stage for next month's UN-backed global climate change talks in Bali.
1643	AFP_ENG_20071121.0417.LDC2009T13	After the United Nations warned that illegal logging is devastating Southeast Asia's tropical rain forests, the leaders set a goal to increase forest cover by at least 15 million hectares (37 million acres) by 2020.
1644	AFP_ENG_20071121.0417.LDC2009T13	They also agreed to cooperate on the "development and the use of civilian nuclear power," amid concerns soaring oil prices could hurt regional economic growth, according to their joint declaration.
1645	AFP_ENG_20071121.0417.LDC2009T13	But they stressed that the use of atomic energy will be carried out in a "manner ensuring nuclear safety, security and non- proliferation" by adopting safeguards within the framework of the International Atomic Energy Agency watchdog.
1646	AFP_ENG_20071121.0417.LDC2009T13	Environmental groups have voiced concerns over the disposal of nuclear waste and the danger that plutonium -- a key ingredient for making atomic weapons -- could fall into the wrong hands.
1647	AFP_ENG_20071121.0417.LDC2009T13	A key focus of concern is Southeast Asian extremist group Jemaah Islamiyah, blamed for a series of attacks in the region including the 2002 Bali bombings that killed 202 people.
1648	AFP_ENG_20071121.0417.LDC2009T13	The 16 nations also agreed to work towards reducing energy intensity -- a measure of the energy efficiency of a nation's economy -- but dropped plans to aim for a 25 percent reduction by 2030.
1649	AFP_ENG_20071121.0417.LDC2009T13	An earlier draft of the declaration obtained by AFP indicated that India had objected to the 25 percent goal.
1650	AFP_ENG_20071121.0417.LDC2009T13	Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer expressed optimism that China and India would agree to eventually cut greenhouse gas emissions and said the East Asia Summit pact helped "pave the way for a successful Bali meeting."
1651	AFP_ENG_20071121.0417.LDC2009T13	"I think there has been a turning of the tide in terms of China and India's positions on climate change," Downer told reporters.
1652	AFP_ENG_20071121.0417.LDC2009T13	"Now we are at last seeing these major developing countries saying yes, we need to do things as well to stabilise greenhouse gas emissions," he said.
1653	AFP_ENG_20071121.0417.LDC2009T13	Two of the world's worst polluters, China and India ratified the Kyoto Protocol on climate change but, as developing nations, were not obliged to achieve fixed emissions reduction targets.
1654	AFP_ENG_20071121.0417.LDC2009T13	Delegates to the Bali talks will discuss a successor treaty to the Kyoto Protocol, which developed nations say must push China and India to cut pollution.
1655	AFP_ENG_20071121.0417.LDC2009T13	China's Prime Minister Wen Jiabao said earlier Wednesday that he will seek to increase cooperation with Asian nations on climate change and that the country will try to freeze its key pollution emissions at 2005 levels.
1656	AFP_ENG_20071121.0417.LDC2009T13	He said he would propose an international climate change forum in China next year to improve the region's ability to address global warming.
1657	AFP_ENG_20071121.0417.LDC2009T13	Japanese Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda also unveiled a hefty two- billion-dollar aid package over five years for developing Asian nations to help them tackle climate change.
1658	AFP_ENG_20071121.0417.LDC2009T13	It includes soft loans and training programmes aimed at helping developing nations address the issue while pursuing economic growth, and is focused on improving sewage processing and fighting pollution.

1661	AFP_ENG_20071130.0563.LDC2009T13	Traditional Malaysian "kopitiam" are making a comeback, serving cups of local-style brew and traditional fare as Malaysians discover a taste for nostalgia.
1662	AFP_ENG_20071130.0563.LDC2009T13	Kopitiam -- the word means "coffee shop" in the Hokkien dialect of ethnic Chinese in Malaysia -- were originally found in shophouses in villages and towns across the country, serving up coffee and breakfast.
1663	AFP_ENG_20071130.0563.LDC2009T13	Usually crowded, noisy and rather grimy, they were popular places to grab a quick drink and cheap street food.
1664	AFP_ENG_20071130.0563.LDC2009T13	Modern kopitiams have retained the old-fashioned marble-topped tables, wooden chairs and chunky crockery, but now they are to be found in the cavernous air- conditioned shopping malls of the capital Kuala Lumpur.
1665	AFP_ENG_20071130.0563.LDC2009T13	And with their thick brewed "kopi," they are holding their own against the cappuccinos and macchiatos offered by foreign coffee chains that exploded onto the Malaysian scene in the late nineties.
1666	AFP_ENG_20071130.0563.LDC2009T13	City-dwellers are rediscovering kopitiam fare such as soft-boiled eggs eaten with soya sauce and a dash of pepper, and bread toasted over a charcoal fire and slathered with salted butter and kaya, a rich coconut and egg jam.
1667	AFP_ENG_20071130.0563.LDC2009T13	"I grew up with this.
1668	AFP_ENG_20071130.0563.LDC2009T13	This is very nostalgic for me," said Maran Subramaniam as he sipped a cup of aromatic kopi and munched on kaya toast at Old Town White Coffee outlet in downtown Kuala Lumpur.
1669	AFP_ENG_20071130.0563.LDC2009T13	"The coffee is cheaper than Starbucks but that's not the only reason.
1670	AFP_ENG_20071130.0563.LDC2009T13	I just like it," said the 31-year-old executive, dressed in a crisp shirt and tie.
1671	AFP_ENG_20071130.0563.LDC2009T13	The new kopitiams also serve local favourites such as nasi lemak, a coconut flavoured rice with a fiery sambal or chilli paste, fried anchovies and egg on the side, and laksa -- noodles in a spicy broth.
1672	AFP_ENG_20071130.0563.LDC2009T13	One popular kopitiam chain is Kluang Station which in the past two years has opened four outlets around suburban Kuala Lumpur, as well as one in southern Malacca.
1673	AFP_ENG_20071130.0563.LDC2009T13	The chain is based on the famous coffee shop at the railway station in Kluang town in southern Johor state, opened in 1938 by the great-grandfather of the chain's owner Phun Jun Jee.
1674	AFP_ENG_20071130.0563.LDC2009T13	Phun credits his grandfather with maintaining the heritage of the original shop, where the family patriarch worked from the age of eight, and which is now in the hands of the third generation, Phun's uncle.
1675	AFP_ENG_20071130.0563.LDC2009T13	The coffee served at Kluang Station is made with beans roasted and ground the same way it has always been prepared.
1676	AFP_ENG_20071130.0563.LDC2009T13	"We make coffee the traditional way.
1677	AFP_ENG_20071130.0563.LDC2009T13	The coffee beans are roasted with sugar and fat in the form of butter.
1678	AFP_ENG_20071130.0563.LDC2009T13	It makes the drink smoother," Phun said.
1679	AFP_ENG_20071130.0563.LDC2009T13	The kaya at Kluang Station is also from a recipe handed down by his grandfather.
1680	AFP_ENG_20071130.0563.LDC2009T13	"My granddad used to make kaya in an old milk can and he would stir it over the fire and that's all the kaya he would use in one day," Phun said.
1681	AFP_ENG_20071130.0563.LDC2009T13	"Now, my kaya production has come up to four drums every three days.
1682	AFP_ENG_20071130.0563.LDC2009T13	Each drum uses about 1,500 eggs.
1683	AFP_ENG_20071130.0563.LDC2009T13	It has gone from a small amount in a tin can to enough to fill your bathtub."
1684	AFP_ENG_20071130.0563.LDC2009T13	Phun has also tried to recreate the atmosphere of the original kopitiam at the train station.
1685	AFP_ENG_20071130.0563.LDC2009T13	"I took almost everything I could capture from the original colonial train stations -- the wire mesh windows, the station sign boards, the wood finish.
1686	AFP_ENG_20071130.0563.LDC2009T13	I brought Kluang out of Kluang into Kuala Lumpur," he said.
1687	AFP_ENG_20071130.0563.LDC2009T13	As nostalgia fans the growth of modern kopitiams, some of the old coffee shops remain but no longer play a significant role in society -- except in small towns far from Malaysia's glittering capital.

1700	AFP_ENG_20071203.0044.LDC2009T13	"A boat which was carrying illegal migrants capsized," Mba Obame told AFP, adding that the exact date of the accident and the number of people on board were not known.

1720	AFP_ENG_20071213.0245.LDC2009T13	Football: Kahn should have been punished more, says Netzer
1721	AFP_ENG_20071213.0245.LDC2009T13	Bayern Munich captain Oliver Kahn was lucky to escape with a 25,000-euros (37,500-US dollars) fine and one-match suspension for his behaviour last weekend, according to former German international Guenter Netzer.
1722	AFP_ENG_20071213.0245.LDC2009T13	Kahn was reprimanded on Tuesday for comments made over the weekend when he criticised Bayern's stars Franck Ribery and Luca Toni for inconsistent performances and then made an early exit from the club's Christmas party on Saturday.
1723	AFP_ENG_20071213.0245.LDC2009T13	But coach Ottmar Hitzfeld's sanctions have generated plenty of debate in Germany with former midfielder and TV pundit Netzer insisting Bayern should have taken a tougher line on the former German national captain.
1724	AFP_ENG_20071213.0245.LDC2009T13	"I would have punished him more and taken the captaincy off him, because his actions show his ignorance towards his role in the team," said Netzer, who won 37 caps and helped West Germany win the 1972 European Championships.
1725	AFP_ENG_20071213.0245.LDC2009T13	Kahn has kept the captaincy, but is suspended for Saturday's Bundesliga clash with Hertha Berlin and should be back in goal for next Wednesday's UEFA Cup clash against Aris Thessaloniki.
1726	AFP_ENG_20071213.0245.LDC2009T13	Hitzfeld will issue his team with a code of conduct over the Bundesliga's winter break so his players know what is expected of them and what he considers to be appropriate behaviour in a bid to avoid any repetition of Kahn's comments.
1727	AFP_ENG_20071213.0245.LDC2009T13	"I had no other choice," said Hitzfeld when asked about his sanctions on Kahn.
1728	AFP_ENG_20071213.0245.LDC2009T13	"It's not always easy being a coach.
1729	AFP_ENG_20071213.0245.LDC2009T13	I respect Ollie as a person and a personality, he is loyal to me, as I am to him, but you have to separate that sometimes and somethings you just can't accept.
1730	AFP_ENG_20071213.0245.LDC2009T13	"I want to give out the code of conduct, so the players to be clear on what they can and can't do, so there is no misunderstanding."
1731	AFP_ENG_20071213.0245.LDC2009T13	Hitzfeld's contract expires at the end of the season and he has hinted at an interest in taking over as coach of the Swiss national team after next summer's Euro 2008 tournament.
1732	AFP_ENG_20071213.0245.LDC2009T13	Former Bayern midfielder and Germany international Stefan Effenberg says current VfB Stuttgart coach Armin Veh would be a good replacement.
1733	AFP_ENG_20071213.0245.LDC2009T13	"Armin Veh would be a good replacement, he has Champions League experience," said Effenberg.
1734	AFP_ENG_20071213.0245.LDC2009T13	"No one knows if Hitzfeld will stay in Munich for next season, but Veh would do a good job here if the job became vacant."

1740	AFP_ENG_20071214.0417.LDC2009T13	Football: Mixed emotions as England prepare for Italian job
1741	AFP_ENG_20071214.0417.LDC2009T13	Fabio Capello's impending appointment as the new England manager evoked mixed emotions Friday as the stark reality of the country's lack of home-grown candidates hit home.England's Football Assocation (FA) on Thursday approved Capello's appointment for a post which has been vacant since Steve McClaren was sacked in the wake of England's failure to qualify for 2008.
1742	AFP_ENG_20071214.0417.LDC2009T13	Capello, who won nine league titles in 15 seasons with four different clubs in Italy and Spain, is expected to be confirmed in the post Friday once negotiations over terms and the appointment of back room staff have concluded.
1743	AFP_ENG_20071214.0417.LDC2009T13	However the FA's choise to name the no-nonsense Italian has prompted mixed emotions.
1744	AFP_ENG_20071214.0417.LDC2009T13	Former England captain Paul Ince said Capello's impending appointment is a "sad indictment of English football".
1745	AFP_ENG_20071214.0417.LDC2009T13	And Ince, now the manager at League Two side MK Dons, believes the job should have gone to an Englishman.
1746	AFP_ENG_20071214.0417.LDC2009T13	"It's a sad indictment on English football that we've got to go to Europe for a manager," Ince told Saturday's Football Focus programme according to the BBC.
1747	AFP_ENG_20071214.0417.LDC2009T13	"We have got enough managers in England who could do just as good a job."
1748	AFP_ENG_20071214.0417.LDC2009T13	He added: "In English football we say you've got to get your qualifications, you've got to do this, you've got to get that.
1749	AFP_ENG_20071214.0417.LDC2009T13	"But when you build your CV up and they go out and get a foreign manager, sometimes you think, 'what's the point?'"
1750	AFP_ENG_20071214.0417.LDC2009T13	The 40-year-old added: "In time we're going to get to the stage - whether it's two years, three or four years - that Fabio might go and we've got to have a ready-made replacement for him and it's got to be English."
1751	AFP_ENG_20071214.0417.LDC2009T13	Capello is set to become the richest coach in international football when he signs a reported 6.5 million pounds (13 million dollars) a year contract, a deal that will see him earn four million annually after tax.
1752	AFP_ENG_20071214.0417.LDC2009T13	The size of the salary, compared to the 2.5 million pounds a year deal that McClaren was handed last year, is an indication of the FA's determination to sign a 'world-class' coach after the failure to qualify for Euro 2008 cost them at least 12 million pounds, and probably considerably more in terms of damage to the England brand.
1753	AFP_ENG_20071214.0417.LDC2009T13	Despite the 61-year-old Capello expressing a desire to have English coaches as part of his set-up, he is expected to bring three or four fellow Italians with him for his coaching staff, including his trusted aide Franco Baldini as his assistant.
1754	AFP_ENG_20071214.0417.LDC2009T13	That move has reportedly rankled with some, but others believe that Capello must be employed on his own terms or not at all.
1755	AFP_ENG_20071214.0417.LDC2009T13	"It's simple.
1756	AFP_ENG_20071214.0417.LDC2009T13	If you employ Fabio Capello, you give him what he wants," said former player Tony Cascarino, writing in The Times.
1757	AFP_ENG_20071214.0417.LDC2009T13	"You are buying into his winning formula, and you are doing it wholesale, not picking and choosing the bits that you like.
1758	AFP_ENG_20071214.0417.LDC2009T13	"You do not hand a man the keys to his new Ferrari then tie one hand behind his back."
1759	AFP_ENG_20071214.0417.LDC2009T13	Another former England player, Tony Adams, said he was a huge admirer of Capello's, having visited the Italian at Juventus to get a sneak view at some of his coaching methods.
1760	AFP_ENG_20071214.0417.LDC2009T13	But Adams, now working under Harry Redknapp at Portsmouth, reiterated Ince's view.
1761	AFP_ENG_20071214.0417.LDC2009T13	"I've got no argument with Capello's CV, it's a fantastic CV.
1762	AFP_ENG_20071214.0417.LDC2009T13	I'm a massive admirer of his but I still wouldn't have had him as England manager because I just wanted an Englishman to take this country forward."
1763	AFP_ENG_20071214.0639.LDC2009T13	Football: West Ham seeking swift revenge on Everton by Robin Millard
1764	AFP_ENG_20071214.0639.LDC2009T13	West Ham United get an early chance for revenge against Everton on Saturday, three days after the Toffees dumped them out of the League Cup quarter-finals.
1765	AFP_ENG_20071214.0639.LDC2009T13	But Everton will be hoping to catch hosts West Ham off-guard once more at Upton Park when they clash in the English Premier League, as the east London club get used to life without Eggert Magnusson.
1766	AFP_ENG_20071214.0639.LDC2009T13	He stepped down as chairman on Thursday, leaving owner and fellow Icelander Bjorgolfur Gudmundsson in sole charge.
1767	AFP_ENG_20071214.0639.LDC2009T13	The Toffees are on a high, chasing a Champions League spot in the league and still in the FA, League and UEFA Cups.
1768	AFP_ENG_20071214.0639.LDC2009T13	And the Liverpool club's Nigeria striker Yakubu is in hot form, scoring his 10th goal of the season with the 88th-minute winner against the Hammers in Wednesday's 2-1 win at Upton Park.
1769	AFP_ENG_20071214.0639.LDC2009T13	Joseph Yobo, Yakubu's Everton and Nigeria teammate, reckoned West Ham will be hell-bent on avenging their quarter-final defeat.
1770	AFP_ENG_20071214.0639.LDC2009T13	"It will be really difficult on Saturday and a completely different game," he told evertonTV.
1771	AFP_ENG_20071214.0639.LDC2009T13	"In football, you can't talk about revenge but West Ham are going to want to get their own back.
1772	AFP_ENG_20071214.0639.LDC2009T13	We will just go out and do our best again."
1773	AFP_ENG_20071214.0639.LDC2009T13	But Yobo warned the Hammers to be wary of hitman Yakubu, an 11.25 -million-pound (22.9-million-dollar) purchase from Middlesbrough in August.
1774	AFP_ENG_20071214.0639.LDC2009T13	"He is always going to score goals when he gets the chance and he does not miss when he gets chances," he said.
1775	AFP_ENG_20071214.0639.LDC2009T13	"The way we are playing suits Yak at the moment.
1776	AFP_ENG_20071214.0639.LDC2009T13	At first it was a bit difficult when he came here.
1777	AFP_ENG_20071214.0639.LDC2009T13	Now everyone can see he has adapted well into the team and everybody is having fun.
1778	AFP_ENG_20071214.0639.LDC2009T13	"He is enjoying himself and the games -- he is more confident so the goals are just going to come naturally from Yakubu.
1779	AFP_ENG_20071214.0639.LDC2009T13	I think he has more to come but we will have to wait and see."
1780	AFP_ENG_20071214.0639.LDC2009T13	Everton, unbeaten in 11 league and cup matches, are seventh in the Premier League table.
1781	AFP_ENG_20071214.0639.LDC2009T13	Buoyant Toffees boss David Moyes said of the West Ham rematch: "I'm looking forward to coming back on Saturday.
1782	AFP_ENG_20071214.0639.LDC2009T13	Hopefully we'll do the same again, and play the same way again."
1783	AFP_ENG_20071214.0639.LDC2009T13	Everton are five points ahead of the Hammers, who are 10th.
1784	AFP_ENG_20071214.0639.LDC2009T13	West Ham boss Alan Curbishley is starting his second year in charge with the club in a much better position than when he took over.
1785	AFP_ENG_20071214.0639.LDC2009T13	Last December, the Hammers had 14 points from 17 games and seemed doomed to relegation.
1786	AFP_ENG_20071214.0639.LDC2009T13	But now the club is chasing a UEFA Cup spot and hoping this week's boardroom shake-up can keep West Ham aiming high.
1787	AFP_ENG_20071214.0639.LDC2009T13	Banker Gudmundsson bought Magnusson's five-percent stake in the Hammers and invested a further 30.5 million pounds into the club.
1788	AFP_ENG_20071214.0639.LDC2009T13	But he made clear his cash injection is targeted towards firming up the club's financial base for the future, meaning that a new stadium will be the spending priority rather than new players in the January transfer window.
1789	AFP_ENG_20071214.0639.LDC2009T13	That could mean boss Alan Curbishley may have to go without bringing in cover for Craig Bellamy.
1790	AFP_ENG_20071214.0639.LDC2009T13	The Wales striker has spent six weeks out recovering from surgery on a persistent abdominal injury, but the problem has not gone away and he may now require further surgery to correct the problem.
1791	AFP_ENG_20071214.0639.LDC2009T13	"We have to decide this week where we are going to go with Craig," Curbishley said.
1792	AFP_ENG_20071214.0639.LDC2009T13	"We have to decide whether to continue with the route we are going down which, if it is successful, will result in a shorter route.

1801	AFP_ENG_20071220.0150.LDC2009T13	French environmentalists on Thursday slammed a decision to coat part of the Eiffel Tower with artificial snow for the festive season, saying it was a costly waste of water.
1802	AFP_ENG_20071220.0150.LDC2009T13	The first of the iron tower's three floors, 57 metres (125 feet) above ground, has been clad in 20 to 30 centimetres (eight to 12 inches) of snow, with free rackets on hand for tourists to trek across the Paris monument.
1803	AFP_ENG_20071220.0150.LDC2009T13	But the association Robin des Bois (Robin Hood) attacked the operation, part of a photo exhibition on the North and South Poles running until December 31, saying it would waste "thousands" of cubic metres of water.
1804	AFP_ENG_20071220.0150.LDC2009T13	It accused the Eiffel Tower of "exploiting global warming" for commercial gain, saying there were "more appropriate places in Paris to hold an exhibition on the polar caps."
1805	AFP_ENG_20071220.0150.LDC2009T13	The tower's managing company rejected the charge, saying the Christmas operation would use no more than 60 cubic metres of water.

1808	AFP_ENG_20071221.0389.LDC2009T13	President Robert Mugabe said Friday that foreign mining firms who invest in Zimbabwe would be allowed to retain majority stakes under controversial ownership regulations.
1809	AFP_ENG_20071221.0389.LDC2009T13	"Where we read that a company has invested its profits over the years, we will not demand majority shareholding but, of course, we will need some shares," the state New Ziana news agency quoted Mugabe as saying during a meeting with Zimbabwean ambassadors.
1810	AFP_ENG_20071221.0389.LDC2009T13	The veteran leader commended the Zimbabwe Platinum Company (Zimplats) for building houses and roads, urging other companies to take a cue from the firm, whose majority shareholder is South Africa's Implats.
1811	AFP_ENG_20071221.0389.LDC2009T13	The Zimbabwe government plans to amend the Mines and Minerals Act by inserting a clause providing for compulsory state acquisition of 51 percent of all foreign- owned mining firms.
1812	AFP_ENG_20071221.0389.LDC2009T13	Under current laws, locals are entitled to a 15 percent stake in foreign-owned mining ventures, but there have been few takers.
1813	AFP_ENG_20071221.0389.LDC2009T13	The Chamber of Mines, representing 200 mining houses in Zimbabwe, warned last year that the proposed amendments would effectively kill off investment needed to keep the mines open.

1815	AFP_ENG_20071221.0389.LDC2009T13	In June last year during a tour of Zimplats, Mugabe stressed that the new ownership rules would not apply across the board.
1816	AFP_ENG_20071221.0389.LDC2009T13	New Ziana said Mugabe expressed concern that the mining sector was reporting a decline in production and consequently in foreign currency earnings and yet mining operations were continuing.
1817	AFP_ENG_20071221.0389.LDC2009T13	Mugabe also lashed out at some black managers of large manufacturing companies, accusing them of frustrating government efforts to revive the econony.

1823	AFP_ENG_20071223.0235.LDC2009T13	In an interview with Croat newspaper Sportske Novosti, the 25 -year-old Brazilian playmaker said: "It's true that we've talked about extending my contract until 2013 and we'll do that as soon as the club invites me to sign."

1830	AFP_ENG_20080101.0040.LDC2009T13	Reigning 100-meter Olympic champion Justin Gatlin has been suspended for four years for a 2006 doping violation after his 20-month appeal fight failed, the Washington Post reported Tuesday.
1831	AFP_ENG_20080101.0040.LDC2009T13	Citing unnamed sources close to the case, the newspaper reported that Gatlin was told Monday night that arbitrators voted 2-1 to impose a four-year ban upon the 25-year-old American sprinter who captured gold at the 2004 Athens Games.
1832	AFP_ENG_20080101.0040.LDC2009T13	The punishment stems from a positive test for testosterone by Gatlin at the Kansas Relays on April 22, 2006.
1833	AFP_ENG_20080101.0040.LDC2009T13	Gatlin tested positive for a stimulant at a college meet earlier in his career so was treated as a repeat offender.
1834	AFP_ENG_20080101.0040.LDC2009T13	Gatlin could appeal the verdict to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS), the final legal recourse to overturn what would otherwise likely be a career-ending banishment.
1835	AFP_ENG_20080101.0040.LDC2009T13	Gatlin's attorney, John Collins, declined to comment to the newspaper, saying he wanted to see the 53-page majority opinion and 22-page dissent before saying anything publicly.
1836	AFP_ENG_20080101.0040.LDC2009T13	Two of the trio of arbitrators who heard the case July 29 through August 1 in Atlanta declared they could not impose anything less than a four-year ban upon Gatlin because of his prior positive test.
1837	AFP_ENG_20080101.0040.LDC2009T13	Gatlin, the 2005 world 100m and 200m champion, had faced up to an eight-year ban but was nonetheless devastated by the decision that could doom his hopes of racing at the Beijing Olympics, the Post said, citing people close to Gatlin.

1839	AFP_ENG_20080101.0040.LDC2009T13	Gatlin argued to arbitartors that his secret recording of telephone calls with his former coach and assistant coach to gather evidence for a federal steroid investigation should be considered in imposing a sentence.
1840	AFP_ENG_20080101.0040.LDC2009T13	Gatlin said if he had knowingly taken performance-enhancing drugs, it would have been revealed in 10 telephone calls he recorded in 2006 with former coach Trevor Graham and Randall Evans, Graham's assistant.
1841	AFP_ENG_20080101.0040.LDC2009T13	Graham has been indicted on charges of lying to federal investigators about his relationship with a confessed steroid dealer.
1842	AFP_ENG_20080101.0040.LDC2009T13	Jeff Novitzky, the federal agent investigating Graham as well as the BALCO steroid scandal, told the arbitrators that no evidence was uncovered that Gatlin took drugs.
1843	AFP_ENG_20080101.0040.LDC2009T13	Gatlin also argued that he might have been sabotaged by a massage therapist who could have rubbed a testosterone cream onto Gatlin's legs over being denied a bonus in 2005.
1844	AFP_ENG_20080101.0040.LDC2009T13	The therapist denied the claim but also said he did not think Gatlin was a dope cheat.
1845	AFP_ENG_20080101.0040.LDC2009T13	Another part of Gatlin's case was that he would not have tried to sneak testosterone past dope tests at an early season meet then not used it for the remainder of the 2006 season.
1846	AFP_ENG_20080101.0040.LDC2009T13	Chris Campbell, the arbitrator who dissented in the four-year ban verdict, said Gatlin had proven his sabotage case only 33 percent not the 50.1 percent needed to avoid punishment - a gap Gatlin could try to close before CAS.
1847	AFP_ENG_20080101.0040.LDC2009T13	Campbell also said Gatlin had been discriminated against under the Americans with Disabilities Act because his first positive was for a stimulant that was included in his medication for attention-deficit disorder.

1854	AFP_ENG_20080107.0269.LDC2009T13	"The rules of the game should be the same for every country, big ones and small ones, and they should apply to France, too," Slovenian Finance Minister Andrej Bajuk told a news conference here.

1861	AFP_ENG_20080108.0689.LDC2009T13	Australian media turned on the nation's world champion cricketers over a bitter dispute with India Tuesday, branding their behaviour "boorish" and "arrogant", with one newspaper demanding captain Ricky Ponting be axed.
1862	AFP_ENG_20080108.0689.LDC2009T13	Sydney's Daily Telegraph said the crisis that had engulfed the game since Australia's ill-tempered second Test victory over India here on Sunday was the worst since the infamous Bodyline series against England in 1932-33.
1863	AFP_ENG_20080108.0689.LDC2009T13	The row erupted after Indian spinner Harbhajan Singh received a three-match suspension for allegedly calling Australia's only black player Andrew Symonds a "monkey" and the Indians accused the host nation of not playing in the spirit of the game.
1864	AFP_ENG_20080108.0689.LDC2009T13	"The arrogant Ponting must be sacked," ran the front page headline in the Sydney Morning Herald, while the banner heading The Australian newspaper's feature page screamed "Ugly Australians".
1865	AFP_ENG_20080108.0689.LDC2009T13	With India delaying the next stage of its tour Down Under over spinner Singh's suspension for racism, the media turned the spotlight on the Australian behaviour that has left the tourists seething.
1866	AFP_ENG_20080108.0689.LDC2009T13	"It has become apparent in recent years that the attitude and behaviour of Australian players worsens the moment their superiority is seriously challenged," The Australian's Mike Coward wrote.
1867	AFP_ENG_20080108.0689.LDC2009T13	He said the Australian cricketers regarded themselves as hard- nosed and aggressive but failed to understand that many in their own country and beyond found their antics "boorish, arrogant and ungracious".
1868	AFP_ENG_20080108.0689.LDC2009T13	The Sydney Morning Herald's Peter Roebuck singled out Ponting as the main culprit, saying he should be sacked because he was so intent on victory that he allowed his team to behave in a way that embarrassed Australia.
1869	AFP_ENG_20080108.0689.LDC2009T13	"He turned a group of professional cricketers into a pack of wild dogs," Roebuck wrote, citing the failure by some players to walk when clearly out, the sledging aimed at the Indians and Australia's strutting victory celebrations.

1871	AFP_ENG_20080108.0706.LDC2009T13	This year's Golden Globes ceremony has been cancelled, organizers said Monday, making the star-studded awards show the highest- profile casualty of the Hollywood writer's strike.
1872	AFP_ENG_20080108.0706.LDC2009T13	The Hollywood Foreign Press Association (HFPA) and broadcasters NBC announced the decision to replace the show with a press conference after actors last week vowed to boycott the event in support of striking writers.
1873	AFP_ENG_20080108.0706.LDC2009T13	The HFPA and NBC said that instead of the traditional dinner and awards ceremony, this year's Golden Globes winners would be revealed during an hour long press conference at 6 pm (0200 GMT) Sunday in Beverly Hills.
1874	AFP_ENG_20080108.0706.LDC2009T13	"We are all very disappointed that our traditional awards ceremony will not take place this year and that millions of viewers worldwide will be deprived of seeing many of their favorite stars celebrating 2007's outstanding achievements in motion pictures and television," said HFPA president Jorge Camara.
1875	AFP_ENG_20080108.0706.LDC2009T13	"We take some comfort, however, in knowing that this year’s Golden Globe Award recipients will be announced on the date originally scheduled."
1876	AFP_ENG_20080108.0706.LDC2009T13	The statement did not give further information about Sunday's awards, which are regarded as a key indicator of likely winners at the following month's Oscars and are one of the highlights of Hollywood's awards season.
1877	AFP_ENG_20080108.0706.LDC2009T13	The influential movie industry blog deadlinehollywooddaily.com reported earlier Monday that stars would still be able to attend a red carpet arrivals event prior to the press conference.
1878	AFP_ENG_20080108.0706.LDC2009T13	However an unnamed studio publicist quoted by the Hollywood Reporter trade magazine questioned how many stars would bother attending a press conference instead of a champagne dinner.
1879	AFP_ENG_20080108.0706.LDC2009T13	"Unless I know my guy is winning, I'm not sending stars in to sit on a folding chair just to hear someone else's name read out at a press conference," the publicist told the magazine's online edition.
1880	AFP_ENG_20080108.0706.LDC2009T13	The fate of the Globes had been hanging in the balance ever since striking writers confirmed plans to erect picket lines around the awards show last week.
1881	AFP_ENG_20080108.0706.LDC2009T13	On Friday, the Screen Actors Guild (SAG) announced that its members would not cross picket lines set up by writers.
1882	AFP_ENG_20080108.0706.LDC2009T13	The prospect of an awards show stripped of its stars immediately cast plans for the event into doubt.

1885	AFP_ENG_20080108.0706.LDC2009T13	The two-month strike has forced the suspension of numerous television series as well as the postponement of work on several Hollywood films.
1886	AFP_ENG_20080108.0706.LDC2009T13	The dispute has also cast a shadow over plans for next month's 80th Academy Awards, the highlight of the movie industry's awards season.
1887	AFP_ENG_20080108.0706.LDC2009T13	Last month it emerged that the WGA had barred its members from working at both the Oscars and the Golden Globes, ruling out the possibility of granting a waiver to the two awards shows.

1890	AFP_ENG_20080110.0047.LDC2009T13	The proof was delivered to Venezuelan Interior Minister Ramon Rodriguez Chacin, who traveled aboard one of the Venezuelan helicopters that flew to a secret site in Colombia to pick up Rojas, who ran the presidential campaign of Franco- Colombian Ingrid Betancourt -- still held hostage -- and former legislator Consuelo Gonzalez de Perdomo.
1891	AFP_ENG_20080110.0047.LDC2009T13	FARC rebels kidnapped Gonzalez, now 57, in 2001 and Rojas, now 44, in February 2002.

1958	AFP_ENG_20080123.0352.LDC2009T13	Cash-till receipts from the night indicate that Paul had ordered Ricard, an aniseed-type spirit which goes cloudy when water is added.
1959	AFP_ENG_20080123.0352.LDC2009T13	But Rees said he did not realise the driver was drinking alcohol.
1960	AFP_ENG_20080123.0352.LDC2009T13	"I didn't pay attention to what he was drinking, I didn't think that they were alcoholic drinks at the time," he told the inquest into Diana's death, at London's High Court.
1961	AFP_ENG_20080123.0352.LDC2009T13	"He was perfectly normal.
1962	AFP_ENG_20080123.0352.LDC2009T13	I didn't sense that he was on edge, he was just as I knew him," Rees said in a statement to police read out at the hearing.
1963	AFP_ENG_20080123.0352.LDC2009T13	Rees said he did not see Paul drinking alcohol at any point during the evening.
1964	AFP_ENG_20080123.0352.LDC2009T13	Asked whether, if he had seen him doing so "you would have ensured one way or another, that he wouldn't drive the car", he replied: "That's correct."
1965	AFP_ENG_20080123.0352.LDC2009T13	Fayed and Paul were killed instantly in the crash, while Diana died from internal injuries a few hours later.
1966	AFP_ENG_20080123.0352.LDC2009T13	Rees suffered severe facial injuries and memory loss in the crash.
1967	AFP_ENG_20080123.0352.LDC2009T13	Fayed's father Mohamed Al Fayed, the owner of plush London department store Harrods, claims they were killed in a British establishment conspiracy.
1968	AFP_ENG_20080123.0352.LDC2009T13	But Rees said he knew nothing of any such plot.
1969	AFP_ENG_20080123.0352.LDC2009T13	"I am not part of a conspiracy to suppress the truth at all," he said in a soft voice.
1970	AFP_ENG_20080123.0352.LDC2009T13	"All I have ever done is given the truth as I see it."

1972	AFP_ENG_20080123.0392.LDC2009T13	Michael Chang, the French Open's youngest men's champion, was among three people voted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame for 2008, the sport's honor shrine announced Wednesday.
1973	AFP_ENG_20080123.0392.LDC2009T13	Also set to be enshrined at ceremonies here on July 12 during an ATP event are two posthumous honorees in the contributor category, sports agent Mark McCormack and Tennis Week founder and publisher Gene Scott.
1974	AFP_ENG_20080123.0392.LDC2009T13	Their inclusion after receiving a 75 percent approval vote from a selection committee boosts membership in the elite group to 207 people from 18 nations.
1975	AFP_ENG_20080123.0392.LDC2009T13	Chang won the 1989 French Open men's crown at 17 years and three months, the first US man since Tony Trabert in 1955 to take the title on the red clay at Roland Garros.
1976	AFP_ENG_20080123.0392.LDC2009T13	In his 16-year career, Chang reached the world number two ranking and spent seven years in the top 10.
1977	AFP_ENG_20080123.0392.LDC2009T13	He won 34 ATP titles and lost in the finals of 24 other events, including the 1995 French Open and 1996 US and Australian Opens.
1978	AFP_ENG_20080123.0392.LDC2009T13	"It's truly an honor to be inducted," Chang said.
1979	AFP_ENG_20080123.0392.LDC2009T13	"It has been an incredible privilege to compete against the best players in the world for over 16 years and I will always cherish and forever remember my experiences on tour."
1980	AFP_ENG_20080123.0392.LDC2009T13	McCormack died in 2003 at age 72 and revolutionized the sports marketing business through global giant IMG.
1981	AFP_ENG_20080123.0392.LDC2009T13	Scott died in 2006 at age 68.
1982	AFP_ENG_20080123.0392.LDC2009T13	He founded the weekly tennis magazine in 1974 and served as a television analyst for the famed 1973 "Battle of the Sexes" match between Billie Jean King and Bobby Riggs.
1983	AFP_ENG_20080123.0392.LDC2009T13	He reached 11th in the world rankings in 1965 and played on the US Davis Cup team from 1963 through 1965.
1984	AFP_ENG_20080124.0048.LDC2009T13	US not interested in permanent Iraq bases: Gates
1985	AFP_ENG_20080124.0048.LDC2009T13	The United States has no interest in setting up permanent bases in Iraq, US Defense Secretary Robert Gates said Thursday, playing down concerns raised by negotiations on the future US military presence in Iraq.
1986	AFP_ENG_20080124.0048.LDC2009T13	Democratic critics have expressed fears that a planned "Status of Forces Agreement" (SOFA) with Iraq will tie the hands of future US presidents by committing the United States to a long-term military presence.
1987	AFP_ENG_20080124.0048.LDC2009T13	But Gates said, "I think it is pretty clear that such an agreement would not talk about force levels.
1988	AFP_ENG_20080124.0048.LDC2009T13	It would not involve -- we have no interest in permanent bases," he told reporters.
1989	AFP_ENG_20080124.0048.LDC2009T13	"I think the way to think about the framework agreement is an approach to normalizing the relationship between the United States and Iraq," he added.
1990	AFP_ENG_20080124.0048.LDC2009T13	Some Democrats, including Senator Joe Biden, chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, have demanded that any agreement be sent to the US Congress for approval.
1991	AFP_ENG_20080124.0048.LDC2009T13	Gates insisted discussions on the SOFA have barely begun and it is not yet clear what form it will take.
1992	AFP_ENG_20080124.0048.LDC2009T13	"I do know that there's a strong commitment inside the administration to consult very closely with the Congress on this," Gates said.
1993	AFP_ENG_20080124.0048.LDC2009T13	"But, you know, without any idea of what the form of an agreement is going to be right now, I think it's premature to talk about congressional agreement or executive agreement.
1994	AFP_ENG_20080124.0048.LDC2009T13	I think we just don't know," he said.
1995	AFP_ENG_20080124.0048.LDC2009T13	State Department spokesman Tom Casey earlier said negotiations on a status of forces agreement with Iraq aimed to keep security options open beyond 2008 when the UN mandate for US forces ends.
1996	AFP_ENG_20080124.0048.LDC2009T13	For example, he added, it would give US forces the option of continuing to hunt members of Al-Qaeda and train Iraqi troops.
1997	AFP_ENG_20080124.0048.LDC2009T13	Such an agreement "is very much the model that we use for regular bilateral relations between the United States and most other countries in the world," Casey said.
1998	AFP_ENG_20080124.0048.LDC2009T13	When asked if the agreement would include any reference to permanent bases, he replied: "We're not seeking permanent bases in Iraq.
1999	AFP_ENG_20080124.0048.LDC2009T13	That's been a clear matter of policy for some time.
2000	AFP_ENG_20080124.0048.LDC2009T13	No, the agreement is not a basing agreement."
2001	AFP_ENG_20080124.0048.LDC2009T13	Asked how Washington would respond if Baghdad asked for bases, he replied a distinction had to be made between the legal foundation on which US troops operate over a given term and tactical decisions on how to proceed.
2002	AFP_ENG_20080124.0048.LDC2009T13	"Those are the decisions that are made by US commanders on the ground, working with their Iraqi counterparts, and ultimately blessed by policy makers," he said.
2003	AFP_ENG_20080124.0048.LDC2009T13	"There is no anticipation that this is somehow going to forever lock in stone a particular level of troops or a particular set of activities or goals.
2004	AFP_ENG_20080124.0048.LDC2009T13	Again, it's a legal framework," he said.

2006	AFP_ENG_20080124.0597.LDC2009T13	The United States will help Vietnam upgrade aviation security to enable state- run carrier Vietnam Airlines to launch direct flights to the United States, the US embassy said Thursday.
2007	AFP_ENG_20080124.0597.LDC2009T13	The US Trade and Development Agency is providing 1.4 million dollars to upgrade Vietnam’s aviation safety oversight capability to international standards, the embassy said in a statement.
2008	AFP_ENG_20080124.0597.LDC2009T13	Vietnam Airlines recently filed for a foreign air carrier permit with the US Transportation Department that would allow for direct air services between Ho Chi Minh City and Los Angeles via Osaka, Japan.
2009	AFP_ENG_20080124.0597.LDC2009T13	"With Vietnam’s recent accession to the World Trade Organization, direct air service between the United States and Vietnam offers opportunities for increased bilateral trade and tourism," the US statement said.

2015	AFP_ENG_20080125.5030.LDC2009T13	The Six Nations, rugby union's most consistently inconsistent major tournament, swings into action next weekend with picking a winner in the latest edition of the 125-year-old Championship promising to be an especially difficult task.
2016	AFP_ENG_20080125.5030.LDC2009T13	European rugby finds itself in a much better state than the one forceast by many pundits who predicted the Tri-Nations would dominate the World Cup only to see both Australia and New Zealand fail to reach the last four.
2017	AFP_ENG_20080125.5030.LDC2009T13	Although there was a southern hemipshere winner in South Africa, England recovered from a dreadful run of results to reach the final.
2018	AFP_ENG_20080125.5030.LDC2009T13	Hosts France had a nervy run to the last four while Ireland and Wales both disappointed their followers in not reaching the quarter-finals - something achieved by Scotland at Italy's expense.
2019	AFP_ENG_20080125.5030.LDC2009T13	But just as advertisements for enticing financial products warn in the small print that past performance is no indicator of future success, so using recent form is rarely a reliable guide to potential placings in the Six Nations.
2020	AFP_ENG_20080125.5030.LDC2009T13	This year's edition has been given a fresh element of uncertainty by the appointment of three new coaches - Nick Mallett (Italy), Marc Lievremont (France) and Warren Gatland (Wales) who in turn have selected three new captains in Sergio Parisse, Lionel Nallet and Ryan Jones respectively.
2021	AFP_ENG_20080125.5030.LDC2009T13	Gatland's arrival as coach of Wales will throw-up several intriguing sub-plots.
2022	AFP_ENG_20080125.5030.LDC2009T13	The New Zealander will go head to head with both his predecessor as his Ireland boss, Brian Ashton, now England's coach, in his first match in charge of his new side and later in the tournament will take on Ireland successor Eddie O'Sullivan.
2023	AFP_ENG_20080125.5030.LDC2009T13	"I understand the Six Nations as a tournament," said Gatland, the latest Kiwi to coach Wales after Graham Henry and Steve Hansen.
2024	AFP_ENG_20080125.5030.LDC2009T13	"Some of the Kiwis or Aussies when they first come here they don't understand it's not just a game of rugby.
2025	AFP_ENG_20080125.5030.LDC2009T13	The Six Nations is an event.
2026	AFP_ENG_20080125.5030.LDC2009T13	"There's so much more involved, it's the build-up of two or three days and (for fans) the celebrating and partying before and after."
2027	AFP_ENG_20080125.5030.LDC2009T13	England may be the team the others love to beat but two third and fourth place finishes in the four years since a Grand Slam heralded their World Cup triumph in 2003 are well bellow expectations and now Ashton's task is to make his side well worth beating once again.
2028	AFP_ENG_20080125.5030.LDC2009T13	Not that he was prepared to tip his side or anyone else's as favourites.
2029	AFP_ENG_20080125.5030.LDC2009T13	"You can't predict a winner," Ashton said.
2030	AFP_ENG_20080125.5030.LDC2009T13	"There is always an unpredictability about the Six Nations but this year, with three new coaches, there is an uncertainty too."
2031	AFP_ENG_20080125.5030.LDC2009T13	Wales will be looking for their first win at Twickenham in 20 years when the tournament begins on February 2 while Mallett's men are away to Ireland.
2032	AFP_ENG_20080125.5030.LDC2009T13	A day later Six Nations champions France, bidding to avoid a repeat of their shock defeat of two years ago, face Scotland at Murrayfield.
2033	AFP_ENG_20080125.5030.LDC2009T13	Last season saw Italy achieve their best Six Nations placing of fourth and Mallett, who led his native South Africa to a record- equalling 17 straight Test wins, said: "Italy have the potential up front to really dominate teams but I want to see them be more ruthless."
2034	AFP_ENG_20080125.5030.LDC2009T13	Educated at England's Oxford University and having coached French giants Stade Francais, Mallett is familiar with the Six Nations' distinctive charms.
2035	AFP_ENG_20080125.5030.LDC2009T13	"It's a fantastic competition.
2036	AFP_ENG_20080125.5030.LDC2009T13	Paris is a fantastic destination and Rome is probably the best destination.
2037	AFP_ENG_20080125.5030.LDC2009T13	Watching rugby in a fantastic stadium (the Stadio Flaminio) which is packed, it's like a bull-fighting arena, it's just wonderful," he enthused.
2038	AFP_ENG_20080125.5030.LDC2009T13	"The Six Nations has got atmosphere to beat any other competition," Mallett added.
2039	AFP_ENG_20080125.5030.LDC2009T13	"The Tri-Nations is a very high standard of rugby but it's quite repetitive.
2040	AFP_ENG_20080125.5030.LDC2009T13	Often in the Six Nations there are results you don't expect."

2042	AFP_ENG_20080128.0497.LDC2009T13	Thailand is ready to discuss its pricing policy for alcohol imports from the EU, but rejected a European complaint that its system was "arbitrary," a top customs official said Monday.
2043	AFP_ENG_20080128.0497.LDC2009T13	The European Union has made the first step with the World Trade Organisation towards a formal complaint over Thailand's pricing for EU alcohol imports, accusing the kingdom of ignoring the declared value of the products.
2044	AFP_ENG_20080128.0497.LDC2009T13	EU Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson said in a statement that the policy was "arbitrary and damaging for EU companies seeking to do business in Thailand."
2045	AFP_ENG_20080128.0497.LDC2009T13	Natina Santiyanont, head of Thailand's Customs Procedures and Valuation Directorate, said the kingdom was ready to meet with the Europeans to explain their policy.
2046	AFP_ENG_20080128.0497.LDC2009T13	She said that values on products were only changed if companies failed to prove that their pricing was accurate.
2047	AFP_ENG_20080128.0497.LDC2009T13	"We have standards to maintain and to facilitate importers that are honest and comply with rules and regulations," she said.
2048	AFP_ENG_20080128.0497.LDC2009T13	"Our pricing policy is based on the transaction value of the imported goods... That is in line with the WTO and recognised by Thai laws," she said.
2049	AFP_ENG_20080128.0497.LDC2009T13	Natina said the customs department would meet with EU representatives within a few days.
2050	AFP_ENG_20080128.0497.LDC2009T13	The EU lodged the request on Friday.
2051	AFP_ENG_20080128.0497.LDC2009T13	If talks between the two sides do not resolve the issue within 60 days, the EU will be able to ask the WTO to rule on the legality of the Thai measures.

2054	AFP_ENG_20080129.0608.LDC2009T13	Australian fast bowler Shaun Tait on Tuesday quit all levels of cricket due to physical and emotional exhaustion.
2055	AFP_ENG_20080129.0608.LDC2009T13	Tait, 24, has struggled with injury since shortly after being named to the Australian Test eleven midway through its unsuccessful Ashes tour of England in 2005.
2056	AFP_ENG_20080129.0608.LDC2009T13	He has played only three Tests, the last being against India in Perth this month during which he took no wickets.
2057	AFP_ENG_20080129.0608.LDC2009T13	India won the match by 72 runs.
2058	AFP_ENG_20080129.0608.LDC2009T13	Tait, who was named the International Cricket Council's emerging player of 2007, said it had been a difficult decision to take a break from the game.
2059	AFP_ENG_20080129.0608.LDC2009T13	"This is not an overnight decision but something that I've been struggling with for sometime," he said in a statement.
2060	AFP_ENG_20080129.0608.LDC2009T13	"A break from professional cricket will hopefully give me a clear mind and a chance for my body to rest and recover.
2061	AFP_ENG_20080129.0608.LDC2009T13	"My love and enjoyment of the game is struggling due to these issues and if I continue to go on, it will be unfair on my team mates and support staff of both the Australian and South Australian cricket teams -- and most importantly my family and close friends."
2062	AFP_ENG_20080129.0608.LDC2009T13	Cricket Australia said Tait was suffering from "physical and emotional exhaustion and will be rested from cricket while he undergoes a programme designed to facilitate his return to cricket."
2063	AFP_ENG_20080129.0608.LDC2009T13	Tait has suffered recurrent injuries dating back to 2005 and undergone surgery to his shoulder and elbow.
2064	AFP_ENG_20080129.0608.LDC2009T13	He also has intermittent pain from back and hamstring injuries.
2065	AFP_ENG_20080129.0608.LDC2009T13	"The combination of his injury history and the demands of being an elite professional cricketer has affected his physical, and significantly, his emotional well being," South Australian Cricket Association medical officer Terry Farquharson said.
2066	AFP_ENG_20080129.0608.LDC2009T13	"Shaun feels he needs a rest from cricket and I support this, which will allow him to recover both physically and emotionally."
2067	AFP_ENG_20080129.0608.LDC2009T13	Cricket Australia's Chief medical officer Dr Trefor James said it was clear that Tait needed a break from cricket at all levels.
2068	AFP_ENG_20080129.0608.LDC2009T13	"We'll be working with Shaun going forward to ensure that whatever assistance he requires is provided to him," he said.

2071	AFP_ENG_20080202.0299.LDC2009T13	President Vladimir Putin's favoured successor, Dmitry Medvedev, joined World War II commemorations on Saturday as part of a profile-raising tour a month ahead of March 2 polls.
2072	AFP_ENG_20080202.0299.LDC2009T13	Medvedev laid a wreath at an "eternal flame" that burns in honour of those who died at the Battle of Stalingrad, a turning point in the Soviet Union's monumental struggle against Nazi Germany in World War II, state television showed.
2073	AFP_ENG_20080202.0299.LDC2009T13	The occasion, attended by thousands of veterans in the southern Russian city now named Volgograd, came during a highly publicised country-wide tour by Medvedev, officially conducted in his capacity as first deputy prime minister.
2074	AFP_ENG_20080202.0299.LDC2009T13	"The exploits of Stalingrad are written in gold letters in the history of our fatherland.
2075	AFP_ENG_20080202.0299.LDC2009T13	We must do all we can to ensure their memory lives on and to protect this monument," he was quoted by Interfax as saying at a vast memorial complex.
2076	AFP_ENG_20080202.0299.LDC2009T13	The visit by Medvedev, who is a protege of Putin's and at 42 a child of the 1960s, coincided with the formal start of campaigning in the state media one month ahead of the presidential election.
2077	AFP_ENG_20080202.0299.LDC2009T13	In reality there was almost no sign of what promises to be a tepid official campaign period.
2078	AFP_ENG_20080202.0299.LDC2009T13	State television was to begin its campaign broadcasts and debates on the first working day of the campaign period on Monday, an election commission spokeswoman told AFP.
2079	AFP_ENG_20080202.0299.LDC2009T13	Medvedev has opted not to participate in televised debates, yet as Putin's favoured candidate is expected by analysts to receive blanket coverage of his every move.
2080	AFP_ENG_20080202.0299.LDC2009T13	In the only sign of the official campaign, the state newspaper Rossiyskaya Gazeta carried the programme of Medvedev's United Russia party in eight closely typed columns, concluding: "We consider ourselves continuers of the patriotic tradition of the whole of Russia's 1,000-year statehood."

2090	AFP_ENG_20080205.0168.LDC2009T13	Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe's hopes of cruising to victory at polls next month suffered a severe jolt Tuesday as his respected former finance minister Simba Makoni announced his candidacy.
2091	AFP_ENG_20080205.0168.LDC2009T13	Makoni, a member of the ruling Zimbabwe African National Union - Patriotic Front (ZANU-PF) party, said he would take on Mugabe at the ballot box as an independent in a move analysts said could unite the president's opponents.
2092	AFP_ENG_20080205.0168.LDC2009T13	"Following very extensive and intensive consultations with party members and activists countrywide and also with others outside the party, I have accepted the call and hereby advise the people of Zimbabwe that I offer myself as candidate for the office of president," Makoni told a press conference.
2093	AFP_ENG_20080205.0168.LDC2009T13	"Let me confirm that I share the agony and anguish of all citizens over the extreme hardships that we all have endured for nearly 10 years now," added Makoni who was Mugabe's finance minister from 2000-2003.
2094	AFP_ENG_20080205.0168.LDC2009T13	"I also share the widely held view that these hardships are a result of failure of national leadership and that change at that level is a pre-requisite for change at other levels of national endeavour."
2095	AFP_ENG_20080205.0168.LDC2009T13	Mugabe, who has ruled the former British colony since independence in 1980, is hoping to secure a sixth term in office at joint parliamentary and presidential elections on March 29.
2096	AFP_ENG_20080205.0168.LDC2009T13	Since Makoni left office, Zimbabwe's economy has been in a dramatic downward spiral and it now has an annual inflation rate of more than 26,000 percent, the highest in the world.
2097	AFP_ENG_20080205.0168.LDC2009T13	Unemployment also stands at around 80 percent.
2098	AFP_ENG_20080205.0168.LDC2009T13	But despite the economic woes, the opposition has been in disarray with the two factions of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) party unable to agree on a candidate to take on the soon-to-be 84 Mugabe.
2099	AFP_ENG_20080205.0168.LDC2009T13	Takavafira Zhou, an analyst at Zimbabwe's Masvingo State University, said Makoni would present a stiff challenge, especially if he could attract other disillusioned members of the establishment.
2100	AFP_ENG_20080205.0168.LDC2009T13	"He will pose a real challenge to Mugabe.
2101	AFP_ENG_20080205.0168.LDC2009T13	For the first time Mugabe will have a hard time dealing with opposition from his own ranks," said Zhou.
2102	AFP_ENG_20080205.0168.LDC2009T13	"The move by Makoni could mean the demise of Mugabe, particularly if Makoni can get the support of the Mujurus and the army."
2103	AFP_ENG_20080205.0168.LDC2009T13	Vice President Joyce Mujuru and her husband Solomon Mujuru, a former head of the armed forces, have previously been touted as possible challengers to Mugabe but have been reluctant to break ranks and their stance is seen as critical.
2104	AFP_ENG_20080205.0168.LDC2009T13	The 57-year-old Makoni said he had hoped to have stood as ZANU- PF's official candidate but had been left with no alternative after the party congress endorsed Mugabe at its conference in December.
2105	AFP_ENG_20080205.0168.LDC2009T13	George Katito, a Zimbabwe analyst at the Johannesburg-based South African Institute of International Affairs, said Makoni would face formidable hurdles.
2106	AFP_ENG_20080205.0168.LDC2009T13	"His challenge will breathe new life (into the contest) but whether it's a feasible platform is questionable considering the very strong political machine that Mugabe has run," said Katito.
2107	AFP_ENG_20080205.0168.LDC2009T13	Katito however said Makoni could expect to win over voters who were "disillusioned with the MDC" and saw him as a more credible alternative.
2108	AFP_ENG_20080205.0168.LDC2009T13	Mugabe won the last presidential elections in 2002 in a contest against the MDC's main leader Morgan Tsvangirai but the result was disputed by Western governments which subsequently imposed a package of sanctions.
2109	AFP_ENG_20080205.0168.LDC2009T13	A spokesman for Tsvangirai's faction welcomed the prospect of Makoni running for president while refusing to say whether the MDC would step aside.
2110	AFP_ENG_20080205.0168.LDC2009T13	"A weak and limping ZANU-PF is good news for the opposition and this is most welcome," Nelson Chamisa told AFP.
2111	AFP_ENG_20080205.0168.LDC2009T13	The MDC splinter group led by Tsvangirai's rival Arthur Mutambara also welcomed Makoni's announcement.
2112	AFP_ENG_20080205.0168.LDC2009T13	"We welcome anyone who is willing to fight poverty, hunger and the dictatorship of Robert Mugabe's government," said Gabriel Chaibva.

2115	AFP_ENG_20080301.0119.LDC2009T13	At least 50 Palestinians, including at least 13 civilians, were killed in a massive air and ground incursion in northern Gaza, said Dr Muawiya Hassanein, head of Gaza's emergency services.
2116	AFP_ENG_20080301.0119.LDC2009T13	More than 150 people were wounded in the northern operation, Hassanein said.
2117	AFP_ENG_20080301.0119.LDC2009T13	At least 16 of the Palestinians killed were militants: 13 fighters from the Islamist movement Hamas which controls Gaza, two from Islamic Jihad, and one from the Popular Resistance Committees.
2118	AFP_ENG_20080301.0119.LDC2009T13	Two Israeli soldiers were also killed in the latest fighting, and another seven wounded, including two officers, the army said, reporting its first deaths since the violence escalated on Wednesday.
2119	AFP_ENG_20080301.0119.LDC2009T13	Another two Palestinians were killed in an air strike on a police station in the southern town of Khan Yunis, medics said.
2120	AFP_ENG_20080301.0119.LDC2009T13	The main operation was launched before dawn when Israeli tanks supported by helicopters pushed into the town and refugee camp of Jabaliya in the northern Gaza Strip and continued the assault throughout the day.
2121	AFP_ENG_20080301.0119.LDC2009T13	At least 287 people have been killed since Israel and the Palestinians relaunched formal peace talks at a US conference in November, the vast majority of them Gaza militants, according to an AFP count.
2122	AFP_ENG_20080301.0119.LDC2009T13	Since the Palestinian uprising erupted in September 2000, at least 6,248 people have been killed, with Palestinians making up the vast majority, according to an AFP tally.

2125	AFP_ENG_20080305.0322.LDC2009T13	The informal three-day meeting from Thursday comes as Japanese whalers are locked in a struggle with conservation activists who threw acid at crew members of a ship participating in Japan's annual whale hunt in the Southern Ocean.
2126	AFP_ENG_20080305.0322.LDC2009T13	Japan was enraged by Monday's attack and said it would raise the incident at the meeting.
2127	AFP_ENG_20080305.0322.LDC2009T13	Foreign Minister Masahiko Komura said it was "not permissible to use violence to try to force through one's opinion."
2128	AFP_ENG_20080305.0322.LDC2009T13	The London meeting was called by IWC Chairman William Hogarth in a bid to break the impasse between its pro- and anti-whaling blocs.
2129	AFP_ENG_20080305.0322.LDC2009T13	Hogarth, an American, helped persuade Japan last year to suspend its plans to kill humpback whales for the first time in four decades.
2130	AFP_ENG_20080305.0322.LDC2009T13	Japan says whaling is part of its culture and kills up to 1,000 whales a year, exploiting a loophole in a 1986 global moratorium that allows "lethal research" on the giant mammals, although the meat ends up in supermarkets.
2131	AFP_ENG_20080305.0322.LDC2009T13	Australia has stepped up its opposition to whaling under new Prime Minister Kevin Rudd and has sent a ship to monitor the Japanese mission, but Canberra condemned the activists' attack and appealed for restraint from both sides.
2132	AFP_ENG_20080305.0322.LDC2009T13	The agenda of the meeting says the IWC has called in Professor Calestous Juma of Harvard University, who has experience "in handling difficult international issues," to try to broker an agreement between the pro- and anti-whaling lobbies.

2135	AFP_ENG_20080306.0290.LDC2009T13	A French court ruling Thursday paved the way for a possible US trial over a 2004 charter aircraft crash in Egypt that killed 134 French tourists, focusing on the responsibility of US planemaker Boeing.
2136	AFP_ENG_20080306.0290.LDC2009T13	The Paris court of appeal ruled in favour of families of the victims of the crash off the Red Sea resort of Sharm-el-Sheikh, who argued the civil case fell outside French jurisdiction and should be tried in the United States.
2137	AFP_ENG_20080306.0290.LDC2009T13	A lower court had rejected the families' arguments in June 2006.
2138	AFP_ENG_20080306.0290.LDC2009T13	"This opens the door for the case to return to the United States," said Denis Chemla, lawyer for US aeronautics supplier Honeywell, who said he would study the ruling before deciding whether to file a higher appeal.
2139	AFP_ENG_20080306.0290.LDC2009T13	Honeywell is one of four US companies targeted by the victims' attorneys, along with Boeing, IFLC the owner of the plane, and Parker Hannifin, maker of hydraulic equipment.
2140	AFP_ENG_20080306.0290.LDC2009T13	Separate French and Egyptian probes into the January 2004 crash of the Boeing 737 aircraft, which killed 148 people including 134 French tourists, failed to establish any responsibility on the planemaker's behalf.
2141	AFP_ENG_20080306.0290.LDC2009T13	But the families of the victims argue that moving the civil part of the trial to the United States would "inevitably bring to light manufacturing faults" in the aircraft.

2155	AFP_ENG_20080313.0360.LDC2009T13	Police inspector general Kishan Kumar told a news conference that Scarlett Keeling, 15, was fed with a deadly cocktail of drugs, raped by one of the men and then left for dead on the Anjuna beach tourist spot.
2156	AFP_ENG_20080313.0360.LDC2009T13	The two suspects were named as local barman Samson D'Souza, 29, and Placido Carvalho, an alleged drugs dealer working the beaches of the former Portuguese colony.

2158	AFP_ENG_20080313.0360.LDC2009T13	Keeling then fainted and died of a combination of exhaustion, assault and the drugs fed to her by the two men, he said.
2159	AFP_ENG_20080313.0360.LDC2009T13	Although Carvalho was not present when she died, he was also charged with murder because of "common intention," Kumar said.
2160	AFP_ENG_20080313.0360.LDC2009T13	Keeling's bruised and partially naked body was found on the beach more than three weeks ago.
2161	AFP_ENG_20080313.0360.LDC2009T13	Police had initially insisted the girl had drowned in the Arabian Sea, but a second autopsy demanded by Keeling's mother, 43-year- old Fiona MacKeown, prompted the murder investigation.

2203	AFP_ENG_20080319.0687.LDC2009T13	Last odyssey for sci-fi guru Arthur C. Clarke
2204	AFP_ENG_20080319.0687.LDC2009T13	Science fiction author Arthur C. Clarke, who died Wednesday aged 90, captured the world's imagination with his vision of the future in books such as "2001: A Space Odyssey" and predicted communication satellites.
2205	AFP_ENG_20080319.0687.LDC2009T13	Born in Britain, Clarke had lived in Sri Lanka for more than half a century, holed up in an "electronic cottage" from which he communicated with the world via a battery of monitors, radios and computer keyboards.
2206	AFP_ENG_20080319.0687.LDC2009T13	Clarke was knighted by Britain's Queen Elizabeth in 1998 in recognition of his status as the grand old man of science fiction.
2207	AFP_ENG_20080319.0687.LDC2009T13	After a diverse career as a writer, underwater explorer, space promoter and science populariser, Clarke said he would like to be remembered primarily as a writer and wished for peace in his adopted home Sri Lanka where had lived since 1956.
2208	AFP_ENG_20080319.0687.LDC2009T13	"I want to be remembered most as a writer -- one who entertained readers, and, hopefully, stretched their imagination as well," Clarke said in December.
2209	AFP_ENG_20080319.0687.LDC2009T13	Just a few days before he died, Clarke reviewed the final manuscript of his latest novel, "The Last Theorem" co-written with American author Frederik Pohl, which is to be published later this year.
2210	AFP_ENG_20080319.0687.LDC2009T13	"The Last Theorem has taken a lot longer than I expected.
2211	AFP_ENG_20080319.0687.LDC2009T13	That could well be my last novel, but then I've said that before," Clarke said last year.
2212	AFP_ENG_20080319.0687.LDC2009T13	Clarke wanted to be allowed three wishes.
2213	AFP_ENG_20080319.0687.LDC2009T13	As well as peace in Sri Lanka, he hoped for evidence of extra-terrestrial life and for the world to adopt cleaner fuels.
2214	AFP_ENG_20080319.0687.LDC2009T13	"I have no regrets and no more personal ambitions," he said at his 90th birthday even as he was confined to a wheelchair over the past three decades because of the effects of childhood polio.
2215	AFP_ENG_20080319.0687.LDC2009T13	Though indissociably linked with the filmmaker Stanley Kubrick, with whom he wrote the novel and screenplay of the cult classic "2001: A Space Odyssey", Clarke first made his mark with a visionary paper written during World War II in which he worked out the conditions for placing geostationary satellites in orbit.
2216	AFP_ENG_20080319.0687.LDC2009T13	He was paid 15 pounds for a theory that launched an industry than can now be measured in billions of dollars.
2217	AFP_ENG_20080319.0687.LDC2009T13	"People say I could have made a lot of money if I applied for a patent," Clarke said.
2218	AFP_ENG_20080319.0687.LDC2009T13	"I did not get a patent because I never thought it will happen in my life time."
2219	AFP_ENG_20080319.0687.LDC2009T13	Born to farming parents on December 16, 1917 at Minehead in the west of England (he retained his Somerset burr to the end of his life), Clarke was only 12 when he developed an interest in science fiction after reading the March 1930 issue of the US sci- fi magazine Amazing Stories.
2220	AFP_ENG_20080319.0687.LDC2009T13	He became an early member of the British Interplanetary Society, a group of dreamers who met to discuss ways of putting a man on the moon, performed war service as an RAF lieutenant working in radar, and acquired a postwar physics and maths degree from King's College, London.
2221	AFP_ENG_20080319.0687.LDC2009T13	And in 1950 began writing books.
2222	AFP_ENG_20080319.0687.LDC2009T13	His first efforts were non-fiction, involving early descriptions of space flight.
2223	AFP_ENG_20080319.0687.LDC2009T13	But in 1953 he received rave reviews for "Childhood's End", his fifth science-fiction novel, and was freed financially pursue his other love, and the subject of a dozen of his later books, underwater exploration.
2224	AFP_ENG_20080319.0687.LDC2009T13	That brought him to Sri Lanka (then Ceylon) where he settled (though remaining a British citizen) in the 1950s, setting up a diving school at Hikkaduwa, down the coast from Colombo.
2225	AFP_ENG_20080319.0687.LDC2009T13	He also spent several months a year living in New York, and it was there that he met Kubrick, who was keen on making a science- fiction movie.
2226	AFP_ENG_20080319.0687.LDC2009T13	The idea for "2001" was born of a meeting in Trader Vic's bar, the filmmaker requiring Clarke to write out a full-length novel before they worked on a script.
2227	AFP_ENG_20080319.0687.LDC2009T13	The film met mixed critical reviews initially, but soon established itself as a classic of the genre.
2228	AFP_ENG_20080319.0687.LDC2009T13	Clarke himself regarded it as one of the three great achievements of his life, along with the satellite paper and the lead he gave for the television series "Star Trek".
2229	AFP_ENG_20080319.0687.LDC2009T13	Despite his specialist knowledge and visionary status, Clarke had an uneasy relationship with the scientific establishment, and many of his technical papers were published in Playboy magazine.
2230	AFP_ENG_20080319.0687.LDC2009T13	Among the "extrapolations" he made for the future (he avoided the word predictions), Clarke envisaged mankind making contact with intelligent life on other planets by 2030 and discovering the secret of immortality by 2090 -- probably "electronic immortality, with all sorts of good results, and some bad results."
2231	AFP_ENG_20080319.0687.LDC2009T13	Keeping up a punishing work routine into his eighties, Clarke wrote three sequels to "2001", the last in 1997, entitled "3001: The Final Odyssey".
2232	AFP_ENG_20080319.0687.LDC2009T13	Living in Sri Lanka as a "failed recluse", he was granted unique tax-free status after he persuaded the authorities to enact the Resident Guest Scheme (popularly known as "the Arthur Clarke law") permitting prominent foreigners who bring in hard currency to enjoy minimal taxes and a variety of perks.
2233	AFP_ENG_20080319.0687.LDC2009T13	"He is a national asset for Sri Lanka," President Mahinda Rajapakse said at Clarke's 90th birthday bash in Colombo.
2234	AFP_ENG_20080319.0687.LDC2009T13	Clarke enjoyed the company of the famous, and his home was lined with photographs of his meetings with the late Pope John Paul II, or with astronaut Neil Armstrong, or with Prince Charles who travelled to Colombo to confer his knighthood on him.
2235	AFP_ENG_20080319.0687.LDC2009T13	The ceremony was postponed amid unsubstantiated allegations of paedophilia in the British media based on unguarded remarks Clarke made to two visiting journalists.
2236	AFP_ENG_20080319.0687.LDC2009T13	Clarke vigorously rejected the allegations.
2237	AFP_ENG_20080319.0687.LDC2009T13	In 1953, Clarke married Marilyn Mayfield, an American divorcee, but separated six months later.

2239	AFP_ENG_20080320.0192.LDC2009T13	Cedrick Wilson, a receiver with seven years of National Football League experience, was dropped by the Pittsburgh Steelers on Thursday, a day after he was arrested in a bar incident.
2240	AFP_ENG_20080320.0192.LDC2009T13	Wilson was charged with assault, harassment and disorderly conduct after allegedly hitting his former girlfriend Wednesday night.
2241	AFP_ENG_20080320.0192.LDC2009T13	He was arraigned and released on 10,000 dollars bail.
2242	AFP_ENG_20080320.0192.LDC2009T13	Police said witnesses saw Wilson enter the bar, walk to the seat of Lindsey Paulat, the 26-year-old mother of his one-year-old daughter, and tap her on the shoulder before hitting her on the left side of her face.
2243	AFP_ENG_20080320.0192.LDC2009T13	Paulat is awaiting a hearing on firearm charges after a 12-hour standoff with police on January 19.
2244	AFP_ENG_20080320.0192.LDC2009T13	After an argument with Wilson, she allegedly fired two gunshots in his house.
2245	AFP_ENG_20080320.0192.LDC2009T13	Wilson, 29, applied for a protection from abuse order two days later, saying he feared she would shoot him.
2246	AFP_ENG_20080320.0192.LDC2009T13	Wilson played in 16 games for the Steelers last season, catching 18 passes for 207 yards and a touchdown.

2249	AFP_ENG_20080320.0372.LDC2009T13	French coach Raymond Domenech has called up four new faces into his 39-strong squad for full and A internationals against England and Mali next week.
2250	AFP_ENG_20080320.0372.LDC2009T13	Lyon midfielder Mathieu Bodmer, exciting Marseille striker Mathieu Valbuena, and defenders Mathieu Delpierre (Stuttgart) and Adil Rami (Lille) all make the enlarged squad for the March 25 and 26 games at Stade Charlety and the Stade de France respectively.
2251	AFP_ENG_20080320.0372.LDC2009T13	The games offer the last chance for players to impress on the international stage before the squad announcement for Euro 2008 in early May.
2252	AFP_ENG_20080320.0372.LDC2009T13	Two notable omissions were those of Bayern Munich defender Willy Sagnol, who was on the bench in Saturday Bundesliga action but whom Domenech described as injured, and Juventus striker David Trezeguet.
2253	AFP_ENG_20080320.0372.LDC2009T13	Trezeguet, who has winners medals from the 1998 World Cup and Euro 2000, has said he has no interest in playing for the A team, but Domenech insisted the door was not closed to the striker and that he remained an "interesting option".
2254	AFP_ENG_20080320.0372.LDC2009T13	"We must try to see some options for the future," Domenech added of his call- ups.
2255	AFP_ENG_20080320.0372.LDC2009T13	"Some players in certain positions will call a halt to their careers quicker than others, so we mustn't find ourselves in a situation where one generation leaves and we are left having to urgently find replacements for them.
2256	AFP_ENG_20080320.0372.LDC2009T13	"We want to see where they are, what they're capable of doing at the highest level," he said.

2263	AFP_ENG_20080325.0479.LDC2009T13	Dubai-based Emirates Airlines may buy Japan's first passenger jet airplane, which is being developed by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd., a report said Tuesday.
2264	AFP_ENG_20080325.0479.LDC2009T13	The carrier is in talks with the Japanese company about the possible purchase of the Mitsubishi Regional Jet, which will seat 70 to 90 passengers, Kyodo News reported, quoting an unnamed source familiar with the matter.
2265	AFP_ENG_20080325.0479.LDC2009T13	Vietnam Airlines for its part is considering buying about 20 of the jets, while US and European carriers are also showing interest in the plane, which could enter service in 2012, it said.
2266	AFP_ENG_20080325.0479.LDC2009T13	Japan's All Nippon Airways has also said it was considering buying the new fuel- efficient regional plane if it is built.
2267	AFP_ENG_20080325.0479.LDC2009T13	Japan Airlines has also reportedly shown interest in the jet, which is billed as the most quiet, light and fuel-efficient model in its class.
2268	AFP_ENG_20080325.0479.LDC2009T13	If it becomes a reality, the aircraft would be the first commercial passenger aircraft in four decades -- and the first ever jet airplane -- to be built in Japan.

2274	AFP_ENG_20080327.0663.LDC2009T13	Prem Tinasulanond, head of the Privy Council, said he was not concerned that he might become a target for political retribution by the new government, who took power after winning elections in December.

2276	AFP_ENG_20080327.0663.LDC2009T13	"I am not involved in politics or anything related to politics."
2277	AFP_ENG_20080327.0663.LDC2009T13	Thaksin's allies have accused Prem, a former prime minister who is widely seen as the public voice of Thailand's revered King Bhumibol Adulyadej, of masterminding the putsch in September 2006.

2280	AFP_ENG_20080331.0536.LDC2009T13	Bangladesh looks to India rice imports to ease price crunch
2281	AFP_ENG_20080331.0536.LDC2009T13	Bangladesh will import 400,000 tonnes of rice from India by the end of May to sell below cost on the open market in a bid to ease spiralling prices, an official said Monday.
2282	AFP_ENG_20080331.0536.LDC2009T13	The move comes amid reports that people have begun stockpiling rice due to rocketing prices, which have doubled in the past year and prompted a former government minister to warn of a "silent famine" in the south Asian country.
2283	AFP_ENG_20080331.0536.LDC2009T13	Bangladesh will pay 430 dollars per tonne for delivery of the rice from India in the next two months, food secretary Molla Wahiduzzaman said.
2284	AFP_ENG_20080331.0536.LDC2009T13	The shipments will boost the total amount of subsidised rice available at government-run shops to 120,000 tonnes in April -- nearly triple what had been on offer before, Wahiduzzaman said.
2285	AFP_ENG_20080331.0536.LDC2009T13	Government outlets sell rice at 25 taka (36 cents) a kilogramme, around 40 percent less than the market rate.
2286	AFP_ENG_20080331.0536.LDC2009T13	Bangladesh and other Asian nations have been hit by record costs for imported oil and food in the past year, which threatens to hobble rapid export-oriented economic growth.
2287	AFP_ENG_20080331.0536.LDC2009T13	Rising food prices are a big concern for most people in Bangladesh, where about 40 percent live on less than a dollar a day and poor households spend nearly 70 percent of their income on food.
2288	AFP_ENG_20080331.0536.LDC2009T13	Annual food inflation reached 16 percent in December here after massive floods in July and August, and Cyclone Sidr in November, which devastated rice and other crops.
2289	AFP_ENG_20080331.0536.LDC2009T13	The military-backed government, which came to power in January 2007, said the country would need to import more than three million tonnes in the current financial year ending June because of the crop damages.
2290	AFP_ENG_20080331.0536.LDC2009T13	Wahiduzzaman however said the imports from India were a buffer and not an attempt to ease a food shortage, as the country has a three-month stockpile on hand.
2291	AFP_ENG_20080331.0536.LDC2009T13	But government shops have stepped up subsidised sales of rice in the main cities to meet soaring demand.
2292	AFP_ENG_20080331.0536.LDC2009T13	Independent economist Zaid Bakht said the government intervention was "too little, too late" as people have started to hoard rice fearing further price hikes.
2293	AFP_ENG_20080331.0536.LDC2009T13	"The government says it has enough stocks for the next three months.
2294	AFP_ENG_20080331.0536.LDC2009T13	Yet, the queues in front of government open-market sales centres have been growing larger and larger.
2295	AFP_ENG_20080331.0536.LDC2009T13	Some of the queues are almost as long as a mile," he said.
2296	AFP_ENG_20080331.0536.LDC2009T13	"The magnitude and the intensity of the situation is severe.
2297	AFP_ENG_20080331.0536.LDC2009T13	Tens of millions of poor people have to cut their daily food intake or are going hungry, as the food prices in the market are beyond their reach," he said.
2298	AFP_ENG_20080331.0536.LDC2009T13	United Nations official Kemal Dervis, who visited the country earlier this month, urged rich nations to increase food and monetary aid to Bangladesh as it struggles to cope with rocketing prices.

2300	AFP_ENG_20080401.5035.LDC2009T13	Cricket: WIndies looking to put positive spin on test team
2301	AFP_ENG_20080401.5035.LDC2009T13	Stories of the ill-treatment of spin bowlers at the hands of the West Indies selectors over the years are notorious.
2302	AFP_ENG_20080401.5035.LDC2009T13	Since Lance Gibbs ended his distinguished career on February 5, 1976, West Indies cricket history is littered with several bowlers plying the slow stuff that have been tossed aside in preference for bowlers living in the "fast lane".
2303	AFP_ENG_20080401.5035.LDC2009T13	Truth be told, though, West Indies - who face Sri Lanka here in the second Test on Thursday - have only produced three World- class spin bowlers in the eight decades since their entry into Test cricket - and this number may be stretched to four when Garfield Sobers is included on the list.
2304	AFP_ENG_20080401.5035.LDC2009T13	Gibbs has been the most successful with a former world record 309 wickets at 29.09 apiece in 79 Tests, fellow off-spinner Sonny Ramadhin snared 158 at an average of 28.98 in 43 Tests, and left- arm spinner Alf Valentine snared 139 at 30.32 each in 36 Tests.
2305	AFP_ENG_20080401.5035.LDC2009T13	Sobers took 235 wickets at an average of 34.03 in 93 Tests - bowling principally either left-arm orthodox or chinaman - but some of his scalps were taken when he transformed himself into a left-arm fast-medium bowler.
2306	AFP_ENG_20080401.5035.LDC2009T13	But West Indies have languished behind the other Test-playing nations of the World in the deployment of spin bowlers in their attack, even after the rules of the game were changed to render their feared battery of fast bowlers toothless in the 1990s.
2307	AFP_ENG_20080401.5035.LDC2009T13	The crescendo of noise for spin bowlers to gain recognition at the highest level of the game has escalated, particularly in the face of the friendly fire produced by the modern-day armoury of West Indies fast bowlers, and the continued success of the slower bowlers in domestic competitions at all levels.
2308	AFP_ENG_20080401.5035.LDC2009T13	The selection of the beanpole left-arm spin bowler Sulieman Benn for the opening Test of two against Sri Lanka last week at the Guyana National Stadium has given hope that the selectors may finally be getting the message.
2309	AFP_ENG_20080401.5035.LDC2009T13	Benn conceded 120 runs from 40 overs in the first innings without success, and he collected three scalps in the second innings when the Sri Lankans were chasing quick runs, but leaked almost five runs-an-over - hardly evidence that suggests greatness.
2310	AFP_ENG_20080401.5035.LDC2009T13	But West Indies coach John Dyson believes it was satisfactory, and seems prepared to give him a chance in the second Test.
2311	AFP_ENG_20080401.5035.LDC2009T13	"In assessing his performance, you have got to say that the pitch was a batsman's paradise," Dyson said.
2312	AFP_ENG_20080401.5035.LDC2009T13	"It didn't help the fast bowlers, and it didn't help the spinners, and I thought he bowled very, very well for his first Test match.
2313	AFP_ENG_20080401.5035.LDC2009T13	He came in, maintained a good line, a good length.

2316	AFP_ENG_20080401.5035.LDC2009T13	It's hard to recall when a West Indies selection panel made such a bold move, and it was a throwback to when a similar combination of spin bowlers Ramadhin and Valentine were given their break on the 1950 tour of England.
2317	AFP_ENG_20080401.5035.LDC2009T13	"I said before the match that it is good that we have frontline spinners in the squad because it gives us that option that when you get a pitch that might actually be kind to spinners to actually play one," said Dyson.

2322	AFP_ENG_20080406.0210.LDC2009T13	Inter Milan, who had seen their once seemingly invincible 11-point Serie A lead whittled down to just one, stopped the rot on Sunday with a 2-0 win at Atalanta to go four points clear with six games left.
2323	AFP_ENG_20080406.0210.LDC2009T13	Inter were under pressure having won only two of their last nine matches in all competitions and being knocked out of the Champions League.
2324	AFP_ENG_20080406.0210.LDC2009T13	On Saturday, they had seen AS Roma beat Genoa 3-2 which left them with a slender one-point advantage to take to Atalanta who enjoyed an impressive 2-1 victory at AC Milan last week.
2325	AFP_ENG_20080406.0210.LDC2009T13	But Inter responded in style and shrugged off the inury-enforced absences of Zlatan Ibrahimovic and David Suazo to take the victory.
2326	AFP_ENG_20080406.0210.LDC2009T13	French international skipper Patrick Vieira headed the defending champions into a 21st-minute lead despite protests by Atalanta that their defender Massimiliano Pellegrino had been impeded.

2328	AFP_ENG_20080406.0210.LDC2009T13	The win was Inter's first in four matches following two draws and a defeat and represented their first victory away from the San Siro since February 10.
2329	AFP_ENG_20080406.0210.LDC2009T13	"Roma's wins didn't worry us," said Inter coach Roberto Mancini.
2330	AFP_ENG_20080406.0210.LDC2009T13	"Generally speaking, titles are won with a one or two-point difference.
2331	AFP_ENG_20080406.0210.LDC2009T13	Now there are fewer and fewer matches to play to play and we have a four-point lead.

2337	AFP_ENG_20080406.0210.LDC2009T13	However, a Daniele De Rossi penalty 10 minutes from time secured the three points which will send Roma to Manchester next week for their Champions League quarter-final second leg clash in good heart.
2338	AFP_ENG_20080406.0210.LDC2009T13	"We proved that we have real heart," said Roma coach Luciano Spalletti.
2339	AFP_ENG_20080406.0210.LDC2009T13	"The result was deserved.
2340	AFP_ENG_20080406.0210.LDC2009T13	We struggled, but Genoa play good football and are in great shape, so that was only to be expected."
2341	AFP_ENG_20080406.0210.LDC2009T13	Roma, still without injured talismanic skipper Francesco Totti, were in front after 14 minutes when Brazilian import Taddei scored from a cross by Max Tonnetto.

2344	AFP_ENG_20080406.0210.LDC2009T13	Honduran international Julio Cesar Leon then levelled at 2-2 just moments later.
2345	AFP_ENG_20080406.0210.LDC2009T13	But just as Genoa threatened to clinch the three points, Roma were handed a lifeline when Borriello brought down Taddei and De Rossi converted the penalty.
2346	AFP_ENG_20080406.0210.LDC2009T13	AC Milan kept up their push for Champions League qualification with a 3-1 win over relegation-threatened Cagliari.

2360	AFP_ENG_20080410.0187.LDC2009T13	Police investigating claims that French businesses for years secretly funded their trade union adversaries on Thursday raided the Paris headquarters of the country's top employers' federation.The Medef federation issued a statement saying it was "cooperating fully with legal authorities to help them shed light on the UIMM (metal and mining lobby) affair."
2361	AFP_ENG_20080410.0187.LDC2009T13	The powerful UIMM, a member of Medef, has been under police investigation after it was revealed that some 19 million euros (30 million dollars) in cash had been withdrawn from UIMM accounts since 2000.
2362	AFP_ENG_20080410.0187.LDC2009T13	A source close to the probe said Thursday that the investigators were in particular looking for emails between the Medef chief Laurence Parisot and other Medef members concerning the system of UIMM cash withdrawals.
2363	AFP_ENG_20080410.0187.LDC2009T13	The raid came a day after a former president of the UIMM, Daniel Dewavrin, was placed under investigation in the affair.
2364	AFP_ENG_20080410.0187.LDC2009T13	Dewavrin said in March that Parisot had been informed about the cash withdrawals, but she has denied that.
2365	AFP_ENG_20080410.0187.LDC2009T13	A Medef official, Hugues-Arnaud Meyer, on Thursday told journalists gathered outside the Medef building that "we have nothing to hide" and that "everyone knows that Laurence Parisot was not informed" of the withdrawals.
2366	AFP_ENG_20080410.0187.LDC2009T13	The UIMM's head Denis Gautier-Sauvagnac was forced to step down and placed under investigation over the revelation in September that millions had been withdrawn.
2367	AFP_ENG_20080410.0187.LDC2009T13	Investigators believe they have stumbled on hidden "war-funds" used by the century-old metals federation to subsidise trade unions and "buy" agreements to end industrial disputes, in an arrangement stretching back decades.
2368	AFP_ENG_20080410.0187.LDC2009T13	They are also looking into suggestions of illicit political party funding, with the questioning in February of a former intelligence chief who alleged the UIMM helped pay for Valery Giscard d'Estaing's presidential campaign in 1974.
2369	AFP_ENG_20080410.0187.LDC2009T13	Shock over the revelations turned to outrage when it emerged that the UIMM offered its disgraced ex-boss Gautier-Sauvagnac a 1.5 million euro severance package.
2370	AFP_ENG_20080410.0187.LDC2009T13	The affair has led to a fierce battle of wills between would-be reformers and a powerful industrial old guard.
2371	AFP_ENG_20080410.0187.LDC2009T13	It pits Parisot against the UIMM, Medef's most powerful branch, whose 45,000 members include the carmaker Peugeot Citroen and the nuclear giant Areva.
2372	AFP_ENG_20080410.0234.LDC2009T13	Football: Liverpool co-owner Hicks wants Parry out - report
2373	AFP_ENG_20080410.0234.LDC2009T13	Liverpool were plunged into fresh turmoil Thursday when, according to a report on Sky Sports television, American co-owner Tom Hicks demanded the resignation of chief executive Rick Parry.It is understood a letter containing a request for Parry's removal arrived at Anfield just two days after Liverpool beat English rivals Arsenal 4-2 in dramatic fashion to go through to the semi-finals of the Champions League.
2374	AFP_ENG_20080410.0234.LDC2009T13	Liverpool already had a split at the top of the club after George Gillett, their other American co-owner, revealed his relationship with Hicks had long broken down.
2375	AFP_ENG_20080410.0234.LDC2009T13	But with both men owning 50 percent of the club each, it is hard to see how Parry, who has been Liverpool's chief executive for 10 years, can be forced out unless Gillett and Hicks agree on his departure.
2376	AFP_ENG_20080410.0234.LDC2009T13	Parry, in an interview with the BBC last month, called on the feuding co-owners to end their differences, saying one of them had to sell up.
2377	AFP_ENG_20080410.0234.LDC2009T13	"The hope will be that it's resolved quickly now, it's dragged on for long enough and the ideal would be to move to as speedy a resolution as possible."
2378	AFP_ENG_20080410.0234.LDC2009T13	Parry added: "All things are possible at the moment - somebody's got to sell, that's clear.
2379	AFP_ENG_20080410.0234.LDC2009T13	If they're not able to co-exist then there needs to be a solution where one buys and one sells, or both sell.
2380	AFP_ENG_20080410.0234.LDC2009T13	"It's pretty clear that to carry on with the status quo is going to be extremely difficult."
2381	AFP_ENG_20080410.0234.LDC2009T13	Parry was the prime mover in bringing Gillett to the club 18 months ago, with the American teaming up with Hicks for financial support.
2382	AFP_ENG_20080410.0234.LDC2009T13	Dubai Investment Capital, a group bankrolled by the ruling royal family of the United Arab Emirates, have been eyeing a bid for Liverpool.
2383	AFP_ENG_20080410.0234.LDC2009T13	But DIC chief execuitve Sameer Al Ansari admitted that while they would "still love to own" Liverpool and will "continue to be interested" in the club, no deal was possible until Gillett and Hicks resolved their differences.
2384	AFP_ENG_20080410.0234.LDC2009T13	"You have two partners who do not see eye to eye.
2385	AFP_ENG_20080410.0234.LDC2009T13	And we decided that we pull out completely.
2386	AFP_ENG_20080410.0234.LDC2009T13	Let them sort out their problems," Ansari told Thursday's Liverpool Echo.
2387	AFP_ENG_20080410.0234.LDC2009T13	According to the Echo, DIC was prepared to pay in the region of 510 million pounds (1.02 billion dollars) for the club.
2388	AFP_ENG_20080410.0234.LDC2009T13	That would have given Gillett and Hicks an estimate profit of 40 million pounds (80 million dollars each).
2389	AFP_ENG_20080410.0234.LDC2009T13	But Hicks refused to sell and has since been trying to buy-out Gillett.
2390	AFP_ENG_20080410.0234.LDC2009T13	However, Gillett has made it clear he doesn't want to sell to Hicks.
2391	AFP_ENG_20080410.0234.LDC2009T13	Al Ansari added: "We will continue to be interested and would love to own the club but we are not going to put ourselves in a difficult situation where we make the investment but we have no control over the destiny of the club and we cannot influence the success of the club.
2392	AFP_ENG_20080410.0234.LDC2009T13	"Unfortunately, the terms that have been put on the table do not allow us to do that."

2440	AFP_ENG_20080421.0423.LDC2009T13	At least 60 Myanmar immigrants rioted in a Malaysia detention centre Monday, torching a building after failing to win asylum to a third country, according to a news report.The group initially gathered outside their block at a detention camp south of here and tried to bring down the perimeter fence, local state police chief Osman Abdullah was quoted as saying by the daily Star newspaper website.
2441	AFP_ENG_20080421.0423.LDC2009T13	"The authorities tried talking to them but a short while later, they turned violent and then gained entry into the office and set it ablaze," he added.
2442	AFP_ENG_20080421.0423.LDC2009T13	Osman said about 200 police and security personnel were deployed to bring the situation under control.
2443	AFP_ENG_20080421.0423.LDC2009T13	The Lenggeng detention facility houses 820 illegal immigrants, of which 218 are from Myanmar, he said.
2444	AFP_ENG_20080421.0423.LDC2009T13	"We are still investigating the cause, but at this point in time all I can say is that they were unhappy because they heard that their application to a third country had been rejected," Osman added.

2447	AFP_ENG_20080421.0551.LDC2009T13	It turns out that dull tasks really do numb the brain.Researchers have discovered that as people perform monotonous tasks, their brain shifts towards an at-rest mode whether they like it or not.
2448	AFP_ENG_20080421.0551.LDC2009T13	And by monitoring that area of the brain, they were able to predict when someone was about to make a mistake before they made it, a study published Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences found.
2449	AFP_ENG_20080421.0551.LDC2009T13	"There's this thing that's probably intrinsic where your brain says I do need to take a little break here and there's nothing you can do about it," said study author Tom Eichele of Norway's University of Bergen.
2450	AFP_ENG_20080421.0551.LDC2009T13	"Probably everyone knows that feeling that sometimes your brain is not as receptive or as well performing and you didn't do anything to actually induce that."
2451	AFP_ENG_20080421.0551.LDC2009T13	When that happens, blood flows into the part of the brain which is more active in states of rest.
2452	AFP_ENG_20080421.0551.LDC2009T13	And since this state begins about 30 seconds prior to a mistake being made, it could be possible to design an early-warning system which could alert people to be more focused or more careful, Eichele said.
2453	AFP_ENG_20080421.0551.LDC2009T13	That could significantly improve workplace safety and also improve performance in key tasks such as airport security screening.
2454	AFP_ENG_20080421.0551.LDC2009T13	"We might be able to build a device (that could be placed) on the heads of people that make these easy decisions," he told AFP.
2455	AFP_ENG_20080421.0551.LDC2009T13	"We can measure the signal and give feedback to the user that well, your brain is in the state where your decisions are not going to be the right one."
2456	AFP_ENG_20080421.0551.LDC2009T13	Eichele and his colleagues in the United States, Britain and Germany were able to detect these brain patterns with MRI scans, which are not portable.
2457	AFP_ENG_20080421.0551.LDC2009T13	The next step is to see if more mobile EEG devices are able to detect the phenomenon.
2458	AFP_ENG_20080421.0551.LDC2009T13	A prototype of a wireless, mobile, and lightweight EEG amplifier is currently in development and could be ready for the market in 10 to 15 years, he said.

2468	AFP_ENG_20080426.0409.LDC2009T13	Three people were bitten by a rabies-infected puppy dog in British quarantine, a Health Protection Agency (HPA) spokeswoman said Saturday.The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) announced that a case of rabies had been confirmed in the puppy.
2469	AFP_ENG_20080426.0409.LDC2009T13	The dog died Thursday and had been held in quarantine in south- east England since April 18 after being brought into Britain from Sri Lanka.
2470	AFP_ENG_20080426.0409.LDC2009T13	The last human death from indigenous classical rabies in Britain occurred in 1902, while the disease was eradicated from the island kingdom in 1922.
2471	AFP_ENG_20080426.0409.LDC2009T13	Officials said Britain remained rabies-free and the risk of it spreading was highly unlikely, while those bitten required swift treatment.
2472	AFP_ENG_20080426.0409.LDC2009T13	"This animal died whilst in quarantine, which has effectively contained any public health risk," said Doctor Dilys Morgan, an HPA rabies expert.
2473	AFP_ENG_20080426.0409.LDC2009T13	"We understand that three individuals connected to the quarantine centre and rescue centre were bitten by the animal and all have received or will be receiving prompt protective treatment with appropriate vaccination.
2474	AFP_ENG_20080426.0409.LDC2009T13	"Even if someone has been bitten by an animal with rabies, prompt post-exposure treatment following the bite is highly effective in preventing rabies."
2475	AFP_ENG_20080426.0409.LDC2009T13	Checks were underway on animals which might have come into contact with the puppy, Defra said, including those which have since left the centre.
2476	AFP_ENG_20080426.0409.LDC2009T13	A full investigation is underway.
2477	AFP_ENG_20080426.0409.LDC2009T13	"While initial tests show that this puppy has tested positive for rabies, this shows that the system is working and the case has been picked up while the animal is in quarantine," said Acting Chief Veterinary Officer Alick Simmons.
2478	AFP_ENG_20080426.0409.LDC2009T13	"This means it is contained and the UK's rabies free status remains in place.
2479	AFP_ENG_20080426.0409.LDC2009T13	"We are now tracing animals that have moved from the kennels to ensure that all animals that have come into contact with the puppy are monitored.
2480	AFP_ENG_20080426.0409.LDC2009T13	"However, any risk of the disease having spread to other animals is highly unlikely."
2481	AFP_ENG_20080426.0409.LDC2009T13	A lawmaker revealed the quarantine centre was in his suburban north-east London constituency.
2482	AFP_ENG_20080426.0409.LDC2009T13	Cases were found in nearby France and Belgium late last year.
2483	AFP_ENG_20080426.0409.LDC2009T13	Rabies can be transmitted to humans through animal bites and is nearly always fatal for those who have not been vaccinated and contract symptoms.
2484	AFP_ENG_20080426.0409.LDC2009T13	The rabies virus infects the central nervous system.
2485	AFP_ENG_20080426.0409.LDC2009T13	Symptoms include fever and headache and can progress to partial paralysis, hallucinations and fear of water.
2486	AFP_ENG_20080426.0409.LDC2009T13	Death usually occurs within days of the symptoms appearing.
2487	AFP_ENG_20080426.0409.LDC2009T13	The World Health Organisation estimates that between 40,000 and 70,000 people die from rabies each year, with most in south and south-east Asia.

2489	AFP_ENG_20080501.0511.LDC2009T13	Senegalese Prime Minister Cheikh Hadjibou Soumare confirmed Wednesday India would furnish the west African nation with its full supply of rice needs for the next six years despite a suspension of exports.Senegal has been hit by protests against rising prices of staples such as rice, amid a global food crisis which has sparked fears of malnutrition and political unrest in developing countries.
2490	AFP_ENG_20080501.0511.LDC2009T13	"India had said: 'I won't make any more rice exports but that has nothing to do with what the head of state (Abdoulaye Wade) obtained from the Indian premier," said Soumare, quoted by local media.
2491	AFP_ENG_20080501.0511.LDC2009T13	Despite India restricting exports to premium long grain basmati rice on April 1, President Wade said a week ago that he received New Delhi's assurance of a supply of 600,000 tonnes annually for the next six years.
2492	AFP_ENG_20080501.0511.LDC2009T13	"I have received a message from India's prime minister (Manmohan Singh), following my request for rice supply to meet the full needs of national consumption," Wade said on national television.

2495	AFP_ENG_20080501.0511.LDC2009T13	Wade added that the six-year timeframe would allow Senegal to develop rice cultivation in a bid for self-sufficiency, adding that the country's population should show "a bit of patience" ahead of stocks arriving.
2496	AFP_ENG_20080501.0511.LDC2009T13	Certain newspapers queried Wade's announcement, while several members of the opposition also voiced skepticism.
2497	AFP_ENG_20080501.0511.LDC2009T13	There was no further detail from Dakar as to how Senegal had managed to reach such an agreement.
2498	AFP_ENG_20080501.0511.LDC2009T13	But Soumare confirmed India's promise, mentioning "bilateral accords" without giving details.
2499	AFP_ENG_20080501.0511.LDC2009T13	New Delhi hosted an Indian-African summit on April 8 and 9 and accorded preferential status to African nations in need of rice stocks.

2553	AFP_ENG_20080513.0642.LDC2009T13	But the loss was better than its projection made in March of a 70 billion yen loss thanks to better-than-expected profit at its information and power industry sectors.
2554	AFP_ENG_20080513.0642.LDC2009T13	The loss was largely due to restructuring costs.
2555	AFP_ENG_20080513.0642.LDC2009T13	Operating profit grew 89 percent to 345.5 billion yen and sales also rose 10 percent to 11.227 trillion yen.
2556	AFP_ENG_20080513.0642.LDC2009T13	Losses related to its flat television business came to 100 billion yen for the year, and it is "still difficult" to expect profit for the sector in the current year, said Toyoaki Namakura, senior vice president and chief financial officer.
2557	AFP_ENG_20080513.0642.LDC2009T13	The company will concentrate on promotion of flat TV sales at home and in China, where demand for flat TVs is surging, he said.
2558	AFP_ENG_20080513.0642.LDC2009T13	"The market is growing rapidly in the world, but we cannot do everything quickly," Nakamura told a news conference.
2559	AFP_ENG_20080513.0642.LDC2009T13	"So we will strengthen operations in Japan and China."
2560	AFP_ENG_20080513.0642.LDC2009T13	Hitachi plans to sell 900,000 plasma displays and 1.2 million LCDs (liquid crystal displays) globally for the current year, up from 850,000 and 760,000 for the previous year respectively.
2561	AFP_ENG_20080513.0642.LDC2009T13	Hitachi is the second-biggest plasma TV producer after Panasonic maker Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., while Sony Corp. and Sharp Corp. have led the charge on LCDs.
2562	AFP_ENG_20080513.0642.LDC2009T13	For the current fiscal year to March 2009, Hitachi forecast a net profit of 40 billion yen and an operating profit up 10 percent to 380 billion yen.
2563	AFP_ENG_20080513.0642.LDC2009T13	Revenue was expected to be almost flat at 11.1 trillion yen.
2564	AFP_ENG_20080513.0642.LDC2009T13	"We have set moving into the black as our prime goal," Nakamura said.
2565	AFP_ENG_20080513.0642.LDC2009T13	Monday's massive earthquake in China damaged a factory of Hitachi's Chengdu joint venture, which has 200 workers producing inverters, but the company continued some operations.
2566	AFP_ENG_20080513.0642.LDC2009T13	While damage to the factory was limited, the entire impact of the quake on Hitachi's operations in China remained unknown, Nakamura said.
2567	AFP_ENG_20080513.0642.LDC2009T13	"We still don't know about what is going to be happening," he said.
2568	AFP_ENG_20080516.0716.LDC2009T13	US urges SKorea quickly to open beef market
2569	AFP_ENG_20080516.0716.LDC2009T13	US Commerce Secretary Carlos Gutierrez urged South Korea Friday quickly to open its market to American beef, and dismissed fears of mad cow disease which have brought thousands of protesters onto the streets.
2570	AFP_ENG_20080516.0716.LDC2009T13	"There is no safer beef.
2571	AFP_ENG_20080516.0716.LDC2009T13	It is second to none in the world," he said during a visit to Seoul aimed at pushing forward with a sweeping free trade agreement (FTA) between the two countries.
2572	AFP_ENG_20080516.0716.LDC2009T13	The FTA was signed last June but must be ratified by the legislatures of both countries.
2573	AFP_ENG_20080516.0716.LDC2009T13	Opposition parties here say they will not approve it unless a separate agreement opening the Korean market to US beef is renegotiated.
2574	AFP_ENG_20080516.0716.LDC2009T13	The two sides signed the beef deal last month.
2575	AFP_ENG_20080516.0716.LDC2009T13	But the parties and street protesters say the meat carries a risk of the human form of mad cow disease.
2576	AFP_ENG_20080516.0716.LDC2009T13	Seoul's agriculture ministry this week delayed resumption of beef imports by a week to 10 days to consider protest petitions, but says there will be no renegotiation.
2577	AFP_ENG_20080516.0716.LDC2009T13	"We look forward to the full and quick implementation of this (beef) agreement," Gutierrez told a press conference, describing the delay as unfortunate.
2578	AFP_ENG_20080516.0716.LDC2009T13	"The beef which we will be selling to Korea is the same beef that we all buy in the US, that we feed our children in the US and is the same beef that Korean- Americans eat in the US," the commerce secretary said.
2579	AFP_ENG_20080516.0716.LDC2009T13	South Korea also says the beef is totally safe.
2580	AFP_ENG_20080516.0716.LDC2009T13	But President Lee Myung-Bak has said his government should have done more to counter mad cow fears, which are fuelled by Internet postings or anonymous text messaging.
2581	AFP_ENG_20080516.0716.LDC2009T13	At a meeting with Gutierrez Friday Lee asked for US help to get the message across to Koreans.
2582	AFP_ENG_20080516.0716.LDC2009T13	"I hope (the US government) can extend a lot of support to help appease the people," he told him.
2583	AFP_ENG_20080516.0716.LDC2009T13	Gutierrez said he and Lee agreed that "facts and science" should be considered during the beef debate.
2584	AFP_ENG_20080516.0716.LDC2009T13	He reaffirmed President George W. Bush's commitment to have Congress approve the FTA this year and said he expects it to be approved once it comes to a vote.
2585	AFP_ENG_20080516.0716.LDC2009T13	The FTA "would create jobs in Korea and the US, strengthen and build prosperity in Korea and the US and give consumers greater choice in Korea and the US," Gutierrez said.
2586	AFP_ENG_20080516.0716.LDC2009T13	For South Korea's economy to reach the next level of advancement, "it will take the kind of reforms and openness the KORUS FTA will bring."
2587	AFP_ENG_20080516.0716.LDC2009T13	For the US, the commerce secretary said, lowering barriers to trade was more important than ever.
2588	AFP_ENG_20080516.0716.LDC2009T13	Trade was the second largest contributor to America's GDP in 2007 and exports in the first quarter kept the economy growing.
2589	AFP_ENG_20080516.0716.LDC2009T13	"We must make it clear to those who would support economic isolationism in America -- or in any country -- that a step away from the global economy would have devastating consequences."
2590	AFP_ENG_20080516.0716.LDC2009T13	Total trade between South Korea and the US is worth an annual 80 billion dollars.
2591	AFP_ENG_20080516.0716.LDC2009T13	Some studies show this could eventually rise by up to 20 billion dollars under a free trade regime.
2592	AFP_ENG_20080520.0542.LDC2009T13	Football: Australia's Kewell shrugs off Liverpool 'flop' label
2593	AFP_ENG_20080520.0542.LDC2009T13	Australian midfielder Harry Kewell on Tuesday dismissed criticism he was an expensive flop at Liverpool but admitted lingering regret that Reds' manager Rafael Benitez never saw his best form.
2594	AFP_ENG_20080520.0542.LDC2009T13	Kewell was released by Liverpool this month after an injury- plagued five years at the English Premier League club, during which he failed to live up to the hype surrounding his arrival in 2003.
2595	AFP_ENG_20080520.0542.LDC2009T13	British newspapers calculated Kewell cost Liverpool 160,000 pounds (312,000 dollars) a game in his 138 appearances for the club, providing a meagre return of just 16 goals.
2596	AFP_ENG_20080520.0542.LDC2009T13	His injury record prompted one newspaper to comment that Kewell cost more per game than an episode of Australian soap "Neighbours" but lasted half as long.
2597	AFP_ENG_20080520.0542.LDC2009T13	Kewell brushed aside the stinging British media criticism, remarking: "When are they ever polite?"
2598	AFP_ENG_20080520.0542.LDC2009T13	"There are always scapegoats, there are always people they want to blame," he told reporters in Australia ahead of a Socceroos friendly against Ghana in Sydney Friday.
2599	AFP_ENG_20080520.0542.LDC2009T13	"It's unfortunate I was one of them because I didn't put my hand up to get injured.
2600	AFP_ENG_20080520.0542.LDC2009T13	It's a shame because I ain't done nothing wrong.
2601	AFP_ENG_20080520.0542.LDC2009T13	"It's something that they live and die for over there.
2602	AFP_ENG_20080520.0542.LDC2009T13	"They want to write things that aren't nice, but you just don't read it and you get on with your life."
2603	AFP_ENG_20080520.0542.LDC2009T13	The 29-year-old said he knew what he was capable of producing on the pitch but injuries meant he was never able to display his full abilities to Benitez.
2604	AFP_ENG_20080520.0542.LDC2009T13	"The one person I would like to show is probably my old manager," he said.
2605	AFP_ENG_20080520.0542.LDC2009T13	"I didn't get a chance to show him a lot of what I could do.
2606	AFP_ENG_20080520.0542.LDC2009T13	It would be great just to show him what I was capable of doing."
2607	AFP_ENG_20080520.0542.LDC2009T13	Earlier this month Benitez said Liverpool had tried to reach an agreement with Kewell -- who was on a reported 50,000 pounds a week -- but it had not been possible.
2608	AFP_ENG_20080520.0542.LDC2009T13	Kewell played down reports suggesting he was moving to FA Cup winners Portsmouth, saying he was keeping his options open
2609	AFP_ENG_20080520.0542.LDC2009T13	"I have never shied away from going abroad, playing in the Premiership or playing anywhere," he said.

2611	AFP_ENG_20080524.0108.LDC2009T13	Munster won their second European Cup title in three seasons with a nail-biting 16-13 triumph over Toulouse in the final at the Millennium Stadium here on Saturday.
2612	AFP_ENG_20080524.0108.LDC2009T13	Denis Leamy's first half try was supported by 11 points from the ice-cool Ronan O'Gara as head coach Declan Kidney was handed the perfect send-off.
2613	AFP_ENG_20080524.0108.LDC2009T13	Kidney masterminded another European crown but he now leaves Munster to take on the Ireland national team job.
2614	AFP_ENG_20080524.0108.LDC2009T13	Winger Yves Donguy gave Toulouse a lifeline with his second half score but O'Gara clinched victory with his third penalty with 15 minutes remaining.
2615	AFP_ENG_20080524.0108.LDC2009T13	Toulouse went in search of their fourth European Cup title while Munster returned to the scene of their 2006 triumph.
2616	AFP_ENG_20080524.0108.LDC2009T13	The Irish province are the only side to have reached the knock- out stages in the past decade and they showed everyone just why with a rugged display towards victory.
2617	AFP_ENG_20080524.0108.LDC2009T13	The final pumped 20 million pounds into Cardiff and a large proportion of that income came from the Irishmen who invaded the Welsh capital to say a fond farewell to Kidney.
2618	AFP_ENG_20080524.0108.LDC2009T13	Munster had tasted both joy and despair at the Millennium Stadium on their previous two visits.
2619	AFP_ENG_20080524.0108.LDC2009T13	Kidney's men snatched victory for their first European Cup title against Biarritz but also suffered heartbreak to Leicester in 2002.
2620	AFP_ENG_20080524.0108.LDC2009T13	And Kidney's last stand came against legendary Toulouse coach Guy Noves who was present when the French outfit won their first title in Cardiff back in 1996.
2621	AFP_ENG_20080524.0108.LDC2009T13	But this time he was without joint leading try scorer Vincent Clerc through injury.
2622	AFP_ENG_20080524.0108.LDC2009T13	Captains Febian Pelous and Paul O'Connell led their sides into a cauldron of noise at the Millennium Stadium.
2623	AFP_ENG_20080524.0108.LDC2009T13	Toulouse had the first opportunity to open the scoring but Jean- Baptiste Elissalde pulled his fourth minute penalty attempt wide.
2624	AFP_ENG_20080524.0108.LDC2009T13	However, Elissalde cooly slotted home two minutes later to hand Toulouse the lead.
2625	AFP_ENG_20080524.0108.LDC2009T13	French centre Yannick Jauzion beat Munster full-back Denis Hurley to the high ball and Elissalde made no mistake from close-range.
2626	AFP_ENG_20080524.0108.LDC2009T13	It was one-way traffic from Toulouse who continued to pile on the pressure in the opening quarter but Munster remained just three points adrift thanks to their committed defence.
2627	AFP_ENG_20080524.0108.LDC2009T13	And in the Irishmen's first attack on the half hour mark, Hurley was stopped just shy of the try-line following Doug Howlett‘s mazy run.
2628	AFP_ENG_20080524.0108.LDC2009T13	Munster were gathering momentum and number eight Leamy was denied by video referee Derek Bevan after he dropped the ball with the line at his mercy.
2629	AFP_ENG_20080524.0108.LDC2009T13	But after a series of close-range drives, Leamy powered over for the first try of a compelling encounter.
2630	AFP_ENG_20080524.0108.LDC2009T13	O'Gara extended the lead with the conversion and then a penalty to nudge Munster seven points clear.
2631	AFP_ENG_20080524.0108.LDC2009T13	Kidney's men were handed a boost when Pelous was yellow-carded for kneeing Alan Quinlan in the back in the 50th minute.
2632	AFP_ENG_20080524.0108.LDC2009T13	O'Gara kicked another penalty but Toulouse hit back when a moment of genius from Cedric Heymans brought the three-times champions back in the contest.
2633	AFP_ENG_20080524.0108.LDC2009T13	Yves Donguy added the finishing touch after Heymans' delightful chip and chase released Jauzion who beat O'Gara to the chase.
2634	AFP_ENG_20080524.0108.LDC2009T13	Elissalde converted to tie the scores before O‘Gara booted his third decisive penalty to put Munster back in front with 15 minutes remaining.

2636	AFP_ENG_20080525.0233.LDC2009T13	A strong aftershock jolted southwestern China on Sunday, killing at least one person, destroying 70,000 homes and rattling millions still reeling from the massive earthquake two weeks ago.
2637	AFP_ENG_20080525.0233.LDC2009T13	The aftershock -- the strongest to hit Sichuan province since the devastating May 12 quake -- came as the death toll from the initial tremor topped 62,500, and as more foreign aid poured into the disaster zone.
2638	AFP_ENG_20080525.0233.LDC2009T13	Relief workers raced to reach those in need as the already tough conditions for millions of survivors living in makeshift camps worsened, with rain falling throughout the day and forecasters predicting heavy downpours overnight.
2639	AFP_ENG_20080525.0233.LDC2009T13	Sunday's aftershock measured 6.4 on the Richter scale, an official with the Sichuan Earthquake Bureau told AFP -- making it the strongest since the 8.0 quake that destroyed large swathes of Sichuan two weeks ago.
2640	AFP_ENG_20080525.0233.LDC2009T13	The US Geological Survey put the magnitude of Sunday's aftershock at 5.8.
2641	AFP_ENG_20080525.0233.LDC2009T13	One person was killed and more than 400 injured, 28 of them seriously, in the aftershock, with the city of Guangyuan, north of the provincial capital Chengdu, particularly hard hit, state- run Xinhua news agency reported.
2642	AFP_ENG_20080525.0233.LDC2009T13	An earthquake relief official in the city of Guangyuan, Wang Fei, was quoted by Xinhua as saying about 71,300 homes had collapsed there, and more than 200,000 others were in danger of collapsing.
2643	AFP_ENG_20080525.0233.LDC2009T13	The quake -- which struck mid-afternoon and was centred about 250 kilometres (155 miles) northeast of Chengdu -- sent people fleeing from buildings, AFP correspondents witnessed.
2644	AFP_ENG_20080525.0233.LDC2009T13	"Houses started to shake and everybody went out into the street," Chengdu resident Lou Taiyi told AFP.
2645	AFP_ENG_20080525.0233.LDC2009T13	"We were thinking (May 12) was behind us but it is continuing," he said.
2646	AFP_ENG_20080525.0233.LDC2009T13	The aftershock compounded fears of further destruction stemming from the May 12 disaster -- the worst earthquake in China in more than 30 years.
2647	AFP_ENG_20080525.0233.LDC2009T13	The government said the quake had left 69 dams in danger of bursting and created "dangerous situations" at hundreds of others.
2648	AFP_ENG_20080525.0233.LDC2009T13	E Jingping, vice minister of water resources, however told reporters in Beijing that authorities had taken a number of steps to alleviate the danger, including draining or lowering the water levels at hundreds of reservoirs.
2649	AFP_ENG_20080525.0233.LDC2009T13	The death toll continued to rise, with the government putting the figure Sunday at 62,664, with another 23,775 listed as missing.
2650	AFP_ENG_20080525.0233.LDC2009T13	Aid continued to pour into the region for the more than 5.4 million homeless survivors and more than 11 million people who China says are expected to be evacuated from quake-hit areas to temporary camps.
2651	AFP_ENG_20080525.0233.LDC2009T13	A Russian military transport plane carrying tents, blankets, field hospitals and other supplies landed in Chengdu, state media reports said -- one of 12 Russian aid flights expected.
2652	AFP_ENG_20080525.0233.LDC2009T13	A French medical team also arrived in Chengdu and headed for Guangyuan to help treat quake victims there, members told AFP.
2653	AFP_ENG_20080525.0233.LDC2009T13	China has praised such foreign help, with Premier Wen Jiabao thanking the international community for its help during a visit on Saturday to the devastated town of Yingxiu with UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon.
2654	AFP_ENG_20080525.0233.LDC2009T13	On the home front, President Hu Jintao urged workers at a factory making pre- fabricated housing in central Hubei province to "go all out and complete the order early, so as to support the earthquake relief work," Xinhua said.
2655	AFP_ENG_20080525.0233.LDC2009T13	Although state media reported that an 80-year-old man was pulled from the rubble on Friday, rescue teams have admitted the search for survivors was over, with the focus now on clean-up and reconstruction operations.
2656	AFP_ENG_20080525.0233.LDC2009T13	"I think we have a lot of work to do today, but it will be only finding dead bodies.
2657	AFP_ENG_20080525.0233.LDC2009T13	I don't think there are any more survivors," Saad Attia, a member of a Dutch team combing through the rubble in the town of Hanwang, told AFP.
2658	AFP_ENG_20080525.0233.LDC2009T13	Grief turned to anger for about two dozen parents of children killed in the quake, who staged a rare protest Sunday demanding a probe into whether shoddy school construction was to blame for the deaths of their children.
2659	AFP_ENG_20080525.0233.LDC2009T13	"We are complaining about the shoddy quality of school buildings and we need justice from the government," 38-year-old Yang Fuyong, whose daughter died in the disaster, told AFP.
2660	AFP_ENG_20080525.0233.LDC2009T13	State media has said 9,000 teachers or schoolchildren were among the dead and missing.
2661	AFP_ENG_20080525.0233.LDC2009T13	The government has vowed to investigate and punish anyone found responsible for substandard construction at schools.

2668	AFP_ENG_20080525.0473.LDC2009T13	Speaking after Japan sealed the trophy by outclassing Hong Kong 75-29 last week, he said his side still had work to do.

2674	AFP_ENG_20080525.0473.LDC2009T13	The tournament pits 16th-ranked Japan against Fiji, Samoa, the New Zealand Maoris, Tonga and Australia A.
2675	AFP_ENG_20080525.0473.LDC2009T13	Although all the headlines in this year's Five Nations tournament have been made by the rampant Japanese, South Korea were delighted to confirm their position as number two in Asia's pecking order.
2676	AFP_ENG_20080525.0473.LDC2009T13	Captain Kim Kwang-Mo said a Test defeat to Hong Kong last year had given his side added motivation and the team looked fired up as they raced into an early 24-0 lead.
2677	AFP_ENG_20080525.0473.LDC2009T13	"The main motivation was last year.
2678	AFP_ENG_20080525.0473.LDC2009T13	We were shocked last year and that kept us motivated," he said, adding that he was delighted by the margin of the victory.
2679	AFP_ENG_20080525.0473.LDC2009T13	Kim refused to be intimidated by the manner of Japan's win this year, setting his sights on a tournament win in 2009.
2680	AFP_ENG_20080525.0473.LDC2009T13	"The Japanese players' level is very high but if the players focus and train hard for next year I'm sure we can beat them," he said.
2681	AFP_ENG_20080525.0473.LDC2009T13	Hong Kong coach John Walters was disappointed his team failed to secure second spot but vowed to come back stronger.
2682	AFP_ENG_20080525.0473.LDC2009T13	Saying the Five Nations was "great for Hong Kong and Asia," he said the side had shown a lot of character and had a solid base on which to build.
2683	AFP_ENG_20080525.0473.LDC2009T13	"We have got a lot of things in place this year and it will probably take a couple of years to see the full benefit," he said.
2684	AFP_ENG_20080525.0473.LDC2009T13	This tournament is the pinnacle of four newly formed tiers of competition across 25 Asian rugby unions, with the last-placed team in the top tier, the Arabian Gulf, relegated to the 2009 division one competition.
2685	AFP_ENG_20080525.0473.LDC2009T13	The standard of rugby in Asia lags far behind countries such as Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and England, but the International Rugby Board sees plenty of potential here, and the Five Nations was launched as a platform to develop and expand the sport across the region.

2687	AFP_ENG_20080527.0412.LDC2009T13	Aid workers and peacekeepers are sexually abusing young children in war zones and disaster zones but their actions are largely going unpunished, a British charity said Tuesday.
2688	AFP_ENG_20080527.0412.LDC2009T13	"Children as young as six are trading sex with aid workers and peacekeepers in exchange for food, money, soap and, in very few cases, luxury items such as mobile phones," Save the Children said in a report.
2689	AFP_ENG_20080527.0412.LDC2009T13	It also highlighted instances of rape, verbal sexual abuse, child pornography and prostitution and trafficking of youngsters, many of whom are poor, displaced or orphaned by conflict.
2690	AFP_ENG_20080527.0412.LDC2009T13	The group said the scale of abuse was "significant".
2691	AFP_ENG_20080527.0412.LDC2009T13	Its findings were based on work with hundreds of youngsters from Ivory Coast, southern Sudan and Haiti, said the charity's chief executive Jasmine Whitbread.
2692	AFP_ENG_20080527.0412.LDC2009T13	"This research exposes the despicable actions of a small number of perpetrators who are sexually abusing some of the most vulnerable children in the world, the very children they are meant to protect," she added.
2693	AFP_ENG_20080527.0412.LDC2009T13	"It is hard to imagine a more grotesque abuse of authority or flagrant violation of children's rights."
2694	AFP_ENG_20080527.0412.LDC2009T13	The charity said "endemic failures" in responding to the abuse that was officially reported were letting down the abused, and better reporting mechanisms should be introduced.
2695	AFP_ENG_20080527.0412.LDC2009T13	Fear of aid and assistance being withdrawn, being stigmatised by the local community, fear of reprisals, lack of faith in the response or simply ignorance about how to report abuse were also major factors, it added.
2696	AFP_ENG_20080527.0412.LDC2009T13	Whitbread said the United Nations, the wider world as well as humanitarian and aid agencies have made important commitments to tackle the problem in recent years.
2697	AFP_ENG_20080527.0412.LDC2009T13	But most had failed to turn their promises into action, she added, calling for all agencies working in emergencies, including her own, to "own up to the fact that they are vulnerable to this problem and tackle it head on".
2698	AFP_ENG_20080527.0412.LDC2009T13	The UN Department for Peacekeeping Operations was said to be the group most likely to be responsible for abuse.
2699	AFP_ENG_20080527.0412.LDC2009T13	Save the Children said there had been 15 claims against its staff and partners last year, of which three were upheld.
2700	AFP_ENG_20080527.0412.LDC2009T13	UNPKO spokesman Nick Birnback said it was "entirely unacceptable" that those sent to help the most vulnerable are instead causing grievous harm.
2701	AFP_ENG_20080527.0412.LDC2009T13	"Clearly a lot more has to be done," he told BBC radio but he rejected allegations that the problem was widespread and those responsible were getting away with it.
2702	AFP_ENG_20080527.0412.LDC2009T13	"The vast majority of UN peacekeepers all over the world, of which we have over 100,000 now, serve with honour and courage in very difficult situations and don't engage in this unacceptable behaviour," he added.
2703	AFP_ENG_20080527.0412.LDC2009T13	The reputation of UN peacekeepers has been tarnished in the past by cases of sexual abuse against women, notably in Democratic Republic of Congo, Ivory Coast and Haiti.
2704	AFP_ENG_20080527.0412.LDC2009T13	In November last year, the UN said that more than 100 Sri Lankan soldiers were to be sent home over charges that they paid for sex while stationed in Haiti.
2705	AFP_ENG_20080527.0412.LDC2009T13	After turning a blind eye for decades to cases of abuse by its peacekeepers -- the world body recommended in 2005 that erring soldiers be punished, their salaries frozen and a fund set up to help any women or girls made pregnant.
2706	AFP_ENG_20080527.0412.LDC2009T13	The "zero tolerance" policy towards sexual misconduct includes a "non- fraternisation" rule barring them from sex with locals.
2707	AFP_ENG_20080527.0412.LDC2009T13	It was brought in after revelations in December 2004 that peacekeepers in DRC were involved in the sexual abuse of 13-year- old girls in exchange for eggs, milk or cash sums as low as one dollar.

2709	AFP_ENG_20080529.5003.LDC2009T13	Vienna, which chose to revamp a 77-year-old stadium rather than build a new one for the Euro, will host the June 29 final in a venue that was once the site of Nazi propaganda and racial experiments.
2710	AFP_ENG_20080529.5003.LDC2009T13	The Ernst Happel stadium, originally named Prater stadium after the area of Vienna in which it is located, opened in 1931 for the second Workers' Olympiad after 23 months of construction.
2711	AFP_ENG_20080529.5003.LDC2009T13	A "utopia made of steel, glass and concrete," the sleek structure by German architect Otto Ernst Schweizer was then considered the most modern stadium in Europe.
2712	AFP_ENG_20080529.5003.LDC2009T13	The venue, which was home to the celebrated Austrian Wunderteam of the 1930s, originally held 60,000 at a time when men still wore hats to games.
2713	AFP_ENG_20080529.5003.LDC2009T13	It was later increased to 90,000 in the 1950s, before standing places were abolished.
2714	AFP_ENG_20080529.5003.LDC2009T13	Renovated in 1986, the stadium was renamed after legendary Austrian coach Ernst Happel in 1993 and is now a protected landmark.
2715	AFP_ENG_20080529.5003.LDC2009T13	But the affectionately nicknamed "Old Lady," which underwent further restoration in preparation for the Euro at a cost of 36.9 million euros (58.2 million dollars), also served a more sinister purpose during the 1930s.
2716	AFP_ENG_20080529.5003.LDC2009T13	On May 1, 1934, marching schoolchildren paid tribute to Austro- fascist Chancellor Engelbert Dolfuss at the stadium, in a pompous Labour Day spectacle during which he proclaimed a new constitution, effectively turning Austria into an authoritarian state.
2717	AFP_ENG_20080529.5003.LDC2009T13	Four years later, on April 3, 1938, the stadium hosted the so- called Anschluss Spiel, or "annexation match," following Austria's occupation by Adolf Hitler's Germany on March 12.
2718	AFP_ENG_20080529.5003.LDC2009T13	Staged by Nazi propagandists as a reconciliation between two parts of the Reich that belonged together, the game - one week before an April 10 referendum, in which Austrians would overwhelmingly vote to join the Third Reich - nevertheless saw Austria defeat Germany 2-0, before an array of Nazi high officials.
2719	AFP_ENG_20080529.5003.LDC2009T13	A year later on September 10-11, 1939, the stadium took on a new role as the German Gestapo locked up over 1,000 Jewish men there on the ground that the prisons were full.
2720	AFP_ENG_20080529.5003.LDC2009T13	Josef Wastl, the then-director of the anthropology department at Vienna's Natural History Museum, examined some 440 detainees, taking measurements of their bodies and features for an "Anthropology of Jews" report, with photos, hair samples and plaster masks of their faces.
2721	AFP_ENG_20080529.5003.LDC2009T13	The prisoners were sent to Buchenwald concentration camp on September 30 and business resumed as usual on the following day, as the stadium once again played host to a football game.
2722	AFP_ENG_20080530.0401.LDC2009T13	Dollar climbs against euro, yen
2723	AFP_ENG_20080530.0401.LDC2009T13	The dollar resumed its climb against the euro and yen on Friday following losses in Asian trade and after a rally overnight sparked by an upgrade to US economic growth, traders said.
2724	AFP_ENG_20080530.0401.LDC2009T13	In European trading, the euro fell to 1.5487 dollars from 1.5503 in New York late on Thursday.
2725	AFP_ENG_20080530.0401.LDC2009T13	Against the Japanese currency, the dollar rose to 105.54 yen from 105.52.
2726	AFP_ENG_20080530.0401.LDC2009T13	The greenback had got a boost on Thursday after first-quarter US growth was revised to a 0.9 percent annual pace from the initial estimate of 0.6 percent.
2727	AFP_ENG_20080530.0401.LDC2009T13	The dollar briefly rose to 105.88 yen in New York, a level not seen since late February, but it failed to sustain the advance in Asian trade on Friday.
2728	AFP_ENG_20080530.0401.LDC2009T13	Dealers said the US growth data further reduced prospects of another interest rate cut by the US Federal Reserve and this supported the dollar, which has suffered against the euro because of a large yield differential.
2729	AFP_ENG_20080530.0401.LDC2009T13	"Certainly the signs are that the Fed's burst of easing is probably over and that is causing the market to reappraise the possibility of interest rate hikes," said Ian Copsey, a senior financial analyst at Global Forex Trading.
2730	AFP_ENG_20080530.0401.LDC2009T13	The dollar has also been supported this week by a rebound on Wall Street.
2731	AFP_ENG_20080530.0401.LDC2009T13	But Shuichi Kanehira, a forex dealer at Mizuho Corporate Bank, believes stocks may struggle to sustain the upward momentum.
2732	AFP_ENG_20080530.0401.LDC2009T13	"While the stock market has not so far showed any negative response to rising Treasury yields, which lent support to the dollar, the stock market may start reacting negatively to a change in the market's perception about interest rates," Kanehira said.
2733	AFP_ENG_20080530.0401.LDC2009T13	"In addition, we have to assess once again the current state of the US economy through such important data as non-farm payroll data" due next week, he added.
2734	AFP_ENG_20080530.0401.LDC2009T13	The US Federal Reserve has been steadily easing its monetary policy, lowering its benchmark Fed Funds rate to 2.0 percent amid slower economic growth.
2735	AFP_ENG_20080530.0401.LDC2009T13	In London on Friday, the euro changed hands at 1.5487 dollars against 1.5503 late on Thursday, at 163.39 yen (163.58), 0.7860 pounds (0.7849) and 1.6277 Swiss francs (1.6275).
2736	AFP_ENG_20080530.0401.LDC2009T13	The dollar stood at 105.54 yen (105.52) and 1.0508 Swiss francs (1.0496).

2740	AFP_ENG_20080701.0128.LDC2009T13	Mongolian President Nambariin Enkhbayar late Tuesday declared a four-day state of emergency amid violent protests in the capital over alleged rigged elections, according to national television.
2741	AFP_ENG_20080701.0128.LDC2009T13	"From 11:30 pm (1530 GMT) on Tuesday there will be a four-day state of emergency," the announcement said.
2742	AFP_ENG_20080701.0128.LDC2009T13	It added that there would be a 10:00 pm curfew and anyone on the streets after that time without documentation would be arrested.
2743	AFP_ENG_20080701.0128.LDC2009T13	Public gatherings are banned and any such meetings will be broken up, according to the TV announcement, which also includes a ban on media except for Mongolian national TV and state media organisations.
2744	AFP_ENG_20080701.0128.LDC2009T13	The action was taken in response to the protests involving thousands of people in Mongolia's capital on Tuesday, voicing outrage over what they claimed were rigged elections.
2745	AFP_ENG_20080701.0128.LDC2009T13	Witnesses said police were forced to fire rubber bullets to quell the violence.
2746	AFP_ENG_20080701.0128.LDC2009T13	The headquarters of the former communist Mongolian Peoples Revolutionary Party (MPRP) in the centre of Ulan Bator was set alight and looted, according to an AFP reporter and other witnesses at the scene.
2747	AFP_ENG_20080701.0128.LDC2009T13	Some within roughly 6,000 protesters from the rival Democratic Party, which claims the MPRP bought votes and used other tactics to win Sunday's election, threw rocks at firefighters who arrived to put out the blaze.
2748	AFP_ENG_20080701.0128.LDC2009T13	Police responded by firing rubber bullets and tear gas but the clashes continued and showed few signs of abating as night fell.
2749	AFP_ENG_20080701.0128.LDC2009T13	Later, violence spread to other parts of the capital.
2750	AFP_ENG_20080701.0128.LDC2009T13	A police station was attacked when protesters attempted to free rioters imprisoned earlier in the day.
2751	AFP_ENG_20080701.0128.LDC2009T13	Part of the Cultural Palace, which contains an art gallery, a museum and a theatre, was on fire early Wednesday as violence continued.
2752	AFP_ENG_20080701.0128.LDC2009T13	Up to 30 policemen and 25 civilians were injured and hospitalised in the rioting, according to television reports, citing officials and hospitals.
2753	AFP_ENG_20080701.0128.LDC2009T13	A European photographer said he was been beaten by police when he attempted to take photographs of police violence.

2755	AFP_ENG_20080701.0128.LDC2009T13	The technically neutral President Enkhbayar -- previously with the MPRP -- earlier called an emergency security meeting that involved Prime Minister Sanjagiin Bayar and all opposition party leaders.
2756	AFP_ENG_20080701.0128.LDC2009T13	At the meeting, broadcast live on the privately run Eagle television, the MPRP- affiliated Bayar renewed his calls for restraint while blaming the Democrats for inciting the rioters after losing the elections.
2757	AFP_ENG_20080701.0128.LDC2009T13	Democrat leader Tsakhia Elbegdorj countered that MPRP corruption had prompted the riots and torching of the MPRP building.
2758	AFP_ENG_20080701.0128.LDC2009T13	Before the unrest erupted, Elbegdorj said bluntly that "illegal activities" had robbed the Democrats of victory.
2759	AFP_ENG_20080701.0128.LDC2009T13	"This was a dark moment in the history of Mongolia," he added.

2795	AFP_ENG_20080705.0237.LDC2009T13	Gyari said the stance of the Chinese government had cast doubt on the benefit of continuing the talks.
2796	AFP_ENG_20080705.0237.LDC2009T13	"We were compelled to candidly convey to our counterparts that in the absence of serious and sincere commitment on their part the continuation of the present dialogue process would serve no purpose," he said.
2797	AFP_ENG_20080705.0237.LDC2009T13	But the envoys have agreed to at least one more round of talks in October, after Beijing hosts the Olympics in August, to gauge China's level of commitment in resolving concerns over Tibet, he said.
2798	AFP_ENG_20080705.0237.LDC2009T13	China's opponents accuse it of systematic political, cultural and religious oppression in the remote and devoutly Buddhist Himalayan region.
2799	AFP_ENG_20080705.0237.LDC2009T13	Beijing has accused the Dalai Lama of fomenting unrest in the Tibetan region that erupted on March 14 after four days of peaceful protests against Chinese rule.
2800	AFP_ENG_20080705.0237.LDC2009T13	China has ruled Tibet since 1951, a year after sending troops in to "liberate" the region.
2801	AFP_ENG_20080707.0320.LDC2009T13	Berlin mulling measures to attract skilled foreign workers
2802	AFP_ENG_20080707.0320.LDC2009T13	Germany plans soon to adopt measures aimed at relieving a shortage of qualified workers in certain sectors by attracting foreign candidates, an official spokesman said Monday.Although the ministry spokesman did not provide details, the confirmation came after a newspaper said Saturday that authorities were mulling an "index of worker needs."
2803	AFP_ENG_20080707.0320.LDC2009T13	The report said officials could poll 7,000 companies each month to determine what kinds of skills were needed in the coming six months and adapt the granting of work vias accordingly.
2804	AFP_ENG_20080707.0320.LDC2009T13	A spokesman for the Labour Ministry "neither denied, nor confirmed" the report but acknowledged that the search for a "control system to identify needs" was "the reflective framework within which we are proceeding."
2805	AFP_ENG_20080707.0320.LDC2009T13	Government spokesman Thomas Steg said the subject had been discussed intensively, in particular between the social democrat labour minister and his conservative counterpart at the interior ministry.
2806	AFP_ENG_20080707.0320.LDC2009T13	A proposition was expected to be presented to the full cabinet on either July 16 or 23, Steg added.
2807	AFP_ENG_20080707.0320.LDC2009T13	Certain sectors of the biggest European economy, notably high- tech firms, are handicapped by a serious shortage of engineers, programmers and qualified technicians.
2808	AFP_ENG_20080707.0320.LDC2009T13	The national engineering federation said last month that around 100,000 engineering posts were vacant throughout Germany.
2809	AFP_ENG_20080707.0320.LDC2009T13	Measures taken by the government to date have been judged too restrictive by the business sector and have not noticeably improved the situation.
2810	AFP_ENG_20080707.0320.LDC2009T13	All the same, the government was expected to extend the period before which non- skilled workers from Eastern Europe could come freely to Germany, a measure that German businesses would like to see abandoned.
2811	AFP_ENG_20080707.0320.LDC2009T13	When the European Union extended eastwards in 2004, Germany obtained permission to maintain its ban on foreign workers until 2009, and possibly two years longer.
2812	AFP_ENG_20080707.0320.LDC2009T13	Labour Minister Olaf Scholz has "a certain sympathy for an extension," owing to substantial unemployment levels, his spokesman said Monday, but "with an exception for skilled workers."

2814	AFP_ENG_20080707.0579.LDC2009T13	China's iconic "Bird's Nest" National Stadium will replace communist hero Mao Zedong on a special currency note to be issued on Tuesday for the Beijing Olympics, the country's central bank said.The People's Bank of China said in a weekend statement on its website that it would issue six million Olympic 10-yuan (1.5-dollar) notes.
2815	AFP_ENG_20080707.0579.LDC2009T13	On one side of the note is an image of the National Stadium, known as the "Bird's Nest" because of its interlocking mesh of steel, according to images of the currency posted on the website.
2816	AFP_ENG_20080707.0579.LDC2009T13	Above the stadium -- the main venue for next month's Games -- is the dancing-man emblem for the 2008 Olympics.
2817	AFP_ENG_20080707.0579.LDC2009T13	Both the picture of the Bird's Nest and the emblem are set against the backdrop of the Temple of Heaven, one of the country's best-known landmarks.
2818	AFP_ENG_20080707.0579.LDC2009T13	The images will replace a portrait of Mao, who founded communist China in 1949 and whose face adorns all modern Chinese bank notes.
2819	AFP_ENG_20080707.0579.LDC2009T13	But older, smaller denomination notes are still in circulation without his image.
2820	AFP_ENG_20080707.0579.LDC2009T13	The last time Mao's image was removed from a Chinese currency was for the 2000 millennium celebrations.
2821	AFP_ENG_20080707.0579.LDC2009T13	At that time, the central bank replaced Mao's portrait on a 100-yuan note with a dragon.
2822	AFP_ENG_20080707.0579.LDC2009T13	The other side of the Olympic note features the famous ancient Greek marble statue of a discus-thrower, Discobolus, portraits of athletes and the numerals "2008."
2823	AFP_ENG_20080707.0579.LDC2009T13	On normal notes an image of the famous Three Gorges waterway in southern China features on that side.
2824	AFP_ENG_20080707.0579.LDC2009T13	The waterway has recently been controversially dammed.
2825	AFP_ENG_20080707.0579.LDC2009T13	Watermarks and other technologies are to be used in printing to prevent counterfeiting of the notes, the bank said.
2826	AFP_ENG_20080707.0579.LDC2009T13	The notes, predominantly a greenish-blue with a splash of red, are slightly larger than the ordinary 10-yuan notes, which are a more sombre grey and black.

3216	AFP_ENG_20080724.0211.LDC2009T13	Police on Thursday found a second weapons cache in northern Spain linked to nine suspected members of the Basque separatist group ETA arrested this week, Spanish media reported.
3217	AFP_ENG_20080724.0211.LDC2009T13	A judicial source told AFP that Spain's top anti-terror judge Baltazar Garzon was in the town of Santo Domingo de la Calzada in the northern province of La Rioja where Spanish media reported the weapons cache was found.
3218	AFP_ENG_20080724.0211.LDC2009T13	Public radio RNE said the weapons cache was being inspected by Garzon and it could contain about 100 kilograms (220 pounds) of explosives.

3224	AFP_ENG_20080728.0023.LDC2009T13	Negotiators hit a "very tense" and uncertain stage in talks to forge a global trade pact as key powers prepared to tackle a crucial outstanding issue in a late meeting, a WTO spokesman said Tuesday.
3225	AFP_ENG_20080728.0023.LDC2009T13	"The situation is very tense, things are finely balanced and the outcome is by no means certain," the spokesman, Keith Rockwell, told reporters, adding that delegates were focussing on the sticking point of import tariff changes.
3226	AFP_ENG_20080728.0023.LDC2009T13	"The issue for the past 12 hours has very largely been the SSM," he said, naming the "special safeguard mechanism" to protect poor farmers from surges in imports, which has split India and the United States at this week's talks.
3227	AFP_ENG_20080728.0023.LDC2009T13	Talks have dragged on for more than a week as ministers tried to bridge their differences on subsidies and import tariffs to forge a new trade deal under the World Trade Organization's Doha Round.

3233	AFP_ENG_20080728.0133.LDC2009T13	A man-made wildfire raged near California's Yosemite National Park on Monday, threatening thousands of homes in the latest large-scale blaze to ravage the state, officials said.
3234	AFP_ENG_20080728.0133.LDC2009T13	The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CALFIRE) said 2,000 homes were at risk from the fire, which has already gutted 12 homes, scorched 26,130 acres (10,574 hectares), and injured three people.
3235	AFP_ENG_20080728.0133.LDC2009T13	The blaze -- which was triggered by people target shooting on Friday -- is burning in the rugged forest and scrubland of the Sierra Nevada foothills in Mariposa county, around 25 miles (40 kilometers) west of Yosemite.
3236	AFP_ENG_20080728.0133.LDC2009T13	Around 2,500 firefighters have been deployed to tackle the fire, which comes after a month-long firestorm across California that scorched more than one million acres (400,000 hectares) since June 20.
3237	AFP_ENG_20080728.0133.LDC2009T13	California is frequently hit by scorching wildfires due to its dry climate, Santa Ana winds and recent housing booms which have seen housing spread rapidly into rural and densely forested areas.
3238	AFP_ENG_20080728.0133.LDC2009T13	In October, devastating wildfires were among the worst in California history, leaving eight people dead, destroying 2,000 homes, displacing 640,000 people and causing one billion dollars in damage.
3239	AFP_ENG_20080730.0574.LDC2009T13	Olympics: China to censor Internet during Games -- organisers
3240	AFP_ENG_20080730.0574.LDC2009T13	Foreign reporters will not have complete access to the Internet during the Beijing Olympics, Games organisers said Wednesday, reversing a pledge to bring down the Chinese firewall of censorship.
3241	AFP_ENG_20080730.0574.LDC2009T13	Sites linked to the banned Falungong spiritual movement and other unspecified ones would remain blocked for the thousands of foreign reporters covering the Games, organising committee spokesman Sun Weide told AFP.
3242	AFP_ENG_20080730.0574.LDC2009T13	"During the Olympic Games we will provide sufficient access to the Internet for reporters," said Sun.
3243	AFP_ENG_20080730.0574.LDC2009T13	However "sufficient" access falls short of the complete Internet freedoms for foreign reporters that China's communist authorities had promised in the run-up to the Games, which begin on August 8.
3244	AFP_ENG_20080730.0574.LDC2009T13	The head of the International Olympic Committee's press commission, Kevan Gosper, told AFP that he would take the matter up with Chinese officials.
3245	AFP_ENG_20080730.0574.LDC2009T13	"I will speak with the Chinese authorities to advise them of the restraints and to see what their reaction is," he said.
3246	AFP_ENG_20080730.0574.LDC2009T13	Australian Olympic team chief John Coates, who is also an IOC member, expressed frustration with the decision to continue to censor the Internet, pointing out that China had gone back on one of its "key" Olympic promises.
3247	AFP_ENG_20080730.0574.LDC2009T13	"It certainly is disappointing... I think it's a matter that the IOC will take seriously," Coates told reporters at the main press centre for the Games here where sensitive Internet sites remained blocked.
3248	AFP_ENG_20080730.0574.LDC2009T13	In an exclusive interview with AFP two weeks ago, Rogge insisted that there would be no censorship of the Internet.
3249	AFP_ENG_20080730.0574.LDC2009T13	"For the first time, foreign media will be able to report freely and publish their work freely in China," he said.
3250	AFP_ENG_20080730.0574.LDC2009T13	"There will be no censorship on the Internet."
3251	AFP_ENG_20080730.0574.LDC2009T13	However Sun said China's pledge was only to allow foreign reporters enough information to carry out their duties to cover the Games, not to have unfettered Internet access.
3252	AFP_ENG_20080730.0574.LDC2009T13	"Our promise was that journalists would be able to use the Internet for their work during the Olympic Games," he said.
3253	AFP_ENG_20080730.0574.LDC2009T13	"So we have given them sufficient access to do that."
3254	AFP_ENG_20080730.0574.LDC2009T13	Falungong is a particularly sensitive issue for China's communist authorities, who outlawed the group in 1999, describing it as an evil cult.
3255	AFP_ENG_20080730.0574.LDC2009T13	Sun would not say which other sites would remain censored for foreign reporters.
3256	AFP_ENG_20080730.0574.LDC2009T13	But journalists working at the main press centre for the Olympics could not access a wide range of sites on Wednesday.
3257	AFP_ENG_20080730.0574.LDC2009T13	When AFP accessed the Internet through the wireless system at the centre, a wide range of sites considered sensitive by the Chinese government were blocked.
3258	AFP_ENG_20080730.0574.LDC2009T13	These included sites for Amnesty International, the Tibet government-in-exile, dissidents, and ones giving information about the 1989 Tiananmen massacre in which the Chinese military crushed democracy protests.
3259	AFP_ENG_20080730.0574.LDC2009T13	Chinese authorities operate strict Internet censorship with a so- called "Great Firewall of China" that blocks information the Communist Party views as improper, unhealthy or a threat to its rule.
3260	AFP_ENG_20080730.0574.LDC2009T13	Amnesty describes China as one of the world's "enemies of the Internet".
3261	AFP_ENG_20080730.0574.LDC2009T13	Last year China introduced new regulations relaxing general media curbs for foreign journalists in the run-up to the Games.
3262	AFP_ENG_20080730.0574.LDC2009T13	However, domestic journalists, who work under strict censorship, were not included in the measures to relax reporting restrictions, nor were they promised any greater Internet freedoms during the Games.

3264	AFP_ENG_20080803.0214.LDC2009T13	The Olympic torch relay made its way through southwest Sichuan province on Sunday, three months after the area was devastated by a huge earthquake, state media said.
3265	AFP_ENG_20080803.0214.LDC2009T13	The torch passed through the village of Guang'an, the home of former Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping, who instigated many of the economic reforms that sparked the country's economic boom, the Xinhua news agency reported.
3266	AFP_ENG_20080803.0214.LDC2009T13	The 90-minute leg of the relay started after a minute's silence in memory of the victims of the 8.0-magnitude quake, which left close to 90,000 people dead or missing.
3267	AFP_ENG_20080803.0214.LDC2009T13	The leg was started by female policewoman Jiang Min, who took part in the rescue effort after the May 12 quake and who lost 10 relatives in the disaster, Xinhua said.
3268	AFP_ENG_20080803.0214.LDC2009T13	Originally the torch was scheduled to pass through Sichuan between 15-18 June, but the quake forced a change of plan.
3269	AFP_ENG_20080803.0214.LDC2009T13	The torch will stay in the province until Tuesday, when it heads to Beijing.
3270	AFP_ENG_20080803.0214.LDC2009T13	During its Sichuan leg it will pass through Mianyang, one of the towns worst hit by the quake.

3274	AFP_ENG_20080805.0321.LDC2009T13	The move, accounting for some 10 percent of the plant's employees, was the largest ever workforce reduction by the unit.
3275	AFP_ENG_20080805.0321.LDC2009T13	"The cut was mainly due to a slump in sales in the North American market, which forced us to cut production," a company official said, adding that the company plans to raise the number of jobs later this year.

3277	AFP_ENG_20080805.0321.LDC2009T13	About 60 percent of them are exported to North America.
3278	AFP_ENG_20080805.0321.LDC2009T13	Toyota said Friday its US sales slumped 18.7 percent in July from a year ago as it struggled to meet fierce demand for fuel- efficient vehicles.

3305	AFP_ENG_20080810.0417.LDC2009T13	Kirsty Coventry followed up an impressive silver medal finish in the 400m individual medley Sunday with a near-record swim in the heats of the women's 100m backstroke at the Beijing Olympics.
3306	AFP_ENG_20080810.0417.LDC2009T13	Coventry, who finished runner-up in the 400m medley final behind world record- breaker Stephanie Rice of Australia, was also under the previous world mark in that demanding race.
3307	AFP_ENG_20080810.0417.LDC2009T13	The Zimbabwean bounced back easily, however, in the evening heats at the Water Cube, where - swimming next to world record-holder and Athens gold medallist Natalie Coughlin of the United States - Coventry finished in 59.00sec, just three-hundredths outside of Coughlin's world mark.
3308	AFP_ENG_20080810.0417.LDC2009T13	Coughlin swam a controlled 59.69, fourth fastest of the evening, with Japan's Reiko Nakamura (59.36) and Russian Anastasia Zueva (59.61) recording the second- and third-quickest times.
3309	AFP_ENG_20080810.0417.LDC2009T13	"I think I was still running off the adrenalin and was a bit hyper from this morning, so I didn't have to build up too much energy for that race," said Coventry, who won a gold, silver and bronze in Athens.
3310	AFP_ENG_20080810.0417.LDC2009T13	"Tomorrow in the semi-finals you are going to see some really fast times, and it'll be even faster for the final," predicted Coventry, who is trying to improve on her silver-medal finish behind Coughlin in this event in Athens.
3311	AFP_ENG_20080810.0417.LDC2009T13	"I have my work cut out here - the women's 100m backstroke has been the fastest progressing event in the past year in swimming," said Coughlin, who lowered the world record twice at the US trials.
3312	AFP_ENG_20080810.0417.LDC2009T13	"There is some pressure on me, but I will enjoy it and do my best," said Coughlin, who is trying to become the first repeat Olympic champion in the event.
3313	AFP_ENG_20080810.0417.LDC2009T13	So far, Coughlin said, she was enjoying the unusual format of morning finals and evening heats, designed to let US broadcaster NBC showcase record-chasing Michael Phelps's finals in prime viewing time back home.
3314	AFP_ENG_20080810.0417.LDC2009T13	"It's only been the second day, but I kind of like the evening prelims, it gives me a chance to rest before the finals," Coughlin said.
3315	AFP_ENG_20080810.0417.LDC2009T13	"It's harder to rest in between when you have morning heats and evening finals.

3389	AFP_ENG_20080821.0954.LDC2009T13	The reaction would have been even worse if Joe Cole hadn't scrambled home an equaliser deep into stoppage time to deny the Czechs a first win at the English national stadium.

3406	AFP_ENG_20080821.0954.LDC2009T13	Capello did concede that the Czechs had exposed England's weakness against quick counter-attacks.
3407	AFP_ENG_20080821.0954.LDC2009T13	"There was only one thing I didn't like, in the first half: sometimes, when the Czechs had counter-attacks, we suffered," he said.

3409	AFP_ENG_20080821.0954.LDC2009T13	We have to prepare something to combat that problem.

3412	AFP_ENG_20080821.0954.LDC2009T13	John Terry, Capello's newly appointed captain, looked strangely hesitant for much of the match and was at fault for Milan Baros's opener.
3413	AFP_ENG_20080821.0954.LDC2009T13	But the Chelsea defender gave an honest assessment of the performance and warned his team-mates they will have to improve by September.
3414	AFP_ENG_20080821.0954.LDC2009T13	"I think overall we expected more from the game but there are some positives and some negatives and we will sit down and analyse them," Terry said.
3415	AFP_ENG_20080821.0954.LDC2009T13	"Maybe we should have won the game with the team we had there and now there are two weeks to go to reassess the game before the qualifying game against Andorra.

3425	AFP_ENG_20080824.0548.LDC2009T13	Celtic manager Gordon Strachan says he won't be rushed into making any moves in the transfer market despite the threat of being without his two top-scorers from last season for next week's Old Firm match.Scott McDonald, who bagged 31 goals in his first season after joining from Motherwell, missed Celtic's 3-0 weekend victory against Falkirk with a groin strain.
3426	AFP_ENG_20080824.0548.LDC2009T13	The Australian striker is a doubt for next week's derby match against Rangers, with the sides level at the top of the Scottish Premier League after three games.
3427	AFP_ENG_20080824.0548.LDC2009T13	Strike partner Jan Vennegoor of Hesselink was stretchered off during the match against Falkirk after receiving a deep cut to his lower leg following a clash with Lee Bullen.
3428	AFP_ENG_20080824.0548.LDC2009T13	The pair, who struck 51 goals between them last season, would be a major loss for the champions for their match against their arch-rivals.
3429	AFP_ENG_20080824.0548.LDC2009T13	But Strachan says he doesn't feel under pressure to buy new strikers as his side managed to score three without them against Falkirk.
3430	AFP_ENG_20080824.0548.LDC2009T13	He said: "We're not really looking to bring in new players but we might do if there is something that is a good deal.

3432	AFP_ENG_20080824.0548.LDC2009T13	"But we had McDonald and Hesselink playing the last few games and they only scored one and they didn't play against Falkirk and we scored three."
3433	AFP_ENG_20080824.0548.LDC2009T13	And the Hoops gaffer said they would give 24-year-old McDonald every chance of making the Old Firm match after his withdrawal from the squad for the Falkirk match.
3434	AFP_ENG_20080824.0548.LDC2009T13	"His injury came as a surprise to us as he trained on Friday morning.
3435	AFP_ENG_20080824.0548.LDC2009T13	I thought there was something wrong with his ankle but it's his abductor muscle so we've got to have a look at that," Strachan added.

3440	AFP_ENG_20080824.0548.LDC2009T13	On Saturday Celtic cruised to a comfortable 3-0 win at Parkhead to send them top of the SPL.
3441	AFP_ENG_20080824.0548.LDC2009T13	Shaun Maloney made his return at Celtic as a first-half substitute and he had a hand in all three goals.
3442	AFP_ENG_20080824.0548.LDC2009T13	The diminutive forward, on for the injured Jan Vennegoor of Hesselink, won a controversial free-kick on the right following a soft foul after 30 minutes.
3443	AFP_ENG_20080824.0548.LDC2009T13	Shunsuke Nakamura floated the free-kick into the box and McManus' header found its way into the net despite Robert Olejnik getting a hand to it.
3444	AFP_ENG_20080824.0548.LDC2009T13	Celtic increased their lead in the 44th minute and Maloney was involved again.
3445	AFP_ENG_20080824.0548.LDC2009T13	He played a beautifully threaded through ball to Greek striker Georgios Samaras who rounded the keeper and rolled the ball into the net.
3446	AFP_ENG_20080824.0548.LDC2009T13	Maloney should have marked his Parkhead return with a goal in the 54th minute when he broke clear into the box but his effort was wide.
3447	AFP_ENG_20080824.0548.LDC2009T13	Falkirk's Mark Stewart had a chance in the 60th minute after Michael Higdon rolled the ball to him at the edge of the box but his weak effort was straight at Boruc.
3448	AFP_ENG_20080824.0548.LDC2009T13	Samaras scored his second of the day in the 67th minute after good link-up play with Maloney.
3449	AFP_ENG_20080824.0548.LDC2009T13	He played a clever backheel into the path of Samaras, whose soft effort found its way under Olejnik.

3451	AFP_ENG_20080826.0639.LDC2009T13	US, Israel claim peace talks progress despite settlements by Lachlan Carmichael
3452	AFP_ENG_20080826.0639.LDC2009T13	The United States and Israel said on Tuesday that Israeli- Palestinian peace talks were making progress despite what the Jewish state referred to as its small and limited settlement activities.Visiting US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and her Israeli counterpart Tzipi Livni both struck upbeat notes despite the lack of tangible progress in a peace process launched last November in the United States.
3453	AFP_ENG_20080826.0639.LDC2009T13	"We continue to find the way to reach an agreement between Israel and the Palestinians," Livni, flanked by Rice, told reporters at a brief news conference.
3454	AFP_ENG_20080826.0639.LDC2009T13	"Even in these hectic days we continue to negotiate."
3455	AFP_ENG_20080826.0639.LDC2009T13	Amid jockeying for power in Israel, Rice was making her first visit since Prime Minister Ehud Olmert said on July 30 that he will resign to battle corruption charges after his Kadima party chooses a new leader in September.
3456	AFP_ENG_20080826.0639.LDC2009T13	Foreign Minister Livni, who leads Israel's negotiating team with the Palestinians, is a front-runner to replace him, as is Transport Minister Shaul Mofaz, a hawkish former general.
3457	AFP_ENG_20080826.0639.LDC2009T13	Rice said progress was being made despite difficulties, and she was "very heartened by the fact that the negotiations are serious and they are intensive.
3458	AFP_ENG_20080826.0639.LDC2009T13	"In fact I believe that the parties have succeeded in moving their understandings of what needs to be achieved and indeed their positions somewhat closer together over this period of time," Rice said.
3459	AFP_ENG_20080826.0639.LDC2009T13	But in the latest sign of the difficulties faced by the talks the Israeli settlement watchdog Peace Now released a report saying that construction of settlements in the occupied territories has doubled since last year.
3460	AFP_ENG_20080826.0639.LDC2009T13	"Construction in the settlements has increased by a factor of 1.8 by comparison to the same period last year," the group said in a report, citing government statistics.
3461	AFP_ENG_20080826.0639.LDC2009T13	"The housing ministry initiated 433 new housing units during the period of January to May 2008, compared to just 240 units during the period January to May 2007," it said.
3462	AFP_ENG_20080826.0639.LDC2009T13	The international community considers all settlement projects in the occupied territories to be illegal and the Palestinians have repeatedly said that the expansion of settlements is the greatest obstacle to peace.
3463	AFP_ENG_20080826.0639.LDC2009T13	Livni played down the impact of the activity.
3464	AFP_ENG_20080826.0639.LDC2009T13	"I would like to suggest to my partners not to use it as an excuse and I know they are not using it as an excuse but I understand their frustration sometimes," Israel's top diplomat said.
3465	AFP_ENG_20080826.0639.LDC2009T13	"But at the end of the day the Israeli government's policy is not to expand settlements, not to build new settlements and not to confiscate Palestinian land," she said.
3466	AFP_ENG_20080826.0639.LDC2009T13	"There were some small activities but they will not influence the ability (to negotiate), nor the future of the future borders of the Palestinian state."
3467	AFP_ENG_20080826.0639.LDC2009T13	Rice again said the settlements were "unhelpful" to the peace process because they could prejudice the outcome of negotiations aimed at determining the borders of a future Palestinian state.
3468	AFP_ENG_20080826.0639.LDC2009T13	"In fact what we need now are steps that enhance confidence between the parties and that anything that undermines confidence between the parties ought to be avoided," Rice said.
3469	AFP_ENG_20080826.0639.LDC2009T13	"And we will continue to press ahead to get agreement so that we know what is in Israel and what is Palestinian," she said.
3470	AFP_ENG_20080826.0639.LDC2009T13	Rice left the news conference for talks with Livni and former Palestinian prime minister Ahmed Qorei, who heads the Palestinian negotiating team, before meeting Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas in the West Bank.

3475	AFP_ENG_20080827.0418.LDC2009T13	"I am going to miss playing for the club greatly," said Mushtaq, who last competed for his country in 2003.

3479	AFP_ENG_20080827.0418.LDC2009T13	"My love, my feelings and my heart will always be with Sussex and I will always pray to Allah for continued success at Sussex."
3480	AFP_ENG_20080827.0418.LDC2009T13	Club captain Chris Adams said: "Mushtaq's legacy at the club is that he leaves us statistically, romantically and emotionally the best player to ever pull on a Sussex shirt.
3481	AFP_ENG_20080827.0418.LDC2009T13	"In view of the impact he's made, it's difficult to think of another cricketer who has achieved or done more for one county.

3484	AFP_ENG_20080827.0418.LDC2009T13	Mark Robinson, the county's cricket manager, added: "I don't think that it will ever be possible to overplay the enormous influence Mushtaq has had on Sussex in recent years.
3485	AFP_ENG_20080827.0418.LDC2009T13	"His record as a player and the trophies that he has helped us win will speak for itself, but I would like to pay tribute to him as a person from myself and all the people whose lives he has touched for the enormous influence he has had on us."

3524	AFP_ENG_20080914.0207.LDC2009T13	Australia international Tim Cahill marked his return to the Everton side with the winning goal in their 3-2 Premier League victory away to top-flight newboys Stoke City here Sunday.
3525	AFP_ENG_20080914.0207.LDC2009T13	Everton, who had been 2-0 up before the hosts fought back to 2-2, scored the decisive fifth goal of the match in the 77th minute when the midfielder eluded the Stoke defence to flick in a corner from Mikel Arteta.
3526	AFP_ENG_20080914.0207.LDC2009T13	"That's what Tim does.
3527	AFP_ENG_20080914.0207.LDC2009T13	He scores important goals for us and he's won us the game today," Everton manager David Moyes who was sent to the stands by referee Alan Wiley.
3528	AFP_ENG_20080914.0207.LDC2009T13	"It's a good afternoon to get three points.
3529	AFP_ENG_20080914.0207.LDC2009T13	Here it's very hard."
3530	AFP_ENG_20080914.0207.LDC2009T13	Cahill hadn't played since March because of a broken foot and missed the start of the new season as well as Australia's opening World Cup qualifier in Uzbekistan in midweek.
3531	AFP_ENG_20080914.0207.LDC2009T13	The 28-year-old scored 10 league goals last season and played a crucial role in helping Everton to fifth place in the table and a spot in the UEFA Cup.
3532	AFP_ENG_20080914.0207.LDC2009T13	This victory took the Toffees into the top half of the Premier League but left Stoke with only basement club Tottenham, who play Aston Villa on Monday, below them in the table.
3533	AFP_ENG_20080914.0207.LDC2009T13	Goals either side of half-time from Nigerian internationals Yakubu and Victor Anichebe put the visitors ahead and seemingly in control.
3534	AFP_ENG_20080914.0207.LDC2009T13	But Stoke got back into the game soon after the visitors' second with a goal from another Nigerian, Seyi Olofinjana, before Mark Jagielka put through his own net in the 63rd minute.
3535	AFP_ENG_20080914.0207.LDC2009T13	Both teams had cause to rue a couple of controversial decisions by Wiley.
3536	AFP_ENG_20080914.0207.LDC2009T13	First Stoke were denied a seemingly good goal when Ricardo Fuller, after rounding Tim Howard in the 59th minute and slotting the ball into the net, was penalised for making contact on Joseph Yobo.
3537	AFP_ENG_20080914.0207.LDC2009T13	Everton were as incensed when Wiley, who had pointed to the penalty spot, changed his mind after consulting his linesman and instead gave a free-kick on the edge of the box, when it appeared Stoke's Leon Cort had handled inside the penalty area.
3538	AFP_ENG_20080914.0207.LDC2009T13	Soon afterwards a furious Moyes, having berated the fourth official, was sent to the stands.
3539	AFP_ENG_20080914.0207.LDC2009T13	"The referee pointed to the spot and from where I was standing he (Cort) was two yards inside (the box)," said Moyes.
3540	AFP_ENG_20080914.0207.LDC2009T13	"I've not had a chance to see it yet.
3541	AFP_ENG_20080914.0207.LDC2009T13	If I'm wrong, I'll apologise to him.
3542	AFP_ENG_20080914.0207.LDC2009T13	I would probably expect the same from him (Wiley)," the Scot added.
3543	AFP_ENG_20080914.0207.LDC2009T13	A match that had been full of endeavour, with Stoke's aerial threat a persistent problem for the Everton defence, received a much-needed injection of class in the 41st minute.
3544	AFP_ENG_20080914.0207.LDC2009T13	Arteta's clever reverse-pass found Cahill and his precise ball released Yakubu who calmly slotted home past City goalkeeper Thomas Sorensen.
3545	AFP_ENG_20080914.0207.LDC2009T13	Neither side looked comfortable when defending set-pieces and Everton doubled their lead in the 51st minute when the unmarked Anichebe's glancing header from Arteta's free-kick gave Sorensen no chance.
3546	AFP_ENG_20080914.0207.LDC2009T13	Stoke, however, fought back after Everton failed to deal with two long throws.
3547	AFP_ENG_20080914.0207.LDC2009T13	First Everton keeper Tim Howard could only punch weakly as he came to deal with Rory Delap's throw and Olofinjana volleyed the ball back fiercely past the American.
3548	AFP_ENG_20080914.0207.LDC2009T13	Another Delap delivery caused problems when Jagielka headed past Howard at the near post and Stoke were level.
3549	AFP_ENG_20080914.0207.LDC2009T13	But just when Tony Pulis's side thought they might be on course for a memorable victory, Cahill headed in from eight yards.

3551	AFP_ENG_20080915.0720.LDC2009T13	Shaking as she recalled her brutal beating at the hands of Jewish ultra-Orthodox vigilantes, a 28-year-old Jerusalem woman who would only identify herself as M. said she feared for her life.
3552	AFP_ENG_20080915.0720.LDC2009T13	Some residents say the self-styled "modesty squads" are spreading terror among those seen as straying from the strict moral code demanded of the ultra-Orthodox in the more conservative neighbourhoods of the Holy City.
3553	AFP_ENG_20080915.0720.LDC2009T13	There life revolves largely around the study of holy texts and a strict dress code that has men sporting black coats and wide- brimmed hats and women covering their heads, arms and legs.
3554	AFP_ENG_20080915.0720.LDC2009T13	Two weeks ago police arrested two alleged members of a modesty patrol accused of brutally beating M.
3555	AFP_ENG_20080915.0720.LDC2009T13	The gang allegedly gagged her, hit her, kicked her and said she would be killed if she did not move out of the ultra-Orthodox Maalot Dafna neighbourhood.
3556	AFP_ENG_20080915.0720.LDC2009T13	"They beat me up, tied me up and threatened to kill me," M. said, holding back her tears.
3557	AFP_ENG_20080915.0720.LDC2009T13	"Who will prevent them from killing me?"
3558	AFP_ENG_20080915.0720.LDC2009T13	Neighbours had complained of what they called the divorcee's "indecent" lifestyle, which in such neighbourhoods can mean anything from wearing trousers to meeting men in private.
3559	AFP_ENG_20080915.0720.LDC2009T13	"I don't know why I was treated this way.
3560	AFP_ENG_20080915.0720.LDC2009T13	What has my life got to do with those guys," said M., who until three years ago was married to a Haredi -- a word used to describe the most theologically conservative form of Judaism.
3561	AFP_ENG_20080915.0720.LDC2009T13	Police have also detained a man accused of torching a store in an ultra-Orthodox district that sold what some residents considered "immoral" clothing.
3562	AFP_ENG_20080915.0720.LDC2009T13	In Mea Shearim, a Haredi bastion where streets are sealed off for the Jewish day of rest and satellite dishes are considered a sign of heresy, an electronics store has become the latest target of the morality squads.
3563	AFP_ENG_20080915.0720.LDC2009T13	-- This shop corrupts neighborhood youth --
3564	AFP_ENG_20080915.0720.LDC2009T13	A young man, sporting the distinctive Haredi sidecurls, beard, black garb and hat, stood outside the store handing out pamphlets.
3565	AFP_ENG_20080915.0720.LDC2009T13	He said the store was threatening the morals of the community by selling MP4 players that would allow buyers to view indecent movies in their homes.
3566	AFP_ENG_20080915.0720.LDC2009T13	"This shop corrupts the neighbourhood youth," the man said.
3567	AFP_ENG_20080915.0720.LDC2009T13	"We will fight until they stop selling these impure devices."
3568	AFP_ENG_20080915.0720.LDC2009T13	David, a salesman at the store, said he is an Orthodox Jew but believes that the protesters who have picketed outside for weeks "are spreading terror in the neighbourhood".
3569	AFP_ENG_20080915.0720.LDC2009T13	"They burned down our stocks, nothing will stop them," he said, declining to give his family name for fear of being singled out for attack.
3570	AFP_ENG_20080915.0720.LDC2009T13	In June, a 14-year-old Mea Sharim resident was taken to hospital with burns after an attacker hurled acid at her.
3571	AFP_ENG_20080915.0720.LDC2009T13	Israeli media said that at the time of the attack the girl had been wearing loose-fitting trousers and a short-sleeved shirt, enough to provoke the ire of religious fanatics.
3572	AFP_ENG_20080915.0720.LDC2009T13	In 2006, a 50-year-old American-Israeli woman was viciously attacked by four men because she refused to go to the back of a bus while on holiday in Jerusalem.
3573	AFP_ENG_20080915.0720.LDC2009T13	The bus was not one of the sex-segregated lines Jerusalem runs to accommodate Haredi preferences.
3574	AFP_ENG_20080915.0720.LDC2009T13	In addition to violence within the Haredi community, Israel has also seen tensions between religious and secular Jews over the course of its 60-year history.
3575	AFP_ENG_20080915.0720.LDC2009T13	The ultra-Orthodox have led violent protests against swimming pools, cinemas and other establishments they consider immoral for failing to segregate the sexes or sacrilegious for opening on the Sabbath.
3576	AFP_ENG_20080915.0720.LDC2009T13	Meny Schwartz, who heads the religious Kol Haredi radio station, said the modesty patrols have been around for years, with the full approval of religious leaders, but appear to have become increasingly violent.

3584	AFP_ENG_20080917.0222.LDC2009T13	A preliminary report into last month's Spanair plane crash in Madrid which killed 154 people contains "imprecisions," a senior airline official has said.
3585	AFP_ENG_20080917.0222.LDC2009T13	The report said that the airline failed to perform a routine check recommended by the manufacturer, but Spanair director of operations Javier Muela rejected its initial findings in an interview with radio Cadena Ser late on Tuesday.
3586	AFP_ENG_20080917.0222.LDC2009T13	"It seems to us very preliminary at the moment, full of many imprecisions," Muela said.
3587	AFP_ENG_20080917.0222.LDC2009T13	Spanish media published leaked extracts of the report on Tuesday which said the MD-82's wing flaps were not properly extended when it attempted to take off, causing it to lose altitude and land on its tail before catching fire.
3588	AFP_ENG_20080917.0222.LDC2009T13	The pilots were not aware of the problem until it was too late because a warning alarm failed to work, according to segments of the report published in daily newspapers El Pais and El Mundo.
3589	AFP_ENG_20080917.0222.LDC2009T13	Boeing began recommending that the warning system be checked by pilots before every flight following the crash of another MD-82 plane, in 1987 in Detroit, USA, that also killed 154 people, the newspapers reported.
3590	AFP_ENG_20080917.0222.LDC2009T13	Spanair, however, only asks its pilots to verify the alarm before the first flight of the day and after a change in the pilot team, they said.
3591	AFP_ENG_20080917.0222.LDC2009T13	The plane had carried out an earlier flight from Barcelona with the same crew.
3592	AFP_ENG_20080917.0222.LDC2009T13	Muela also said that Boeing made the recommendation one year before Spanair, a unit of Scandinavian carrier SAS, was set up in 1988 and it was not informed by the plane maker of the need to verify the alarm.
3593	AFP_ENG_20080917.0222.LDC2009T13	It is company policy is to check the flaps three times before every flight, he added.
3594	AFP_ENG_20080917.0222.LDC2009T13	Only 18 people survived after the packed plane slammed into the ground and burst into flames just seconds after taking off August 20 from Madrid's airport for Las Palmas in Spain's Canary Islands.

3597	AFP_ENG_20080919.0655.LDC2009T13	North Korea is preparing to restart its Yongbyon nuclear reactor amid a deadlock in international disarmament talks, a Pyongyang official said Friday.
3598	AFP_ENG_20080919.0655.LDC2009T13	"We are making thorough preparations to restore (nuclear facilities)," said foreign ministry official Hyon Hak-Bong.
3599	AFP_ENG_20080919.0655.LDC2009T13	"You may say we have already started work to restore them," he told reporters at the border truce village of Panmunjom before the start of talks between the two Koreas on energy aid.
3600	AFP_ENG_20080919.0655.LDC2009T13	North Korea said last month it had stopped disabling the plutonium-producing reactor and other plants and would consider restoring them, in protest at Washington's refusal to drop it from a terrorism blacklist.
3601	AFP_ENG_20080919.0655.LDC2009T13	The North's negotiating partners have reported that equipment was being moved back to the site.
3602	AFP_ENG_20080919.0655.LDC2009T13	Asked by reporters when the reactor would be restarted, Hyon replied: "You'll come to know soon."
3603	AFP_ENG_20080919.0655.LDC2009T13	As part of a six-nation aid-for-disarmament agreement, the North last November began disabling its Yongbyon plants.
3604	AFP_ENG_20080919.0655.LDC2009T13	In return the five negotiating partners -- South Korea, the United States, Japan, China and Russia -- promised to provide one million tons of heavy fuel oil or equivalent energy assistance to the impoverished communist state.
3605	AFP_ENG_20080919.0655.LDC2009T13	In June the North handed over a list of its nuclear programmes and facilities and the United States began the process of removing it from a terrorism blacklist.
3606	AFP_ENG_20080919.0655.LDC2009T13	But Washington says it will not take the final step until the North agrees on ways to verify its nuclear declaration.
3607	AFP_ENG_20080919.0655.LDC2009T13	Hyon, deputy chief of the foreign ministry's US affairs bureau, said Washington should stop demanding an "unacceptable" verification regime and immediately take Pyongyang off the blacklist.
3608	AFP_ENG_20080919.0655.LDC2009T13	He said Washington's request for a thorough inspection was reminiscent of its pre-war activity in Iraq.
3609	AFP_ENG_20080919.0655.LDC2009T13	The US ransacked Iraq, insisting weapons of mass destruction existed there, based on false intelligence reports, he said.
3610	AFP_ENG_20080919.0655.LDC2009T13	He said the North was not required to agree to a verification system for its nuclear declaration because verification was not stipulated in the six-party talks.
3611	AFP_ENG_20080919.0655.LDC2009T13	"There isn't any agreement or secret diplomatic memorandum of understanding (on verification) between North Korea and the US.
3612	AFP_ENG_20080919.0655.LDC2009T13	It is not in a six-party agreement."
3613	AFP_ENG_20080919.0655.LDC2009T13	On August 26 the North announced that in protest it had halted disablement work and would consider restarting the reactor.
3614	AFP_ENG_20080919.0655.LDC2009T13	Nearly half of the promised energy aid has been delivered.
3615	AFP_ENG_20080919.0655.LDC2009T13	Officials from the two Koreas were meeting Friday to discuss further deliveries.
3616	AFP_ENG_20080919.0655.LDC2009T13	Hwang Joon-Kook, head of the South Korean foreign ministry's North Korean nuclear issue bureau, heads the Seoul delegation.
3617	AFP_ENG_20080919.0655.LDC2009T13	In London the International Institute for Strategic Studies said Thursday that North Korea could put its nuclear programme back on track in less than a year.
3618	AFP_ENG_20080919.0655.LDC2009T13	Uncertainty over the health of leader Kim Jong-Il means its stalemate with Washington over its nuclear programme is likely to continue, it added.
3619	AFP_ENG_20080919.0655.LDC2009T13	"Diplomatic efforts to stem the nuclear proliferation challenges posed by Iran and North Korea are both deadlocked," IISS chief John Chipman said.

3653	AFP_ENG_20080930.0455.LDC2009T13	US negotiator Christopher Hill arrived Tuesday in Seoul and will travel on to Pyongyang in an attempt to save a North Korean nuclear disarmament deal that appears close to collapse.
3654	AFP_ENG_20080930.0455.LDC2009T13	Hill leaves for the communist state Wednesday at the invitation of its leaders, in a bid to settle an intractable dispute about verification of the North's nuclear disclosures.

3668	AFP_ENG_20081001.0536.LDC2009T13	Pakistani Taliban leader Mehsud seriously ill: officials, militants
3669	AFP_ENG_20081001.0536.LDC2009T13	Pakistani Taliban chief Baitullah Mehsud is seriously ill with diabetes and may even be in a coma, security officials and militant commanders close to the Al- Qaeda-linked warlord said Wednesday.
3670	AFP_ENG_20081001.0536.LDC2009T13	Local television reported that Mehsud, the head of the country's umbrella Taliban organisation, Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan, had died overnight -- but officials and militant sources insisted he was still alive.
3671	AFP_ENG_20081001.0536.LDC2009T13	The shadowy Mehsud was accused by the previous government and by US intelligence of masterminding the slaying of former premier Benazir Bhutto in December 2007.
3672	AFP_ENG_20081001.0536.LDC2009T13	He denies any involvement.
3673	AFP_ENG_20081001.0536.LDC2009T13	"Baitullah is sick.
3674	AFP_ENG_20081001.0536.LDC2009T13	His condition is precarious," a senior Pakistani security official told AFP on condition of anonymity.
3675	AFP_ENG_20081001.0536.LDC2009T13	Mehsud is based in the lawless South Waziristan tribal area bordering Afghanistan and independent verification of his condition was impossible.
3676	AFP_ENG_20081001.0536.LDC2009T13	The father of a woman to whom Mehsud was recently engaged to be married -- it would be his second wife -- told friends Mehsud was "in a coma", security officials said.
3677	AFP_ENG_20081001.0536.LDC2009T13	A senior Taliban commander close to Mehsud confirmed that he was ill but insisted he would pull through.
3678	AFP_ENG_20081001.0536.LDC2009T13	"He is only suffering from a bout of diabetes.
3679	AFP_ENG_20081001.0536.LDC2009T13	He is under treatment but he will be all right," commander Rahim Burki told AFP.
3680	AFP_ENG_20081001.0536.LDC2009T13	Another commander said Mehsud required frequent medical care.
3681	AFP_ENG_20081001.0536.LDC2009T13	"Baitullah needs medical attention two or three times a week and he is growing weaker," the commander, named Razaq, told AFP.
3682	AFP_ENG_20081002.0194.LDC2009T13	Britain's top cop quits after racism, shooting rows
3683	AFP_ENG_20081002.0194.LDC2009T13	Britain's top policeman, Metropolitan Police chief Ian Blair, announced his resignation Thursday after months of mounting pressure, notably over racism allegations and a mistaken killing.
3684	AFP_ENG_20081002.0194.LDC2009T13	Blair, who came to office shortly before suicide bombings in London in July 2005, said he had lost the backing of new London mayor Boris Johnson,, who took office in May.
3685	AFP_ENG_20081002.0194.LDC2009T13	"I have today offered my resignation as commissioner to the Home Secretary, .
3686	AFP_ENG_20081002.0194.LDC2009T13	.
3687	AFP_ENG_20081002.0194.LDC2009T13	she has reluctantly but graciously accepted," he told a hastily-arranged press conference, adding that he would stand down on December 1.
3688	AFP_ENG_20081002.0194.LDC2009T13	"Without the mayor's backing I do not consider that I can continue in the job," he added.
3689	AFP_ENG_20081002.0194.LDC2009T13	Blair has long faced criticism over the death of Jean Charles de Menezes, an innocent Brazilian shot dead by police who mistook him for a suicide bomber in the wake of July 2005 bombings in London, which killed 56.
3690	AFP_ENG_20081002.0194.LDC2009T13	Then in August the Met's top Muslim officer, Assistant Commissioner Tarique Ghaffur, confirmed that he was taking Blair to an employment tribunal over alleged racism.
3691	AFP_ENG_20081002.0194.LDC2009T13	And a new media report Thursday claimed that Blair had used public money to pay a close friend more than 15,000 pounds (26,400 dollars, 19,000 euros) to help him sharpen up his image when he became Met chief in 2005.
3692	AFP_ENG_20081002.0194.LDC2009T13	The Daily Mail reported that the friend, who had known Blair for 30 years, was the owner of a company that won a contract to help him "make the transition."
3693	AFP_ENG_20081002.0194.LDC2009T13	The friend had received more than three million pounds' worth of police contract work.
3694	AFP_ENG_20081002.0194.LDC2009T13	The Guardian newspaper said on its online version that it had been the Daily Mail report that had apparently prompted Blair's expected resignation.
3695	AFP_ENG_20081002.0194.LDC2009T13	The De Menezes killing has been the main cloud hanging over him.
3696	AFP_ENG_20081002.0194.LDC2009T13	Scotland Yard was heavily criticised in a report in August 2007 on the killing, although Blair himself escaped censure.
3697	AFP_ENG_20081002.0194.LDC2009T13	The pressure mounted on him last November after his police force was found guilty of breaching health and safety laws in the shooting.
3698	AFP_ENG_20081002.0194.LDC2009T13	But he fought off calls for his resignation, saying officers had done their best in a "simply extraordinary situation."
3699	AFP_ENG_20081002.0194.LDC2009T13	An inquest into the killing is currently underway in London.
3700	AFP_ENG_20081002.0194.LDC2009T13	Some commentators feel that Blair's position was made less secure by the election of conservative Johnson as London mayor.
3701	AFP_ENG_20081002.0194.LDC2009T13	Former mayor Ken Livingstone had staunchly defended Blair through repeated storms, but Johnson was clearly cooler, and has not publicly backed the Met chief.
3702	AFP_ENG_20081002.0194.LDC2009T13	Among the favourites to succeed him is Hugh Orde, the chief constable of the Police Service of Northern Ireland

3775	AFP_ENG_20081008.0453.LDC2009T13	The United States is well placed to rebound from the current financial crisis because of its inherent competitive advantages, the World Economic Forum said on Wednesday.
3776	AFP_ENG_20081008.0453.LDC2009T13	The WEF, which hosts the annual Davos pow-wow of business and political leaders, ranked the United States number one in its annual competitiveness survey despite the financial turmoil which has seen Wall Street titans humbled and the taxpayer bailing out banks to the tune of 700 billion dollars.
3777	AFP_ENG_20081008.0453.LDC2009T13	"Despite the financial crisis, the United States continues to be the most competitive economy in the world," the WEF said in its report.
3778	AFP_ENG_20081008.0453.LDC2009T13	"This is because it is endowed with many structural features that make its economy extremely productive and place it on a strong footing to ride out business cycle shifts and economic shocks," it said.
3779	AFP_ENG_20081008.0453.LDC2009T13	WEF economist Thierry Geiger said that the country excels in its "capacity to innovate, the quality of its institutions, the efficiency of government in relation to expenditure, the independence of the judiciary, low levels of corruption and the flexibility of the goods and labour markets."
3780	AFP_ENG_20081008.0453.LDC2009T13	"The United States is well placed to bounce back from the crisis," Geiger told AFP.

3782	AFP_ENG_20081008.0453.LDC2009T13	The US is still the future," he said.

3784	AFP_ENG_20081008.0453.LDC2009T13	"The United States has built up large macroeconomic imbalances over recent years, with repeated fiscal deficits leading to rising and burgeoning levels of public indebtedness," it said.
3785	AFP_ENG_20081008.0453.LDC2009T13	"This indicates that the country is not preparing financially for its future liabilities and is on the road to making interest payments that will increasingly restrict its fiscal policy freedom going into the future," it added.

3787	AFP_ENG_20081008.0453.LDC2009T13	Nordic countries also fared well with Denmark in third place, Sweden fourth and Finland sixth, due to their sound macroeconomic environment and low levels of public debt.
3788	AFP_ENG_20081008.0453.LDC2009T13	Britain fell three places to twelth from ninth due to a weakening of its financial markets, while France rose two places to sixteenth and garnered praise from the WEF for its infrastructure and transport networks.

3791	AFP_ENG_20081011.0405.LDC2009T13	European leaders were to meet over the weekend in France in the latest bid to forge a common response to the global banking crisis, moving closer to a British-style plan of partial nationalisation.
3792	AFP_ENG_20081011.0405.LDC2009T13	French President Nicolas Sarkozy and German Chancellor Angela Merkel were to hold talks Saturday at General Charles de Gaulle's graveside in Colombey-les- deux-Eglises and on Sunday the leaders of all 15 eurozone members will gather in Paris.
3793	AFP_ENG_20081011.0405.LDC2009T13	The heads of the European Union's four biggest economies -- Britain, France, Germany and Italy -- met a week ago but Merkel and Sarkozy were split over the need for a common plan.
3794	AFP_ENG_20081011.0405.LDC2009T13	However, after a week of economic turmoil and plunging stock markets, and crisis talks on Friday between the finance ministers of the G7 industrial powers, the single-currency bloc has agreed to try once more to coordinate a response.
3795	AFP_ENG_20081011.0405.LDC2009T13	After the G7 talks in Washington, US Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said his government was ready to invest directly in banks for the first time since the Great Depression in a bid to restore confidence.
3796	AFP_ENG_20081011.0405.LDC2009T13	This move followed the decision by Britain's Prime Minister Gordon Brown to guarantee inter-bank lending and to offer to take stakes in some of the country's biggest banks in a programme of partial nationalisation.
3797	AFP_ENG_20081011.0405.LDC2009T13	Europe, after reluctance in particular from Merkel's Germany, now seems likely to follow London down this route, which bankers hope will restart frozen lending between banks and pump vital liquidity into financial institutions.
3798	AFP_ENG_20081011.0405.LDC2009T13	On Friday, the German daily Die Welt reported that Germany was working on a British-style plan, and a senior European offical told AFP that Brown's idea was a "good one" and would be discussed by the eurozone 15.
3799	AFP_ENG_20081011.0405.LDC2009T13	"It would be smart to follow the British example at the European level," he said, speaking on condition of anonymity so as not to pre-empt the summit.
3800	AFP_ENG_20081011.0405.LDC2009T13	"I spoke to Madame Merkel and I think she's open to a European decision."

3817	AFP_ENG_20081014.0585.LDC2009T13	South Africa's ruling ANC has suspended the former defence minister and will haul him before a disciplinary committee, days after he threatened to form a breakaway party, officials said Tuesday.
3818	AFP_ENG_20081014.0585.LDC2009T13	Mosiuoa Lekota, who resigned as defence minister in September, last week threatened to form a new party and accused the African National Congress (ANC) of abandoning its democratic ideals in the sacking of former president Thabo Mbeki.
3819	AFP_ENG_20081014.0585.LDC2009T13	The ANC's National Working Committee issued a statement late Monday saying that Lekota and his former deputy Mluleki George had been suspended from the party.
3820	AFP_ENG_20081014.0585.LDC2009T13	Party spokesman Jessie Duarte told SA FM radio Tuesday that they would also be hauled before a disciplinary committee, which could take further action.
3821	AFP_ENG_20081014.0585.LDC2009T13	"The National Disciplinary Committee of the African National Congress will call them (to a meeting) and make a decision," Duarte said.
3822	AFP_ENG_20081014.0585.LDC2009T13	Party leaders plan to meet Wednesday to discuss the suspension, the ANC said in a statement.
3823	AFP_ENG_20081014.0585.LDC2009T13	"The ANC will take similar action against any other members who have indicated in words or action their intention to establish a party in opposition to the ANC," the statement said.
3824	AFP_ENG_20081014.0585.LDC2009T13	Lekota and George are supporters of Mbeki, who was forced by the ANC to resign as the nation's president on September 20, just months before the end of his term.
3825	AFP_ENG_20081014.0585.LDC2009T13	Lekota last Wednesday threatened to form a new party that could challenge the ANC in elections next year.
3826	AFP_ENG_20081014.0585.LDC2009T13	Lekota, a former chairman of the party that led the struggle against apartheid, said that he was yet to be formally informed of his suspension.
3827	AFP_ENG_20081014.0585.LDC2009T13	"I do not believe it... I want to wait until I get a letter from the ANC.
3828	AFP_ENG_20081014.0585.LDC2009T13	The constitution of the ANC says that no member can be punished before you hold a hearing," he said on a local television.
3829	AFP_ENG_20081014.0585.LDC2009T13	The threat of a breakaway party marks the latest twist in a long- running power struggle between Mbeki and party boss Jacob Zuma.
3830	AFP_ENG_20081014.0585.LDC2009T13	Zuma unseated Mbeki as party leader last December, in a dramatic upset for the man who succeeded democracy icon Nelson Mandela as South Africa's second president since the end of apartheid.

3845	AFP_ENG_20081017.0435.LDC2009T13	Ieng Sary, 82, who appeared at the court wearing a blue shirt buttoned to the collar, had appealed to be let out of detention on the grounds that he was granted a pardon for a 1979 genocide conviction, and that the jail at the court did not have facilities to care for his frail health.
3846	AFP_ENG_20081017.0435.LDC2009T13	But Judge Prak Kimsan rejected Ieng Sary's appeal, saying that his previous amnesty did not apply to the UN-backed court.

3850	AFP_ENG_20081020.0307.LDC2009T13	Hong Kong-listed appliance maker shut its southern China factory on Monday, state media reported, making it the latest victim of the world economic slowdown's impact on Chinese manufacturing.
3851	AFP_ENG_20081020.0307.LDC2009T13	The closure of Bailingda Industrial Co.'s electrical appliance factory in the export hub of Shenzhen has left 1,500 employees jobless, Xinhua news agency reported.
3852	AFP_ENG_20081020.0307.LDC2009T13	It follows the failure on Friday of another Hong Kong-listed firm, toymaker Smart Union, which shut its factory in the nearby city of Dongguan in Guangdong province, throwing about 7,000 out of work.
3853	AFP_ENG_20081020.0307.LDC2009T13	The situation has highlighted the growing risk of instability in China's coastal manufacturing hubs as factories face financial difficulties leading to large- scale layoffs.
3854	AFP_ENG_20081020.0307.LDC2009T13	Xinhua said more than 1,000 of the laid-off Bailingda employees had gathered outside the factory on Sunday, demanding government intervention to secure unpaid wages.
3855	AFP_ENG_20081020.0307.LDC2009T13	The report made no mention of any disturbances.
3856	AFP_ENG_20081020.0307.LDC2009T13	It said worried Guangdong labour authorities were considering setting up a fund to help workers laid off by factory closures.
3857	AFP_ENG_20081020.0307.LDC2009T13	Smart Union owes its workers at least six weeks' wages each, Hong Kong's South China Morning Post newspaper has reported, citing a company employee.
3858	AFP_ENG_20081020.0307.LDC2009T13	The Smart Union workers crowded around the factory's gates last week seeking news of their jobs and unpaid salaries, prompting the local government to warn them against escalating their action.

3860	AFP_ENG_20081020.0307.LDC2009T13	Rising labour and raw materials costs and the appreciation of China's yuan currency, which makes Chinese-made goods more expensive overseas, are also seen as factors.
3861	AFP_ENG_20081020.0307.LDC2009T13	Chinese state press reported last week that more than half of the nation's toy exporters -- about 3,631 enterprises -- had gone belly up in 2008.

3877	AFP_ENG_20081026.0480.LDC2009T13	His bid drew a crowd of 51,331 that included California Governor and onetime movie strongman Arnold Schwarzeneger, actor Kurt Russell and Joe Torre, former manager of baseball's storied New York Yankees now at the helm of the Los Angeles Dodgers.
3878	AFP_ENG_20081026.0480.LDC2009T13	But it was Raven's Pass, ridden by Frankie Dettori for trainer John Gosden, who pelted to victory on the final straight as Curlin faded to a stunning fourth in the 1 1/4-mile race on Santa Anita's Pro-Ride synthetic track.

3884	AFP_ENG_20081026.0480.LDC2009T13	It was a perfect homecoming for Gosden, who trained here from 1979-1988.

3933	AFP_ENG_20081027.0634.LDC2009T13	"We continue to monitor markets closely and cooperate as appropriate," the statement from their finance ministers and central bank chiefs said.
3934	AFP_ENG_20081027.0634.LDC2009T13	They also warned the yen's volatility posed "possible adverse implications for economic and financial stability," but dealers said the statement had few teeth and may show the G7 had no stomach for intervention.

3949	AFP_ENG_20081028.0653.LDC2009T13	German consumers have shown a comparatively level-headed reaction to ongoing financial turmoil, with a key confidence index compiled by the GfK institute stabilising "at a low level," it said Tuesday.
3950	AFP_ENG_20081028.0653.LDC2009T13	The forecast index edged up to 1.9 points for November from 1.8 points this month, but "in spite of the financial crisis and some turbulent times on the stock market," the consumer climate "appeared to stabilise at a low level," the Nuremberg-based institute said.
3951	AFP_ENG_20081028.0653.LDC2009T13	"Consumers have kept a level head amid the sometimes dramatic developments on the international financial markets, and this is particularly true of their income expectations," GfK said.
3952	AFP_ENG_20081028.0653.LDC2009T13	Fears of a recession have been reinforced, however.
3953	AFP_ENG_20081028.0653.LDC2009T13	"Major contributing factors are the panic on the international stock exchanges, which has shaken consumer confidence in the future economic outlook," it added.
3954	AFP_ENG_20081028.0653.LDC2009T13	That resulted in an economic expectations sub index plunging by 11.8 points to minus 27.5 points, its lowest level since May 2003.
3955	AFP_ENG_20081028.0653.LDC2009T13	The German government expects the economy to grow by just 0.2 percent next year, with the economy ministry noting last week that "weakness of the global economy has weighed on exports," the engine of German growth.
3956	AFP_ENG_20081028.0653.LDC2009T13	And although consumers believed their disposable income was set to rise slightly, their propensity to make large purchases was limited, the study found.
3957	AFP_ENG_20081028.0653.LDC2009T13	The auto and construction sectors have already begun to suffer.
3958	AFP_ENG_20081028.0653.LDC2009T13	German auto makers have curtailed production in certain cases and issued profit warnings in others.
3959	AFP_ENG_20081028.0653.LDC2009T13	The GfK study questioned 2,000 people before signs suggested the initial banking crisis was spreading to the economy in general and before the German government announced a 480-billion-euro (590-billion-dollar) rescue plan for banks.
3960	AFP_ENG_20081028.0653.LDC2009T13	"It remains to be seen whether the bank rescue package proposed by the German government in the meantime will provide for more calm on the stock markets and contribute to a change in consumer mood," GfK noted.
3961	AFP_ENG_20081028.0653.LDC2009T13	Since the poll was taken, global stock markets have fallen further on fears that a global economic recession is at hand.
3962	AFP_ENG_20081028.0653.LDC2009T13	Overall, 2008 will not turn out to be a very good year for German consumers.
3963	AFP_ENG_20081028.0653.LDC2009T13	"All hopes are now being pinned on 2009.
3964	AFP_ENG_20081028.0653.LDC2009T13	It is very much hoped that consumers regain their confidence in the financial markets and that a recession can be avoided," GfK said.
3965	AFP_ENG_20081028.0653.LDC2009T13	German business confidence plunged to a five-year low in October, the widely- watched Ifo business climate index showed Monday, as the world's leading exporter was hit hard by the global financial crisis.

3967	AFP_ENG_20081029.0443.LDC2009T13	Europe's airline industry felt the pinch from the global financial crisis Wednesday as the Denmark-based low-cost carrier Sterling Airways filed for bankruptcy and German giant Lufthansa reported a 75-percent nosedive in net profit.
3968	AFP_ENG_20081029.0443.LDC2009T13	Sterling, which had been in difficulty for several years, announced it was abandoning efforts to keep the airline flying, blaming exposure to the collapse of Iceland's financial sector.
3969	AFP_ENG_20081029.0443.LDC2009T13	"Over a three to four week period, the whole financial system melted down, and that resulted in our shareholder being unable to continue his support to the company," Sterling said in a statement, nearly three months after it was sold to Icelandic business tycoon Palmi Haraldsson.
3970	AFP_ENG_20081029.0443.LDC2009T13	The collapse of the company left passengers left stranded.
3971	AFP_ENG_20081029.0443.LDC2009T13	All flights were cancelled and travellers holding tickets would not be refunded, Sterling said.
3972	AFP_ENG_20081029.0443.LDC2009T13	The company, which was earlier owned by Northern Travel Group, comprised of Icelandic investment groups Fons, FL Group and Sund, would file for bankruptcy later Wednesday, the statement added.
3973	AFP_ENG_20081029.0443.LDC2009T13	Meanwhile, Lufthansa airline reported a 75-percent fall in net profit in the third quarter due to high fuel costs and weakened sales arising from the credit crunch.
3974	AFP_ENG_20081029.0443.LDC2009T13	The airline posted 149 million euros (189 million dollars) in net profit between July and September, after saying Tuesday that it would cut its 2008 operating profit target to 1.1 billion euros from 1.38 billion euros, the same figure it posted last year.
3975	AFP_ENG_20081029.0443.LDC2009T13	Operating profit in the third quarter plunged by 53.4 percent to 279 million euros, the company said in a statement.

3977	AFP_ENG_20081029.0443.LDC2009T13	Net profit during the same period plummeted by 65.1 percent to 551 million euros.
3978	AFP_ENG_20081029.0443.LDC2009T13	The company, however, on Wednesday said it would take a stake of 80 percent in British carrier BMI.
3979	AFP_ENG_20081029.0443.LDC2009T13	The increase from Lufthansa's previous 30-percent stake in BMI, formerly known as British Midland, was the result of an option held by investor Michael Bishop to sell his stake of 50 percent plus one share to the German carrier.
3980	AFP_ENG_20081029.0443.LDC2009T13	Lufthansa's nosedive in profits came as airlines reported some relief from falling oil prices following record highs in July.
3981	AFP_ENG_20081029.0443.LDC2009T13	The lowering of fuel costs however was not enough to significantly improve the latest results.
3982	AFP_ENG_20081029.0443.LDC2009T13	Other airlines have also reported difficulties.
3983	AFP_ENG_20081029.0443.LDC2009T13	Air France-KLM last week said it would struggle to meet its billion-euro earnings target and that it would trim its investment plans.
3984	AFP_ENG_20081029.0443.LDC2009T13	It unveiled a plan to cut costs by up to 1.2 billion euros over the next five years.
3985	AFP_ENG_20081029.0443.LDC2009T13	The future of ailing Italian carrier Alitalia also remained uncertain.
3986	AFP_ENG_20081029.0443.LDC2009T13	British Airways earlier this month reiterated the company's interest in a partnership with Alitalia.
3987	AFP_ENG_20081029.0443.LDC2009T13	The airline, which is 49.9 percent state-owned, is losing about three million euros (4.3 million dollars) a day and has debts totalling some 1.2 billion euros, which will have to be shouldered by the Italian taxpayer.
3988	AFP_ENG_20081029.0443.LDC2009T13	Non-European airlines were feeling the strain too, with carriers worldwide expected to lose around 5.2 billion dollars this year owing to sharply higher oil prices and declining demand, the industry association IATA said on October 17, with losses expected to continue next year.

4002	AFP_ENG_20081103.0042.LDC2009T13	Hollywood screen idol Keanu Reeves was acquitted Monday of charges of negligence for allegedly striking a photographer with his car and fleeing the scene.

4030	AFP_ENG_20081104.0399.LDC2009T13	"When we come to Washington... I believe we will see countries coming together to make their statements about what they can contribute," he told reporters in Dubai.
4031	AFP_ENG_20081104.0399.LDC2009T13	"There's been a positive response but it's not my job to announce funds, it's a matter for the IMF when they talk to the individual countries."
4032	AFP_ENG_20081104.0399.LDC2009T13	The G20, which includes both Britain and Saudi Arabia, is meeting in Washington on November 15 for crunch talks on the crisis and will also discuss reforming international institutions like the IMF.
4033	AFP_ENG_20081104.0399.LDC2009T13	Brown met Dubai's ruler, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashed al-Maktoum, who is also vice president and prime minister of the United Arab Emirates, on Tuesday.
4034	AFP_ENG_20081104.0399.LDC2009T13	Since he arrived in the Gulf on Saturday, Brown has met Saudi Arabia's King Abdullah -- who will attend the G20 meeting, Qatar's Prime Minister Sheikh Hamad bin Jassem bin Jabr al-Thani and Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan.
4035	AFP_ENG_20081104.0399.LDC2009T13	Lord Peter Mandelson, the British Business Secretary and former EU commissioner who is travelling with Brown, told BBC radio that Gulf states would give money to help out other nations.
4036	AFP_ENG_20081104.0399.LDC2009T13	"The Gulf is open to business but they're also signing up as keen partners to help the rest of the world to get through the international financial crisis," he said.
4037	AFP_ENG_20081104.0399.LDC2009T13	"Specifically, it means that they will contribute to the IMF fund... but they will also contibute as partners to the decision- making that we need to make to build up the institutions, the new practices.
4038	AFP_ENG_20081104.0399.LDC2009T13	Mandelson said Brown was "worth his weight in gold" in negotiations with international partners in securing fresh business worth over 500 million pounds (about 790 million US dollars/620 million euros) during the trip.
4039	AFP_ENG_20081104.0399.LDC2009T13	Brown, the former British finance minister whose struggling premiership has been boosted by his handling of the financial crisis, also wants China to give extra.
4040	AFP_ENG_20081104.0399.LDC2009T13	He says he supports an expanded role in the IMF for countries which contribute to an extended fund.
4041	AFP_ENG_20081104.0399.LDC2009T13	Experts say Gulf states perceive the IMF as being dominated by the United States and other leading industrialised nations in the G7.
4042	AFP_ENG_20081104.0399.LDC2009T13	Brown has also stressed the "central" role to be played in the crisis by the next US president as Americans went to the polls to choose between Democrat Barack Obama and Republican John McCain.
4043	AFP_ENG_20081104.0399.LDC2009T13	This role would include boosting the world economy, working "to defeat protectionism in favour of free trade" and moving towards Middle East peace.
4044	AFP_ENG_20081104.0399.LDC2009T13	Brown said on Tuesday he would work with whoever won the White House.
4045	AFP_ENG_20081104.0399.LDC2009T13	During his tour, Brown has also called for more stability in the oil market, despite opposition to calls for lower prices from the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, of which Saudi Arabia, Qatar and UAE are all members.
4046	AFP_ENG_20081104.0399.LDC2009T13	The Qatari premier said he wanted to cooperate with the international community on the financial crisis, while other nations visited by Brown have not spoken publicly about the outcome of the talks.
4047	AFP_ENG_20081104.0547.LDC2009T13	Golf: More events and more money for Asian Tour in 2009
4048	AFP_ENG_20081104.0547.LDC2009T13	The Asian Tour will feature a record number of events in 2009 with more prize money offered than ever before as the game continues to grow in stature.
4049	AFP_ENG_20081104.0547.LDC2009T13	Executive Chairman Kyi Hla Han said Tuesday that three tournaments will make their debuts next year, including two new events in Thailand and an historic maiden tournament in Europe -- the Omega European Masters in Switzerland.
4050	AFP_ENG_20081104.0547.LDC2009T13	In addition, two other tournaments, including the Thailand Open, return to the calendar
4051	AFP_ENG_20081104.0547.LDC2009T13	The cash-rich Barclays Singapore Open, HSBC Champions and UBS Hong Kong Open, which offer a combined 12.5 million US dollars, once again bolster the back-end of the year prior to the season- ending Volvo Masters of Asia.
4052	AFP_ENG_20081104.0547.LDC2009T13	Han unveiled a 28-event schedule, including nine events co- sanctioned with the European Tour, adding that he was finalising five other tournaments which would be announced in due course.
4053	AFP_ENG_20081104.0547.LDC2009T13	Once concluded, the Asian Tour should hit an unprecedented 33 tournaments, surpassing this season's high of 30 when 39 million dollars were up for grabs.
4054	AFP_ENG_20081104.0547.LDC2009T13	"From a broad view, the 2009 Asian Tour schedule will represent the finest collection of the best tournaments across Asia, spanning from India all the way to Australia," said Han.
4055	AFP_ENG_20081104.0547.LDC2009T13	"We are also looking forward to the Omega European Masters in Switzerland which will be a ground-breaking event as it will be the first European event to be co- sanctioned by the Asian Tour."
4056	AFP_ENG_20081104.0547.LDC2009T13	The boost to regional golf comes despite the global financial downturn, with sponsors continuing to pump money into the game, which Han said reflected the Asian Tour's growth.
4057	AFP_ENG_20081104.0547.LDC2009T13	"We fully appreciate corporate Asia's continuous support towards professional golf during these challenging times," he said.
4058	AFP_ENG_20081104.0547.LDC2009T13	"It has reinforced the confidence and belief that the framework within the Asian Tour is solid and vibrant as our schedule has grown with each passing year since our inauguration as a players' organisation in 2004."
4059	AFP_ENG_20081104.0547.LDC2009T13	From an initial 22 events with 12 million dollars in prize money four years ago, the Asian Tour has grown by leaps and bounds.
4060	AFP_ENG_20081104.0547.LDC2009T13	The new season will kick off in January with the Royal Trophy, which pits Asia against Europe in a Ryder Cup-style shoot-out in Bangkok.
4061	AFP_ENG_20081104.0547.LDC2009T13	Thailand will stage four tournaments in 2009, including the Thailand Open, last played in 2005, and the Black Mountain Masters which will make its debut in March.
4062	AFP_ENG_20081104.0547.LDC2009T13	India hosts the Emaar-MGF Indian Masters, SAIL Open and Hero Honda Indian Open as golf there grows in popularity, while Malaysia also stages three events, including the Johor Open which doubles its prize fund to one million dollars.

4096	AFP_ENG_20081104.0689.LDC2009T13	India's first unmanned moon mission entered lunar space early Tuesday as part of its final journey this week into the moon's orbit, a top space official said.
4097	AFP_ENG_20081104.0689.LDC2009T13	The Chandrayaan-1 spacecraft was launched with an Indian-built rocket on October 22 from the country's southeastern coast.
4098	AFP_ENG_20081104.0689.LDC2009T13	"The operation to put Chandrayaan into lunar space went off very well," S. Satish, director of the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) told AFP.
4099	AFP_ENG_20081104.0689.LDC2009T13	The spacecraft is now 1,000 kilometres (600 miles) from the moon, enabling its terrain-mapping camera to shoot pictures of it.
4100	AFP_ENG_20081104.0689.LDC2009T13	Scientists are preparing for the next major stage to enable the spacecraft to enter lunar orbit on Saturday and position itself about 100 kilometres from the moon's surface.
4101	AFP_ENG_20081104.0689.LDC2009T13	Once the mission is in the lunar orbit, it will stabilise in about a week, after which it will send a probe instrument to the moon's surface.
4102	AFP_ENG_20081104.0689.LDC2009T13	Chandrayaan carries 11 payloads -- five from India and others from abroad.
4103	AFP_ENG_20081104.0689.LDC2009T13	During a two-year orbital mission, it will provide a detailed map of the mineral, chemical and topographical characteristics of the moon's surface.
4104	AFP_ENG_20081104.0689.LDC2009T13	The mission will cost India 80 million dollars.

4106	AFP_ENG_20081105.1056.LDC2009T13	Republican John McCain won in Georgia on Tuesday where polls had shown Democrat Barack Obama closing in on the deep Southern, conservative state, two TV networks said.
4107	AFP_ENG_20081105.1056.LDC2009T13	MSNBC and Fox News both projected that McCain had won the state and its 15 electoral votes.
4108	AFP_ENG_20081106.0034.LDC2009T13	Struggling US automakers ask Washington for more help
4109	AFP_ENG_20081106.0034.LDC2009T13	Leaders of the struggling US auto industry were in Washington Thursday asking for even more help from the government as they battle to staunch the hemorrhaging of their balance sheets.
4110	AFP_ENG_20081106.0034.LDC2009T13	Congress recently authorized 25 billion dollars in loan guarantees to help US automakers develop more fuel efficient vehicles in order to meet upcoming regulations.
4111	AFP_ENG_20081106.0034.LDC2009T13	Ford, GM and Chrysler are now asking for another massive infusion of low-cost loans, but this time without any strings attached.
4112	AFP_ENG_20081106.0034.LDC2009T13	"It is essential that we preserve our manufacturing and technology base in this country," said Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi in a statement.
4113	AFP_ENG_20081106.0034.LDC2009T13	"Today, the Democratic leadership discussed how to protect hundreds of thousands of workers and retirees, safeguard the interests of American taxpayers, and use cutting-edge technology to transform blue-collar jobs to green-collar jobs for generations to come."
4114	AFP_ENG_20081106.0034.LDC2009T13	She had told the Wall Street Journal Thursday she was open to providing additional assistance to the automakers as soon as next month, but insisted said the assistance should be tied to improving the competitiveness of the Detroit Three.
4115	AFP_ENG_20081106.0034.LDC2009T13	"I don't think you'll see much interest" in helping the industry, if aid goes toward "doing things the old way," Pelosi said.
4116	AFP_ENG_20081106.0034.LDC2009T13	Executives from General Motors, Ford Motor and Chrysler as well as the president of the United Auto Workers union also asked Pelosi to speed up the delivery of the loan guarantees during the meeting Thursday.
4117	AFP_ENG_20081106.0034.LDC2009T13	To press the case, the automakers planned to go over all the actions they've taken in the last two years to speed up the development of cleaner and more efficient vehicles," GM spokesman Greg Martin said.
4118	AFP_ENG_20081106.0034.LDC2009T13	"Right now, it all comes to a stop if they can't get help for the industry to get through this period," Martin told AFP.
4119	AFP_ENG_20081106.0034.LDC2009T13	The meeting came a day before GM and Ford were set to report significant third quarter losses and days after US auto sales sank to their lowest levels in 25 years.
4120	AFP_ENG_20081106.0034.LDC2009T13	The Detroit Three have already undertaken several massive restructuring programs in response to a steady loss of market share to Asian competitors.
4121	AFP_ENG_20081106.0034.LDC2009T13	That loss accelerated in recent years as high fuel prices shifted demand away from the gasoline-guzzling trucks and sport utility vehicles which had propped up their profits.
4122	AFP_ENG_20081106.0034.LDC2009T13	Then the credit crunch hit and auto sales plummeted as even consumers with good credit found it hard to get loans, as did the automakers whose credit ratings have fallen deeply into junk status amid bankruptcy fears.
4123	AFP_ENG_20081106.0034.LDC2009T13	General Motors has lost nearly 70 billion dollars from 2005 through the first half of this year while Ford's losses since 2006 topped 24 billion over the same period.
4124	AFP_ENG_20081106.0034.LDC2009T13	Chrysler is privately owned but like Ford and GM has been losing billions and laying off large chunks of its workforce.
4125	AFP_ENG_20081106.0034.LDC2009T13	The current cash burn poses a real threat to the survival of the automakers, said Dave Cole, chairman of the Center For Automotive Research.
4126	AFP_ENG_20081106.0034.LDC2009T13	"The likelihood of one or two of the Detroit Three manufacturers ending operations is very real," Cole said.
4127	AFP_ENG_20081106.0034.LDC2009T13	"To permit any of the Detroit Three manufacturers to collapse would scar the US economy further at a time when it can ill afford another blow."
4128	AFP_ENG_20081106.0034.LDC2009T13	Cole said a bailout would cost the government less than what it would spend on paying the unemployment benefits of the tens of thousands of workers who could lose their jobs.
4129	AFP_ENG_20081106.0034.LDC2009T13	"As policymakers consider their positions on assistance to the auto industry, they must decide, is an ounce of prevention indeed worth a pound of cure," Cole said.
4130	AFP_ENG_20081106.0034.LDC2009T13	But it's still unclear how much help the automakers will get and what form it will take, said Laurie Felax-Harbour of the Harbour- Felax Group.
4131	AFP_ENG_20081106.0034.LDC2009T13	"I expect they will do something," she said.
4132	AFP_ENG_20081106.0034.LDC2009T13	"But everybody is wondering what the plan is going to be," she said.
4133	AFP_ENG_20081106.0034.LDC2009T13	It is likely that any bailout would kill a potential merger of GM and Chrysler, she said.
4134	AFP_ENG_20081106.0034.LDC2009T13	Both the UAW and the senior senator from Michigan have openly opposed the merger which could result in the loss of an estimated 30,000 to 35,000 jobs at Chrysler and an untold number at General Motors.
4135	AFP_ENG_20081108.0457.LDC2009T13	Britain revokes visa of ousted Thai PM Thaksin: airline official
4136	AFP_ENG_20081108.0457.LDC2009T13	British authorities have revoked the visas of ousted Thai prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra and his wife Pojaman, an airline official told AFP Saturday.
4137	AFP_ENG_20081108.0457.LDC2009T13	The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the British embassy had informed all airlines in an email on Friday not to allow the couple to board flights to Britain.
4138	AFP_ENG_20081108.0457.LDC2009T13	"The British embassy sent an email message to all airlines.... It's general practice for all airlines, so no airline can take them on board to England from any port," he said.
4139	AFP_ENG_20081108.0457.LDC2009T13	Embassy officials refused to confirm or deny the report, but in the email seen by AFP, Bangkok-based immigration liaison manager Andy Gray, from the UK Border Agency wrote:
4140	AFP_ENG_20081108.0457.LDC2009T13	"The United Kingdom Border Agency has revoked the UK visas held by the following Thai nationals: Thaksin Shinawatra, Thai Passport Number D215863
4141	AFP_ENG_20081108.0457.LDC2009T13	Potjaman Shinawatra, Thai Passport Number D206635.
4142	AFP_ENG_20081108.0457.LDC2009T13	"The UK visas contained in the passports of the individuals listed above are no longer valid for travel.
4143	AFP_ENG_20081108.0457.LDC2009T13	Airlines are advised not to carry these passengers to the UK."
4144	AFP_ENG_20081108.0457.LDC2009T13	Thaksin, ousted in a 2006 coup, fled to Britain in early August and has since been sentenced in absentia to two years in prison for corruption.
4145	AFP_ENG_20081108.0457.LDC2009T13	His exact whereabouts on Saturday were unknown, but local media reported he was travelling from China to the Philippines.
4146	AFP_ENG_20081108.0457.LDC2009T13	Thaksin's Thailand-based spokesman said he could not confirm the report.
4147	AFP_ENG_20081108.0457.LDC2009T13	"What I can verify is that Thaksin has not received any document from the British authorities concerning this issue.... But if it's true Thaksin can clarify the matter," said Phonthep Thepkanjana.
4148	AFP_ENG_20081114.0035.LDC2009T13	Dollar, yen gain on fresh flight to safety
4149	AFP_ENG_20081114.0035.LDC2009T13	The dollar and yen attracted buyers Friday as investors looked for safety amid news that the eurozone fell into recession and world leaders met for a summit in Washington on the global financial crisis.
4150	AFP_ENG_20081114.0035.LDC2009T13	At 2200 GMT, the euro fell to 1.2591 dollars from 1.2779 dollars late in New York on Thursday.
4151	AFP_ENG_20081114.0035.LDC2009T13	The dollar dropped slightly to 97.06 yen from 97.67 yen on Thursday.
4152	AFP_ENG_20081114.0035.LDC2009T13	The pound remained sharply lower meanwhile at 1.4733 dollars from 1.482, after hitting a six-year low of 1.4557 earlier in the week.
4153	AFP_ENG_20081114.0035.LDC2009T13	The market digested news that the eurozone was in recession, and data showing a steep fall in US retail sales, the main driver of economic activity.
4154	AFP_ENG_20081114.0035.LDC2009T13	The Commerce Department said US retail sales tumbled a record 2.8 percent in October as consumers hunkered down in the face of a sharply slowing economy.
4155	AFP_ENG_20081114.0035.LDC2009T13	The retail report "wasn't fundamentally bullish for US assets, but instead, the disappointing nature of the news triggered flight to quality," said Terri Belkas at Forex Capital Management.
4156	AFP_ENG_20081114.0035.LDC2009T13	The dollar and yen have been the main beneficiaries of the financial turmoil on the assumption that the US and Japanese economies are best prepared to weather the global economic storm, but some of the moves are hard to explain.

4158	AFP_ENG_20081114.0035.LDC2009T13	The biggest winner in this reconfiguration has been the yen followed by the dollar.
4159	AFP_ENG_20081114.0035.LDC2009T13	Commodity-sensitive currencies and sterling are the main losers."
4160	AFP_ENG_20081114.0035.LDC2009T13	The market saw news that the economy of the 15 nations sharing the euro has slumped into recession for the first time, with gross domestic product (GDP) falling 0.2 percent in the second and third quarters.
4161	AFP_ENG_20081114.0035.LDC2009T13	Analysts said this would likely lead to rate cuts by the European Central Bank.
4162	AFP_ENG_20081114.0035.LDC2009T13	Traditionally, lower interest rates make a currency less attractive to investors even though they can help to boost economic growth.

4170	AFP_ENG_20081116.0074.LDC2009T13	Lippi kept faith with a relatively young squad so D'Agostino's club team-mate Simone Pepe and Villarreal forward Giuseppe Rossi both kept their places.
4171	AFP_ENG_20081116.0074.LDC2009T13	But despite the likes of Andrea Pirlo, Gianluigi Buffon, Antonio Di Natale and Alberto Aquilani there was still no place for either Alessandro Del Piero or Antonio Cassano.
4172	AFP_ENG_20081116.0074.LDC2009T13	Del Piero's omission was no surprise as Lippi had said earlier in the month that he would use the match to have a look at some new blood.

4183	AFP_ENG_20081118.0095.LDC2009T13	Chelsea defender John Terry said Tuesday he refuses to believe any of England's injured stars would willingly spurn the chance to play for their country - especially against Germany.
4184	AFP_ENG_20081118.0095.LDC2009T13	The traditional rivals line-up against each other at Berlin's Olympic Stadium on Wednesday with England shorn of many of their top names, but Terry has shaken off a foot injury to declare himself fit to face Germany.
4185	AFP_ENG_20081118.0095.LDC2009T13	Terry, 27, came through Monday's training session unscathed, but will line-up in an England side minus stars Wayne Rooney, Rio Ferdinand, Ashley Cole, Frank Lampard and Steven Gerrard who have all withdrawn injured.
4186	AFP_ENG_20081118.0095.LDC2009T13	Doubts emerged whether Gerrard was genuinely injured after he played a full 90 minutes at the weekend, but the Liverpool star later saw an England doctor who confirmed an adductor injury.
4187	AFP_ENG_20081118.0095.LDC2009T13	And England captain Terry says he fails to believe any player would willingly turn down the chance to play for their country.
4188	AFP_ENG_20081118.0095.LDC2009T13	"It is disappointing that people could think that is an option, because playing for your country is the ultimate," said Terry at Berlin's Olympic Stadium.
4189	AFP_ENG_20081118.0095.LDC2009T13	"Seeing the disappointment on the face of Frank Lampard, for example, he picked up an injury but gave it his best shot to be fit.

4191	AFP_ENG_20081118.0095.LDC2009T13	But England boss Fabio Capello says he will insist injured players are checked by national team doctors - not just their club doctors - in the future before they are declared unfit for internationals.
4192	AFP_ENG_20081118.0095.LDC2009T13	"We decided to check all the players to see if it's possible to recover the players or not," said Capello.
4193	AFP_ENG_20081118.0095.LDC2009T13	"But we have to check their physical condition every time.
4194	AFP_ENG_20081118.0095.LDC2009T13	We respect the club doctors, but it's right to check."
4195	AFP_ENG_20081118.0095.LDC2009T13	And Italian Capello insisted there is no club versus country row brewing between himself and England's Premier League managers as he understands the situation from both sides having coached European giants AC Milan, Juventus and Real Madrid.

4285	AFP_ENG_20081128.0657.LDC2009T13	Japan's recession woes deepen as output tumbles
4286	AFP_ENG_20081128.0657.LDC2009T13	Japan sank deeper into recession in October as factory output slumped and consumers reduced their spending in response to the economic crisis, a raft of grim data showed Friday.
4287	AFP_ENG_20081128.0657.LDC2009T13	Analysts said Asia's largest economy appears to be deteriorating more quickly than expected, dragged down by plunging exports.
4288	AFP_ENG_20081128.0657.LDC2009T13	Japanese industrial production tumbled 3.1 percent from the previous month as manufacturers slowed their factory lines to cope with the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression, the government said.
4289	AFP_ENG_20081128.0657.LDC2009T13	Manufacturers said they expected output to tumble 6.4 percent in November and a further 2.9 percent in December.
4290	AFP_ENG_20081128.0657.LDC2009T13	The figures were simply "horrendous", said Macquarie Securities economist Richard Jerram.
4291	AFP_ENG_20081128.0657.LDC2009T13	Analysts said production now looks likely to plunge 8.6 percent in the fourth quarter of this year, which would be the biggest drop on record.
4292	AFP_ENG_20081128.0657.LDC2009T13	Societe Generale chief Asia economist Glenn Maguire described the figures as "stunningly bad."
4293	AFP_ENG_20081128.0657.LDC2009T13	"Japan's industrial activity is set to worsen in the near-term, perhaps by an unprecedented degree, as exports to the US have plunged over the past year," he warned.
4294	AFP_ENG_20081128.0657.LDC2009T13	Adding to the gloom, consumer spending dropped 3.8 percent in October from a year earlier as Japanese households tightened their purse strings following months of grim news on the economy and plunging stock market.
4295	AFP_ENG_20081128.0657.LDC2009T13	"Japan is beginning to be substantially affected by the global economic recession," said Kaoru Yosano, the economic and fiscal policy minister.
4296	AFP_ENG_20081128.0657.LDC2009T13	"We are unable to be optimistic (about Japan's economy) from now until next year."
4297	AFP_ENG_20081128.0657.LDC2009T13	Morgan Stanley analysts said Japan's economy could contract by more than 3.0 percent in the final quarter of 2008 on an annualised basis, after shrinking 0.4 percent in the third quarter.
4298	AFP_ENG_20081128.0657.LDC2009T13	Japanese exports fell at the fastest pace in almost seven years in October, tumbling 7.7 percent from a year earlier, as once- buoyant shipments to the rest of Asia started to drop, earlier figures showed.
4299	AFP_ENG_20081128.0657.LDC2009T13	Although unemployment dropped to 3.7 percent in October from 4.0 percent in September, analysts said that was mainly the result of a shrinking labour force in the greying nation.
4300	AFP_ENG_20081128.0657.LDC2009T13	The figures also do not include temporary workers, who have been first in the firing line with thousands of positions axed in recent weeks at carmakers and other manufacturers.
4301	AFP_ENG_20081128.0657.LDC2009T13	There were only 80 job opportunities for every 100 job seekers in October, suggesting that it is becoming more challenging to find work.
4302	AFP_ENG_20081128.0657.LDC2009T13	"Domestic demand remains weak, and a drop in unemployment seems to be temporary," said Yasuo Yamamoto, senior economist at Mizuho Research Institute.
4303	AFP_ENG_20081128.0657.LDC2009T13	Core inflation slowed to 1.9 percent in October as oil prices fell and a stronger yen reduced the cost of imports, adding to concerns that Japan may slip back into deflation.
4304	AFP_ENG_20081128.0657.LDC2009T13	Last month Japan's central bank cut interest rates for the first time in seven years to try to ward off a deep recession, lowering its key lending rate by 20 basis points to just 0.3 percent.
4305	AFP_ENG_20081128.0657.LDC2009T13	Some analysts expect a return to virtually free credit in Japan.
4306	AFP_ENG_20081128.0657.LDC2009T13	"I think the BoJ will be forced to cut rates by the end of this year," said Yamamoto.
4307	AFP_ENG_20081128.0657.LDC2009T13	The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development predicted this week that Japan would sink back into deflation in the second half of next year, requiring its interest rates to be kept very low, possibly beyond 2010.

4310	AFP_ENG_20081129.0458.LDC2009T13	"We shot dead two terrorists early this morning at the Taj Hotel," Hassan Gafoor said, adding it was still unclear how many more gunmen were still holed up inside the hotel.

4313	AFP_ENG_20081202.0439.LDC2009T13	Musicians at Milan's La Scala opera house called off a strike that would have disrupted the season's opening performances after reaching an agreement with management on their pay, an official said Tuesday.
4314	AFP_ENG_20081202.0439.LDC2009T13	"An agreement was found yesterday (Monday) evening," a spokeswoman told AFP, adding that three performances of Verdi's "Don Carlo" were "therefore confirmed."
4315	AFP_ENG_20081202.0439.LDC2009T13	The season is due to open, as tradition dictates, on Sunday, which is Saint Ambroses's Day honouring Milan's patron saint.
4316	AFP_ENG_20081202.0439.LDC2009T13	The threat strike was made by Fials, the trade union representing most of the theatre's musicians and other employees, including musicians, who objected to an agreement signed by La Scala management and three other unions in July.
4317	AFP_ENG_20081202.0439.LDC2009T13	The protesting employees had said a benefits and wages package for 2008 to 2011 worth 11.5 million euros (14.8 million dollars) was not enough.
4318	AFP_ENG_20081202.0439.LDC2009T13	Fials signed on to the agreement after several modifications, the opera house's spokeswoman said.
4319	AFP_ENG_20081202.0439.LDC2009T13	The union had wanted employees to go on strike during the first three shows of the season, including Sunday's gala opener, a 42 -year-old tradition.

4322	AFP_ENG_20081203.0425.LDC2009T13	But they said the improved political climate could be short-lived with the Thai parliament early next month expected to vote for a new leader from the existing ruling coalition of parties.

4328	AFP_ENG_20081203.0425.LDC2009T13	"The same coalition will stick together and try to form a new government," said Kosin Sripaiboon, an analyst at UOB Kay Hian Securities.
4329	AFP_ENG_20081203.0425.LDC2009T13	Kosin said investors would adopt a wait-and-see approach until the political situation becomes clearer.
4330	AFP_ENG_20081203.0425.LDC2009T13	He said the Bank of Thailand had made its steepest cut in interest rates yet, by 100 basis points, but it had failed to boost sentiment among cash-poor commercial banks.

4337	AFP_ENG_20081204.0661.LDC2009T13	Officials also said three cars and jewellery had disappeared from Government House during the occupation by the People's Alliance for Democracy, although one anonymous donor paid off a big water bill.
4338	AFP_ENG_20081204.0661.LDC2009T13	PAD demonstrators took over the complex in late August and vacated it on Monday to reinforce a blockade of Bangkok's airports.
4339	AFP_ENG_20081204.0661.LDC2009T13	They ended all protests after a court ousted Prime Minister Somchai Wongsawat on Tuesday.
4340	AFP_ENG_20081204.0661.LDC2009T13	"Police found a number of molotov cocktails, homemade bombs, clubs and machetes around Government House this morning," Major General Anan Srihiran, of Bangkok Metropolitan police, said.
4341	AFP_ENG_20081204.0661.LDC2009T13	"There are more than 100 items, we will keep them as evidence," he said.
4342	AFP_ENG_20081204.0661.LDC2009T13	The protesters had caused 25 million baht (715,000 dollars) of damage and run up an electricity bill of 900,000 baht during their time there, said Nathi Premrasmi, permanent secretary for Government House.
4343	AFP_ENG_20081204.0661.LDC2009T13	"Three cars have also disappeared and more than 10 cars belonging to the National Security Council have been damaged... jewellery has been taken," Nathi said.

4345	AFP_ENG_20081204.0661.LDC2009T13	Government officials were not being allowed inside the building until special branch police had cleared all the weaponry.
4346	AFP_ENG_20081204.0661.LDC2009T13	About 17,000 protesters filled the Government House complex at the peak of the demonstration, accusing the government of corruption and acting on behalf of ousted premier Thaksin Shinawatra, and demanding it step down.
4347	AFP_ENG_20081204.0661.LDC2009T13	Protesters had been camped out for more than three months, filling the ornate lawns and surrounding the main Venetian-style building, built in 1908 to welcome kings and visiting dignitaries.

4352	AFP_ENG_20081205.0472.LDC2009T13	Paris got a brand new temple to film Friday when the Forum des Images reopened after three years of renovations and kicked off a packed programme with a three- month cinematic homage to New York City.
4353	AFP_ENG_20081205.0472.LDC2009T13	The Forum, best known as the movie centre that launched the world's first annual film festival for movies made on or for mobile phones, sits deep in the bowels of the historic centre of Paris known as Les Halles.
4354	AFP_ENG_20081205.0472.LDC2009T13	The street it lies on, one of the maze of alleys that form a giant subterranean shopping mall, was this week officially renamed Cinema Street.
4355	AFP_ENG_20081205.0472.LDC2009T13	It hosts the giant UGC multiplex, which claims to be Europe's busiest cinema, and the brand-new Francois Truffaut film library named after the French New Wave director.
4356	AFP_ENG_20081205.0472.LDC2009T13	The Forum des Images, redesigned by architect Anouk Legendre to give it the futuristic feel of a trendy bar or nightclub, claims to be unique on two counts.
4357	AFP_ENG_20081205.0472.LDC2009T13	"This is the first time that a city has said to itself that its memory does not only exist in books but also in images," its director Laurence Herszberg told AFP.
4358	AFP_ENG_20081205.0472.LDC2009T13	"No city in the world and no capital in the world has like Paris built up a collection of thousands of films, exclusively films where the action takes place in Paris, which talk about Paris, which evoke Paris," she said.
4359	AFP_ENG_20081205.0472.LDC2009T13	There are documentaries, fiction films, television ads and archive images among the collection of 5,500 films, which the Forum has transferred to digital format at a cost of five million euros (6.4 million dollars).
4360	AFP_ENG_20081205.0472.LDC2009T13	The Forum's other claim to innovation is the way visitors can view films they select from the extensive archives.
4361	AFP_ENG_20081205.0472.LDC2009T13	There are five standard screens catering for audiences of 30 to 450 people, in which themed festival programmes and other events will be held, but the centre's unique selling point is its trendy viewing "lounge," said Herszberg.
4362	AFP_ENG_20081205.0472.LDC2009T13	"Usually in video libraries everything is centred on individual consultation, each person is in a little box with a little screen to watch the film.
4363	AFP_ENG_20081205.0472.LDC2009T13	But here we think that that this should be an act of cinema," she said.
4364	AFP_ENG_20081205.0472.LDC2009T13	In the dimly lit lounge, the black walls and roof are offset by red and pink sofas on each of which two head-phone wearing people can sit together and watch a movie on a small screen.
4365	AFP_ENG_20081205.0472.LDC2009T13	Lining the walls are a handful of alcoves with individual viewing stations.
4366	AFP_ENG_20081205.0472.LDC2009T13	There are also two sections cordoned off by glass walls where up to seven people can book the space for a modest fee to together watch a film of their choice.
4367	AFP_ENG_20081205.0472.LDC2009T13	In total the lounge can cater for 80 people at a time, with a space where teachers can take their classes for lessons in cinema.
4368	AFP_ENG_20081205.0472.LDC2009T13	Education is another focus of the new Forum, which before it closed for renovation was getting 300,000 visitors a year.
4369	AFP_ENG_20081205.0472.LDC2009T13	Cinema master classes are now to be delivered every month by a major figure from the world of celluloid.
4370	AFP_ENG_20081205.0472.LDC2009T13	James Gray, the US director of "Little Odessa," "We Own The Night," and most recently "Two Lovers," will be the first to deliver a master class at the Forum later this month.
4371	AFP_ENG_20081205.0472.LDC2009T13	His intervention is also part of the first themed film festival to be presented at the revamped Forum.
4372	AFP_ENG_20081205.0472.LDC2009T13	One hundred and fifty films will pay homage to the world's most filmed city, New York, in a series that will continue until next March.
4373	AFP_ENG_20081205.0472.LDC2009T13	The following cycle of films will be on the theme of desire, followed by a couple of months of movies that focus on vengeance.
4374	AFP_ENG_20081205.0472.LDC2009T13	Rushed Parisians will also be able to whisk into the Forum during their lunch break for a half-hour burst of cinema in the form of short films, after which they can lunch on Mediterranean cuisine in its very trendy cafe-restaurant.

4400	AFP_ENG_20081217.0600.LDC2009T13	British Airways said on Wednesday it was cutting fuel surcharges on long-haul plane tickets by as much as a third because of tumbling oil prices which slash the cost of jet fuel.

4406	AFP_ENG_20081219.0160.LDC2009T13	The acquittal of Rwanda's ex-army colonel Theoneste Bagosora by the UN war crimes tribunal of conspiracy to commit genocide marks the court's failure to prove the massacre was planned, analysts said Friday.
4407	AFP_ENG_20081219.0160.LDC2009T13	Bagosora, jailed for life by the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) Thursday, had been accused by prosecutors of being the "brains" behind the 1994 genocide when some 800,000 people were killed in a 100-day spree.
4408	AFP_ENG_20081219.0160.LDC2009T13	The former Rwandan defence ministry chief of staff was sentenced alongside two co-defendants of "genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes," but acquitted of conspiring to commit genocide before April 7, 1994.
4409	AFP_ENG_20081219.0160.LDC2009T13	Nonetheless, the court upheld that Bagosora, 67, was the Rwanda's de facto army chief after the April 6, 1994 downing of a plane carrying then president Juvenal Habyarimana, an act believed to have triggered the genocide.
4410	AFP_ENG_20081219.0160.LDC2009T13	To date no suspect has ever been convicted by the Tanzania-based ICTR on conspiracy accusation despite charging nearly all the suspects with the crime.
4411	AFP_ENG_20081219.0160.LDC2009T13	"This means that nobody organised the genocide, that it would be a crime without a perpetrator and without premeditation," said Filip Reyntjens, a lecturer at Belgium's Anvers university and an expert prosecution witness in Bagosora's case.
4412	AFP_ENG_20081219.0160.LDC2009T13	"Thus the genocide was spontaneous.
4413	AFP_ENG_20081219.0160.LDC2009T13	This is very worrying," Reyntjens told AFP.
4414	AFP_ENG_20081219.0160.LDC2009T13	For Andre Guichaoua, also an expert ICTR witness, "to dare say with humility that there is no sufficient evidence in Bagosora's case to prove conspiracy is a ruling with huge consequences, moreso politically."
4415	AFP_ENG_20081219.0160.LDC2009T13	However, the court ruled that some of the accused had a role in the formation of militia, distribution of arms and compiling lists of those suspected to be close to then Tutsi-led Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) rebels or those opposed to the government of the day.
4416	AFP_ENG_20081219.0160.LDC2009T13	But it did not establish whether the activities were aimed at killing Tusti civilians with the aim of committing genocide, according to court documents.
4417	AFP_ENG_20081219.0160.LDC2009T13	ICTR chief prosecutor Hassan Bubacar Jallow charged that Bagosora and three other ex-army officers, one of whom was cleared of all charges, were involved in a conspiracy that began in late 1990 when hundreds of Tutsis were arrested after an attack by the RPF.
4418	AFP_ENG_20081219.0160.LDC2009T13	The conspiracy became more explicit the following year when the accused, part of a 10-member panel formed by Habyarimana, worked towards the "definition of the enemy", Jallow argued.
4419	AFP_ENG_20081219.0160.LDC2009T13	The panel met to explore ways of "defeating the enemy militarily, politically and through the media," with the enemy being the Tutsis.
4420	AFP_ENG_20081219.0160.LDC2009T13	"ICTR's failure is not wholesome.
4421	AFP_ENG_20081219.0160.LDC2009T13	A senior figure was tried and convicted on Thursday.
4422	AFP_ENG_20081219.0160.LDC2009T13	But even then, despite all the resources at its desposal, the ICTR has not decoded the planning of the genocide.
4423	AFP_ENG_20081219.0160.LDC2009T13	This is sad," Reyntjens said.
4424	AFP_ENG_20081219.0160.LDC2009T13	There is a "lack of will by the tribunal ... which did not accomplish its task to the end," said Guichaoua.
4425	AFP_ENG_20081219.0160.LDC2009T13	"To me Bagosora was delegated to, he was not in control," Guichaoua explained.
4426	AFP_ENG_20081219.0160.LDC2009T13	"This means that the ICTR does not want to go up to the top ... but not wanting to know who assassinated Juvenal Habyarimana or pursue the crimes of senior RPF leaders, the court is thus morally handicapped," he added.
4427	AFP_ENG_20081219.0160.LDC2009T13	The tribunal, formed in late 1994 to try masterminds of the massacre, has also been faulted for failing to pursue alleged genocide perpetrators within the RPF which took power in 1994.

4429	AFP_ENG_20081220.0276.LDC2009T13	Thailand was on Saturday awaiting the unveiling of new Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva's cabinet, which he says will bring national reconciliation but which has already stirred controversy.
4430	AFP_ENG_20081220.0276.LDC2009T13	Abhisit has vowed to bring stability to Thailand and boost an economy battered by six months of protests against the last government, which ended on December 3 after a court dissolved the ruling People Power Party (PPP).
4431	AFP_ENG_20081220.0276.LDC2009T13	Oxford-educated Abhisit was voted in by parliament on December 15 with the help of defecting MPs, but the Democrat Party leader's cabinet has already hit a snag with business leaders criticising some ministers as inexperienced.
4432	AFP_ENG_20081220.0276.LDC2009T13	Local media reported that the outcry prompted a last-minute change of industry minister before the list went to the revered king for royal approval late Friday.
4433	AFP_ENG_20081220.0276.LDC2009T13	"Every coalition party has sent their list of ministers, and the cabinet secretary has forwarded the list to the palace," Abhisit said Friday.
4434	AFP_ENG_20081220.0276.LDC2009T13	"I am willing to listen to all criticism, but as head of government I have to find a balance.
4435	AFP_ENG_20081220.0276.LDC2009T13	I have told ministers of that concern, so they must quickly work to create confidence and select acceptable working teams."
4436	AFP_ENG_20081220.0276.LDC2009T13	Since May, Thailand has been beset by increasingly disruptive protests by the People's Alliance for Democracy (PAD).
4437	AFP_ENG_20081220.0276.LDC2009T13	The PAD accused the now-defunct PPP of being disloyal to the monarchy and of running Thailand on behalf of ousted premier Thaksin Shinawatra, who lives in exile abroad to escape corruption charges.
4438	AFP_ENG_20081220.0276.LDC2009T13	PAD protests reached their peak at the end of November when thousands of their supporters occupied Bangkok's two main airports for about a week, stranding up to 350,000 passengers and causing massive economic damage.
4439	AFP_ENG_20081220.0276.LDC2009T13	The group only ended their siege after the PPP was dissolved over vote fraud charges related to elections they won one year ago, allowing the Democrats to win over former PPP lawmakers and small parties to form the government.
4440	AFP_ENG_20081220.0276.LDC2009T13	Abhisit has said he wants to bring peace and stability back to the kingdom after the protests and has tried to reach out to Thaksin's supporters, but some of his reported choices for cabinet posts have cast doubt on those promises.
4441	AFP_ENG_20081220.0276.LDC2009T13	Kasit Piromya, slated as the new foreign minister, was a vocal supporter of the PAD and took to the stage repeatedly during their six-month protest campaign to criticise the government.
4442	AFP_ENG_20081220.0276.LDC2009T13	The Democrat Party has already been accused of tacitly backing the PAD, while supporters of Thaksin have accused the courts and the army of staging a "silent coup" to get the establishment- friendly Democrats into power.

4454	AFP_ENG_20081228.0401.LDC2009T13	After a year when leading economies slid into recession, the forecasts paint an even grimmer picture for the 12 months ahead.
4455	AFP_ENG_20081228.0401.LDC2009T13	The slowdown in global demand will mean more job cuts, factory closures and bankruptcies, as well as budget-stretching rescue plans and government bailouts running into the hundreds of billions of dollars (euros), economists said.
4456	AFP_ENG_20081228.0401.LDC2009T13	"We see 2009 as really being a bad year, with recession for most advanced economies and growth decreasing for emerging economies," the head of the International Monetary Fund, Dominique Strauss- Kahn, said earlier this month.
4457	AFP_ENG_20081228.0401.LDC2009T13	The IMF's chief economist, Olivier Blanchard, urged world governments to spend more in order to boost domestic demand "if we want to prevent this recession developing into a Great Depression" like the downturn of the 1930s.
4458	AFP_ENG_20081228.0401.LDC2009T13	In the past 12 months, the OPEC oil cartel has implemented record cuts in production amid plummeting demand, stock markets have plunged and the world financial and auto sectors have been reshaped by state intervention.

4490	APW_ENG_20020131.1110.LDC2007T07	PHILADELPHIA (AP)
4491	APW_ENG_20020131.1110.LDC2007T07	A tenured math professor who complained Temple University wanted him to inflate grades and ``dummy down'' course work has been fired on grounds of incompetence, his attorney said.
4492	APW_ENG_20020131.1110.LDC2007T07	Martin Eisen, 69, who worked at Temple for nearly 35 years, had been on paid leave since August 1999 while the university investigated students' complaints about his grading practices.
4493	APW_ENG_20020131.1110.LDC2007T07	Three separate faculty committees reviewed 1,200 pages of testimony before finding Eisen to be ``incompetent,'' Eisen's attorney, F. Michael Daily Jr., said Wednesday.
4494	APW_ENG_20020131.1110.LDC2007T07	``Our position is that he is not incompetent,'' Daily said.
4495	APW_ENG_20020131.1110.LDC2007T07	``What Temple demanded that Dr. Eisen do ... was dummy down the course so these kids would get college credit for a college-level course which was really a high school course.''
4496	APW_ENG_20020131.1110.LDC2007T07	University spokeswoman Harriet Goodheart refused to comment Wednesday, calling it a personnel matter.
4497	APW_ENG_20020131.1110.LDC2007T07	The firing of a tenured professor is a ``remarkably serious and difficult decision, and you have to look at this with great care.
4498	APW_ENG_20020131.1110.LDC2007T07	And I think that has happened,'' said economics professor Michael Goetz, president of the Faculty Senate.
4499	APW_ENG_20020131.1110.LDC2007T07	Daily claimed Eisen was fired because he refused to make the course work easier or give students grades they did not deserve.
4500	APW_ENG_20020131.1110.LDC2007T07	Eisen's students had a high failure rate and many of them complained, Daily said.
4501	APW_ENG_20020131.1110.LDC2007T07	Upset students have yelled obscenities at Eisen and physically blocked the doorway to his class, Daily said.
4502	APW_ENG_20020131.1110.LDC2007T07	Anticipating he would be fired, Eisen filed a federal civil rights lawsuit against Temple last summer.
4503	APW_ENG_20020131.1110.LDC2007T07	He seeks reinstatement to his job, back pay and other monetary damages.
4504	APW_ENG_20020131.1110.LDC2007T07	Temple has moved to get the lawsuit dismissed.
4505	APW_ENG_20020131.1110.LDC2007T07	Goetz maintained that classes at Temple have not been dumbed down.
4506	APW_ENG_20020131.1110.LDC2007T07	He said grade inflation does exist, but no more than at ``any other university in the United States.''
4507	APW_ENG_20020131.1110.LDC2007T07	Grade inflation recently became an issue at Harvard University when a university study found that nearly half of all grades awarded were A or A-minus, a sharp increase from a decade earlier.

4513	APW_ENG_20020411.0630.LDC2007T07	A leading human rights activist denied in court Thursday that she advocated a separate Kurdish state when she used the word ``Kurdistan'' during a speech at a women's rights conference.
4514	APW_ENG_20020411.0630.LDC2007T07	Eren Keskin, a lawyer and the head of the independent Human Rights Association, faces up to three years in prison if found guilty of charges of separatist propaganda for saying that ``women in Kurdistan face harassment and rape the most'' during a speech she gave in November 2001.
4515	APW_ENG_20020411.0630.LDC2007T07	Keskin, who defended herself in the opening hearing of her trial Thursday, said she had used the word ``Kurdistan'' to describe a geographic region and not to refer to a state separate from Turkey.
4516	APW_ENG_20020411.0630.LDC2007T07	``I advocate Turks and Kurds living together,'' she told the court.
4517	APW_ENG_20020411.0630.LDC2007T07	The court adjourned trial until July 4.
4518	APW_ENG_20020411.0630.LDC2007T07	As head of the human rights group, Keskin is frequently in court for breaching Turkish laws that curb freedom of speech.
4519	APW_ENG_20020411.0630.LDC2007T07	She has some 90 cases pending against her for criticizing Turkey's human rights record and treatment of its estimated 12 million Kurds.
4520	APW_ENG_20020411.0630.LDC2007T07	Turkey fought a 15-year war against Kurdish rebels demanding autonomy in the southeast and is sensitive toward the use of the word ``Kurdistan'' in describing Turkey's mainly Kurdish southeast region.
4521	APW_ENG_20020411.0630.LDC2007T07	Many see it as an expression advocating the country's breakup.
4522	APW_ENG_20020411.0630.LDC2007T07	The Kurdistan Workers' Party, or PKK, announced a unilateral cease- fire in 1999.
4523	APW_ENG_20020411.0630.LDC2007T07	The government rejected the cease-fire and sporadic fighting continues.
4524	APW_ENG_20020411.0630.LDC2007T07	About 37,000 people, mostly Kurdish rebels and civilians, have been killed in the fighting since 1984.
4525	APW_ENG_20020411.0630.LDC2007T07	Earlier this year, Turkey's parliament relaxed laws limiting freedom of expression to boost the country's bid to join the European Union but left laws dealing with separatism largely unchanged.

4527	APW_ENG_20020411.0630.LDC2007T07	The court overturned the conviction of Mehmet Kutlular after his lawyers argued that the case should be retried because of the changes to Turkey's freedom of speech laws.
4528	APW_ENG_20020411.0630.LDC2007T07	Kutlular served some nine months of a two-year sentence before he was released early at the request of his lawyers, pending the new hearing.

5000	APW_ENG_20070103.1074.LDC2009T13	BAGHDAD, Iraq -- An Iraqi official announced on Wednesday the arrest of a witness to Saddam Hussein's hanging who allegedly recorded the event on a cell phone camera, while an adviser to the prime minister said two guards present were in custody.
5001	APW_ENG_20070103.1074.LDC2009T13	A U.S. military spokesman, meanwhile, said the tumultuous execution would have gone differently had the Americans been in charge.
5002	APW_ENG_20070103.1074.LDC2009T13	Maj. Gen. William B. Caldwell also said that Saddam had been dignified and courteous to his American jailers to the moment when he was handed over to the Iraqis outside the execution chamber.
5003	APW_ENG_20070103.1074.LDC2009T13	The spokesman said no Americans were present for the hanging.
5004	APW_ENG_20070103.1074.LDC2009T13	The leaked and unauthorized cell phone video, in which some of those present can be heard to taunt Saddam in the final moments of his life, set off an uproar both inside and outside Iraq.
5005	APW_ENG_20070103.1074.LDC2009T13	The storm of criticism prompted the U.S. to publicly distance itself and Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki to launch the investigation that led to Wednesday's detentions.
5006	APW_ENG_20070103.1074.LDC2009T13	"In the past few hours, the government has arrested the person who videotaped Saddam's execution.
5007	APW_ENG_20070103.1074.LDC2009T13	He was an official who supervised the execution and now he is under investigation," said a key al-Maliki adviser, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to release the information.
5008	APW_ENG_20070103.1074.LDC2009T13	Sami al-Askeri, a Shiite lawmaker who also advises al-Maliki, said two "Justice Ministry guards were being questioned.
5009	APW_ENG_20070103.1074.LDC2009T13	The investigation committee is interrogating the men.
5010	APW_ENG_20070103.1074.LDC2009T13	If it is found that any official was involved he will face legal measures."
5011	APW_ENG_20070103.1074.LDC2009T13	Joining Caldwell in his criticism of the hanging, State Department spokesman Sean McCormack said U.S. officials had questioned conducting the execution on a Muslim festival day and as well as some procedures.
5012	APW_ENG_20070103.1074.LDC2009T13	U.S. Embassy spokesman Lou Fintor said Ambassador Zalmay Khalilzad and his diplomatic team "did engage the government of Iraq on issues relating to procedures involved in the timing of the execution (of Saddam), given the upcoming holy days.
5013	APW_ENG_20070103.1074.LDC2009T13	While the government of Iraq gave consideration to U.S. concerns, all decisions made regarding the execution were Iraqi decisions based on their own considerations."
5014	APW_ENG_20070103.1074.LDC2009T13	Also Wednesday, Iraqi and Arab media and a government official said preparations were under way to hang two of Saddam Hussein's co-defendants in the next few days, but the details still have to be worked out with the American military.
5015	APW_ENG_20070103.1074.LDC2009T13	A Cabinet official, speaking anonymously because of the sensitivity of the information, said the two men would hang "at the beginning of next week."
5016	APW_ENG_20070103.1074.LDC2009T13	Caldwell said those executions, like Saddam's, were the responsibility of the Iraqi government.
5017	APW_ENG_20070103.1074.LDC2009T13	"It's a sovereign nation.
5018	APW_ENG_20070103.1074.LDC2009T13	It's their system.
5019	APW_ENG_20070103.1074.LDC2009T13	They make those decisions."
5020	APW_ENG_20070103.1074.LDC2009T13	Saddam's half brother Barzan Ibrahim, a former intelligence chief, and Awad Hamed al-Bandar, the former chief justice of the Revolutionary Court, were originally scheduled to hang with Saddam.
5021	APW_ENG_20070103.1074.LDC2009T13	But their execution was delayed until after Islam's Eid al-Adha holiday, which ended Wednesday for Iraq's majority Shiites.
5022	APW_ENG_20070103.1074.LDC2009T13	In Washington, a lawyer for Bandar asked Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts to block the U.S. military from transferring custody of the condemned man to Iraqi authorities.
5023	APW_ENG_20070103.1074.LDC2009T13	U.S. courts have so far declined to intervene.
5024	APW_ENG_20070103.1074.LDC2009T13	U.N.'s human rights chief Louise Arbour appealed to Iraqi President Jalal Talabani to prevent the execution of Ibrahim and al-Bandar, saying she was concerned with "the fairness and impartiality" of their trials.
5025	APW_ENG_20070103.1074.LDC2009T13	As the hanging video swirled, Mowaffak al-Rubaie, the Iraqi national security adviser and a close ally of al-Maliki, hotly denied that he was involved in taking video of the execution.
5026	APW_ENG_20070103.1074.LDC2009T13	He spoke to CNN after the announcement of the arrest of the unnamed official in connection with the case.
5027	APW_ENG_20070103.1074.LDC2009T13	The New York Times reported Wednesday, citing a prosecutor in the Saddam trial present at the execution, that al-Rubaie had recorded the execution with a cell phone.
5028	APW_ENG_20070103.1074.LDC2009T13	Al-Rubaie said neither he nor any other Iraqi official had shot and leaked the video to Al-Jazeera television and Web sites.
5029	APW_ENG_20070103.1074.LDC2009T13	Instead, he suggested Sunni insurgents infiltrated the guard force and took the pictures.
5030	APW_ENG_20070103.1074.LDC2009T13	According to the Times, Munqith al-Faroon, the prosecutor, told the newspaper "one of two men he had seen holding a cell phone camera aloft to make a video of Mr. Hussein's last moments up to and past the point where he fell through the trapdoor was Mowaffak al-Rubaie, Mr. Maliki's national security adviser."
5031	APW_ENG_20070103.1074.LDC2009T13	But Al-Faroon, in an interview with The Associated Press, denied the report.
5032	APW_ENG_20070103.1074.LDC2009T13	"I am not accusing Mowaffak al-Rubaie, and I did not see him taking pictures," he said.
5033	APW_ENG_20070103.1074.LDC2009T13	"But I saw two of the government officials who were...present during the execution taking all the video of the execution, using the lights that were there for the official taping of the execution," he added in a phone interview.
5034	APW_ENG_20070103.1074.LDC2009T13	"They used mobile phone cameras.
5035	APW_ENG_20070103.1074.LDC2009T13	I do not know their names, but I would remember their faces."
5036	APW_ENG_20070103.1074.LDC2009T13	On its Web site, the Times later noted denials by al-Rubaie and al-Faroon.
5037	APW_ENG_20070103.1074.LDC2009T13	As the storm over the handling of the execution gained strength, Caldwell was among several U.S. officials who suggested displeasure with the conduct of the execution.
5038	APW_ENG_20070103.1074.LDC2009T13	"If you are asking me: 'Would we have done things differently?'
5039	APW_ENG_20070103.1074.LDC2009T13	Yes, we would have.
5040	APW_ENG_20070103.1074.LDC2009T13	But that's not our decision.
5041	APW_ENG_20070103.1074.LDC2009T13	That's the government of Iraq's decision," Caldwell said.
5042	APW_ENG_20070103.1074.LDC2009T13	Saddam, Ibrahim and al-Bandar were sentenced to death for the 1982 killings of 148 Shiite Muslims in the town of Dujail, north of Baghdad, after a failed assassination plot against Saddam.
5043	APW_ENG_20070103.1074.LDC2009T13	They were convicted on Nov. 5, and the verdict was upheld by an appeals court on Dec. 26.
5044	APW_ENG_20070103.1074.LDC2009T13	Saddam was hanged in Baghdad's Shiite neighborhood of Kazamiyah.
5045	APW_ENG_20070103.1074.LDC2009T13	During his regime, Saddam had numerous dissidents and opponents executed in the facility, located in a neighborhood that is home to the Iraqi capital's most important Shiite shrine -- the Imam Kazim shrine.
5046	APW_ENG_20070103.1074.LDC2009T13	As he faced his own death on the gallows, Caldwell said, Saddam "was courteous, as he always had been, to his U.S. military police guards."
5047	APW_ENG_20070103.1074.LDC2009T13	The spokesman said Saddam's demeanor changed "at the prison facility when the Iraqi guards were assuming control of him, but he was still dignified toward us.
5048	APW_ENG_20070103.1074.LDC2009T13	"He spoke very well to our military police, as he always had.
5049	APW_ENG_20070103.1074.LDC2009T13	And when getting off there at the prison site, he said farewell to his interpreter.
5050	APW_ENG_20070103.1074.LDC2009T13	"He thanked the military police squad, the lieutenant, the squad leader, the medical doctor we had present, and the colonel that was on site."

5053	APW_ENG_20070105.1026.LDC2009T13	Austria saw a roughly 41 percent decline in asylum applications in 2006, the government said Friday.
5054	APW_ENG_20070105.1026.LDC2009T13	Applications for asylum decreased from 22,461 in 2005 to 13,347 in 2006, a decline of 40.6 percent, the Austria Press Agency reported, citing figures provided by the Interior Ministry.
5055	APW_ENG_20070105.1026.LDC2009T13	A ministry spokeswoman confirmed the APA report and said that while no specific country-by-country breakdown was available as yet, the largest declines came from the Russian Federation and the former Serbia-Montenegro.
5056	APW_ENG_20070105.1026.LDC2009T13	The number of people who were deported, prevented from entering Austria illegally, or told to leave the country on their own accord increased by 14.6 percent in 2006, to 45,869.
5057	APW_ENG_20070105.1026.LDC2009T13	The ministry spokeswoman attributed both results to an Austrian law applying to foreigners that took effect a year ago, saying it sought to separate asylum from immigration and also imposed stricter penalties on human traffickers.

5061	APW_ENG_20070107.0789.LDC2009T13	Police say former Guyanese soldier Rondell Rawlins is the leader of a gang and one of several black-clad invaders who forced their way into Agriculture Minister Satyadeo Sawh's home on the country's coast in late April, killing him along with two of his siblings and a security guard.
5062	APW_ENG_20070107.0789.LDC2009T13	Only one suspect in the case has been arrested and charged with murder.
5063	APW_ENG_20070107.0789.LDC2009T13	Another man believed to be part of the gang was killed in a shootout with police in October.
5064	APW_ENG_20070107.0789.LDC2009T13	First posted in July, the US$10,000 (euro7,900) reward was re- offered in a bid to capture seven men who police believe are hiding near Buxton, a village on the South American nation's east coast.
5065	APW_ENG_20070107.0789.LDC2009T13	Authorities also allege that Rawlins led the gang in a February crime spree that killed eight people in the southern district of Agricola.
5066	APW_ENG_20070107.0789.LDC2009T13	The group has terrorized the country since 2002, police said in a statement.
5067	APW_ENG_20070107.0789.LDC2009T13	Sawh's murder stunned the former British colony and prompted authorities to increase security at the homes and offices of ministers.

5072	APW_ENG_20070108.1122.LDC2009T13	Advertising employees at The Philadelphia Inquirer, Philadelphia Daily News and Philly.com were told of the layoffs on Monday, said Henry Holcomb, president of The Newspaper Guild of Greater Philadelphia.
5073	APW_ENG_20070108.1122.LDC2009T13	There are nearly 300 union members in advertising.
5074	APW_ENG_20070108.1122.LDC2009T13	The layoffs take effect Jan. 22.
5075	APW_ENG_20070108.1122.LDC2009T13	Sixteen of the positions being cut are part-time.
5076	APW_ENG_20070108.1122.LDC2009T13	The advertising cuts come days after owner Philadelphia Media Holdings laid off 71 editorial employees at the Inquirer.
5077	APW_ENG_20070108.1122.LDC2009T13	Three people were offered jobs in another part of the company.

5081	APW_ENG_20070108.1152.LDC2009T13	NEW YORK 2007-01-08 19:13:21 UTC
5082	APW_ENG_20070108.1152.LDC2009T13	The virtual world of "Second Life" is going open source.
5083	APW_ENG_20070108.1152.LDC2009T13	Linden Lab, the company behind the game, said it is making the software blueprint of its PC program available to developers to modify for their personal use and to share with others.
5084	APW_ENG_20070108.1152.LDC2009T13	It is the same model that's used to build the Linux operating system and the Firefox Web browser.
5085	APW_ENG_20070108.1152.LDC2009T13	Philip Rosedale, Linden Lab's co-founder and chief executive officer, said he hopes the developer community will help his relatively small staff -- 50 programmers or so -- fix bugs in the code and optimize the software for use on older computers.
5086	APW_ENG_20070108.1152.LDC2009T13	He also expects some cool tools to emerge.
5087	APW_ENG_20070108.1152.LDC2009T13	"There are lots of handicapped people using 'Second Life,' It's one of the really inspiring things about it," Rosedale said.
5088	APW_ENG_20070108.1152.LDC2009T13	"There are a lot of ways of connecting people to their computers, not just mice and keyboards but gaze detection and neuromuscular stuff" that Linden Lab doesn't have the manpower to address, but he hopes outside programmers will.
5089	APW_ENG_20070108.1152.LDC2009T13	Someone also could "hook up an exercise bike and fly around 'Second Life' while exercising," he said, or write a program for accessing the world from a smart phone.
5090	APW_ENG_20070108.1152.LDC2009T13	"All that becomes extremely easy to do," said Rosedale, who will speak tomorrow at the International Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas.
5091	APW_ENG_20070108.1152.LDC2009T13	"Second Life" users create avatars of themselves and move about the virtual world, chatting with others, buying land, building homes and businesses.
5092	APW_ENG_20070108.1152.LDC2009T13	It has its own currency that is tied to the U.S. dollar.
5093	APW_ENG_20070108.1152.LDC2009T13	Numerous real-world businesses, including Circuit City Stores Inc. and American Apparel Inc., are setting up shop in the virtual space.
5094	APW_ENG_20070108.1152.LDC2009T13	The code will be available under the GNU Public License, a widely used agreement among open-source developers that allows them to legally modify and share software.
5095	APW_ENG_20070108.1152.LDC2009T13	Linden Lab will review and test some add-ons, modifications and bug fixes, and incorporate them into the official version of the viewer, which can be downloaded for free.
5096	APW_ENG_20070108.1152.LDC2009T13	Monday's announcement does not cover all the software behind "Second Life."
5097	APW_ENG_20070108.1152.LDC2009T13	The program that controls the underlying infrastructure will remain proprietary, though Rosedale said open-source "is absolutely our direction."
5098	APW_ENG_20070108.1152.LDC2009T13	The shift toward open source is not expected to hurt the company's business model, which relies on charging residents for their use of land -- also known as server space on one of Linden Lab's computers.

5101	APW_ENG_20070109.1254.LDC2009T13	Italian authorities are seeking the arrest of a British woman suspected of helping her husband, a convicted Mafia boss, run his underworld business empire from prison, police said Tuesday.
5102	APW_ENG_20070109.1254.LDC2009T13	A judge signed an arrest warrant on a charge of mafia association for Ann Hathaway, 44, of Middleton, a town near Manchester, said Maj. Bartolomeo Di Niso, a Carabinieri paramilitary police official who led the investigation in the Sicilian town of Gela.
5103	APW_ENG_20070109.1254.LDC2009T13	Hathaway's warrant was signed on the eve of Dec. 10-11 raids that took place across Italy and led to 87 arrests among alleged members of the clan led by her husband, Antonio Rinzivillo.
5104	APW_ENG_20070109.1254.LDC2009T13	Both Hathaway and another suspect who was sought in the raids are believed to be abroad, Di Niso said.
5105	APW_ENG_20070109.1254.LDC2009T13	Interpol is dealing with Hathaway's case and her exact whereabouts is unknown, he said in a telephone interview.
5106	APW_ENG_20070109.1254.LDC2009T13	Prosecutors believe Hathaway worked as a go-between for her husband, who is serving a life sentence for murder in the northern Italian town of Tolmezzo.
5107	APW_ENG_20070109.1254.LDC2009T13	Hathaway would speak in code while visiting with Rinzivillo and with her brother-in-law, Gino Rinzivillo, who is imprisoned in Rome, Di Niso said.
5108	APW_ENG_20070109.1254.LDC2009T13	She allegedly then relayed orders to mobsters who were managing the clan's nationwide business interests, including extortion, loan-sharking and money laundering, the police official said.

5111	APW_ENG_20070110.0587.LDC2009T13	Italy's budget deficit widened to 6.4 percent of gross domestic product in the third quarter of 2006 from 2.8 percent of GDP in the corresponding quarter of 2005, as state spending rose more than income, statistics office Istat said Wednesday.
5112	APW_ENG_20070110.0587.LDC2009T13	However, in the first nine months of 2006, the budget deficit narrowed to 4.1 percent of GDP from 4.3 percent in the corresponding period of 2005, Istat said.
5113	APW_ENG_20070110.0587.LDC2009T13	The sharp increase in the deficit to GDP ratio, up from 0.3 percent in the second quarter of 2006, was due to the implementation of a European Court of Justice ruling in September, which allows companies to claim refunds for company cars that the state had wrongly denied them, an Istat official said.
5114	APW_ENG_20070110.0587.LDC2009T13	Net of this expense, the deficit to GDP ratio in the third quarter of 2006 would have been 1.7 percent, compared with 2.5 percent in the year-earlier period, an Istat official said.
5115	APW_ENG_20070110.0587.LDC2009T13	In the third quarter, state income was up 4.8 percent on the year, while state spending rose 13.3 percent.
5116	APW_ENG_20070110.0587.LDC2009T13	Istat said Italy's primary deficit was euro7.4 billion (US$9.6 billion) in the third quarter of 2006, or -2 percent of GDP.
5117	APW_ENG_20070110.0587.LDC2009T13	It widened from the same quarter of 2005, when there was a surplus of euro5.87 billion (US$7.64 billion), or 1.7 percent of GDP.
5118	APW_ENG_20070110.0587.LDC2009T13	Current spending rose 3.4 percent, as spending for state employees rose 7 percent on the year, and welfare spending rose 3.9 percent.

5131	APW_ENG_20070111.0227.LDC2009T13	Protests around the world will mark the fifth anniversary Thursday of the arrival of the first 20 prisoners at Guantanamo, including a demonstration on the Cuban side of Guantanamo's gate.
5132	APW_ENG_20070111.0227.LDC2009T13	Critics say the camp, where hundreds of men face indefinite incarceration, has damaged U.S. credibility and should close.
5133	APW_ENG_20070111.0227.LDC2009T13	"It has become iconic in the Muslim world and the wider world ... for everything that the United States has done wrong in the war on terror," said Michael Ratner, president of the New York-based Center for Constitutional Rights.
5134	APW_ENG_20070111.0227.LDC2009T13	The military says the detention center is vital as ever.
5135	APW_ENG_20070111.0227.LDC2009T13	Nearly 400 detainees suspected of links to al-Qaida and the Taliban are still held there.
5136	APW_ENG_20070111.0227.LDC2009T13	"What we are doing is an important and integral part of the global war on terror," Navy Rear Adm. Harry B. Harris, commander of the detention center, told The Associated Press by telephone on Tuesday.
5137	APW_ENG_20070111.0227.LDC2009T13	"We're keeping enemies of our nation -- enemy combatants, terrorists if you will -- off the battlefield."
5138	APW_ENG_20070111.0227.LDC2009T13	Al-Zamil, 44, insisted Tuesday that he had no links to al-Qaida or the Taliban.
5139	APW_ENG_20070111.0227.LDC2009T13	He says he had traveled to Afghanistan to work for a charity before being taken into custody in Pakistan and turned over to U.S. forces.
5140	APW_ENG_20070111.0227.LDC2009T13	He was held in Afghanistan before being transferred to Guantanamo in what he believes was February or March of 2002.
5141	APW_ENG_20070111.0227.LDC2009T13	He and another Kuwaiti, Saad al-Azmi, were forced onto the tarmac in Guantanamo together.
5142	APW_ENG_20070111.0227.LDC2009T13	"We were totally cut off from the world.
5143	APW_ENG_20070111.0227.LDC2009T13	We didn't know what was going on," al-Zamil said by telephone from Kuwait.
5144	APW_ENG_20070111.0227.LDC2009T13	Al-Zamil and al-Azmi later appeared before a military panel that designated them enemy combatants, despite their claims of innocence.
5145	APW_ENG_20070111.0227.LDC2009T13	The panels considered the cases of 558 detainees and found that all but 38 were enemy combatants and should be held.
5146	APW_ENG_20070111.0227.LDC2009T13	Al-Zamil said he was roughed up by guards and interrogators and kept shackled for long periods in cold rooms during his more than three years at the prison.
5147	APW_ENG_20070111.0227.LDC2009T13	"Guantanamo is a part of hell," he said.
5148	APW_ENG_20070111.0227.LDC2009T13	Al-Azmi, 27, described similar experiences, adding that a female interrogator named "Megan" or "Maggie" danced around him partially undressed, then threatened to have a male guard rape him if he did not confess to terrorist links.
5149	APW_ENG_20070111.0227.LDC2009T13	The alleged incidents took place before Harris took command.
5150	APW_ENG_20070111.0227.LDC2009T13	"We don't do anything today that's coercive in nature," he said.
5151	APW_ENG_20070111.0227.LDC2009T13	"I believe we are doing things correctly here."
5152	APW_ENG_20070111.0227.LDC2009T13	The detention camp itself has undergone a transformation since the early days when prisoners were kept in metal open-air cages and used buckets for toilets.
5153	APW_ENG_20070111.0227.LDC2009T13	Harris said conditions for prisoners are better because of the construction of Camp Five and, just last year, Camp Six -- steel- and-concrete buildings modeled after U.S. prisons.
5154	APW_ENG_20070111.0227.LDC2009T13	Human rights groups argue that the buildings, which have solid- wall one-person cells, leave the prisoners more isolated.
5155	APW_ENG_20070111.0227.LDC2009T13	The military plans to charge 60 to 80 of the detainees and expects military trials to start next summer, said Air Force Col. Morris Davis, the chief prosecutor.
5156	APW_ENG_20070111.0227.LDC2009T13	"It certainly looks like we're much closer to getting these guys their day in court," he said.
5157	APW_ENG_20070111.0227.LDC2009T13	Most of the remaining detainees, however, may never be tried by a military court, and the Military Commissions Act, which U.S. President George W. Bush signed in October, deprives them of the right to contest their imprisonment in a civilian court.
5158	APW_ENG_20070111.0227.LDC2009T13	Their best hope is that the military's Annual Review Board will determine they no longer pose a threat to the U.S. or possess intelligence value.
5159	APW_ENG_20070111.0227.LDC2009T13	So far, the military has released or transferred about 380 detainees.
5160	APW_ENG_20070111.0227.LDC2009T13	The AP determined that more than half were later released or cleared of charges by their home countries despite former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld's description of the detainees as "among the most dangerous, best-trained, vicious killers on the face of the earth."
5161	APW_ENG_20070111.0227.LDC2009T13	The two Kuwaitis were sent home in November 2005 and cleared by a court in their home country of all terrorism charges.
5162	APW_ENG_20070111.0227.LDC2009T13	"I'm still trying to regain my life, trying to become a normal citizen," al-Azmi said.
5163	APW_ENG_20070111.0227.LDC2009T13	Al-Zamil said he worries about the detainees he left behind.
5164	APW_ENG_20070111.0227.LDC2009T13	"They are living in hell as we did," he said.
5165	APW_ENG_20070111.0227.LDC2009T13	"I pray to God to give them patience.
5166	APW_ENG_20070111.0227.LDC2009T13	If I was still there I'd be a crazy person."

5168	APW_ENG_20070111.0699.LDC2009T13	NEW DELHI 2007-01-11 10:44:10 UTC
5169	APW_ENG_20070111.0699.LDC2009T13	India's Infosys Technologies Ltd. said Thursday its net profit jumped 52.4 percent in the most recent quarter from a year ago on strong outsourcing orders.
5170	APW_ENG_20070111.0699.LDC2009T13	The company, which writes and develops software for Western companies like Goldman Sachs and J.C. Penney Co., said it added 43 new clients during the quarter.
5171	APW_ENG_20070111.0699.LDC2009T13	"The globalization of services continues to be strong.
5172	APW_ENG_20070111.0699.LDC2009T13	We do not see any reduction in global spending on IT (information technology," said Infosys Chief Executive Nandan Nilekani.
5173	APW_ENG_20070111.0699.LDC2009T13	Infosys' net profit for the October-December quarter rose to US$218 million (euro168 million) from US$143 million in the same period last year, in line with what analysts expected.
5174	APW_ENG_20070111.0699.LDC2009T13	Revenue for the fiscal third quarter expanded 47 percent to US$821 million (euro632 million) from US$559 million a year ago.
5175	APW_ENG_20070111.0699.LDC2009T13	Nilekani said the company was negotiating several major deals, but refused divulge the details.
5176	APW_ENG_20070111.0699.LDC2009T13	The company added 3,282 new employees during the quarter, taking its total headcount to 69,432.
5177	APW_ENG_20070111.0699.LDC2009T13	The company's forecasts for revenue and earnings per share initially disappointed investors, who sent the stock down as much as 2 percent.
5178	APW_ENG_20070111.0699.LDC2009T13	But it later recovered to close 0.8 percent higher at 2,183 rupees on the Bombay Stock Exchange.
5179	APW_ENG_20070111.0699.LDC2009T13	Infosys predicted sales for the fiscal year through March would rise 44 percent to US$3.09 billion (euro2.38 billion).
5180	APW_ENG_20070111.0699.LDC2009T13	The Nasdaq-listed company said earnings per share for the fiscal year would rise 44 percent to US$1.47 (euro1.13).
5181	APW_ENG_20070111.0699.LDC2009T13	Analysts said the company has done well in maintaining its profit margins despite an appreciation of the Indian currency, which erodes revenue when overseas earnings in dollars are converted to rupees.
5182	APW_ENG_20070111.0699.LDC2009T13	"The muted guidance is perhaps based on expectations of a further strengthening of the rupee," said Divya Nagarajan, analyst at Motilal Oswal Securities, a Mumbai-based brokerage firm.
5183	APW_ENG_20070111.0699.LDC2009T13	The rupee appreciated about 2.5 percent during the October- December quarter, said V. Balakrishnan, chief financial officer of Infosys.
5184	APW_ENG_20070111.0699.LDC2009T13	The company's operating margin would have increased at least 2 percent more in rupee terms if there was no appreciation, he said.
5185	APW_ENG_20070111.0699.LDC2009T13	Infosys CEO Nilekani said the company's billing rates -- which in the past came under pressure because of competition -- have become "stable with an upward bias."
5186	APW_ENG_20070111.0699.LDC2009T13	He said the company was also encouraged by new opportunities in China, where a lot of companies are keen to hire Infosys.
5187	APW_ENG_20070111.0699.LDC2009T13	"Apart from the rupee, all the other factors are benign," he said.
5188	APW_ENG_20070111.0699.LDC2009T13	Among new clients, Infosys said it has been hired by a U.S. grocery chain to enhance its information technology system supporting warehouse operations.
5189	APW_ENG_20070111.0699.LDC2009T13	Another new client was a large distributor of paper products in the United States.
5190	APW_ENG_20070111.0699.LDC2009T13	The clients were not identified.
5191	APW_ENG_20070111.0699.LDC2009T13	All the earnings figures released by the company conformed to U.S. accounting standards.

5193	APW_ENG_20070111.1201.LDC2009T13	BEIRUT, Lebanon 2007-01-11 15:48:37 UTC
5194	APW_ENG_20070111.1201.LDC2009T13	A judge demanded life imprisonment on Thursday for six Lebanese suspects accused of being involved in a failed train bombing attempt in Germany, court officials said.
5195	APW_ENG_20070111.1201.LDC2009T13	In his formal charge sheet, investigating Judge Abdul Rahim Hammoud accused the six suspects of trying to kill a large number of people in the attempted attacks, said the officials, speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the media.
5196	APW_ENG_20070111.1201.LDC2009T13	Last year, a Lebanese prosecutor referred the suspects to a magistrate for further questioning on charges of attempting to commit "mass killings and starting fires with flammable materials in German passenger trains" in July.
5197	APW_ENG_20070111.1201.LDC2009T13	Five of the six suspects are in Lebanese custody and have been referred to a criminal court for trial.
5198	APW_ENG_20070111.1201.LDC2009T13	No date for the trial has been set, and information about their attorneys was not available.
5199	APW_ENG_20070111.1201.LDC2009T13	They were arrested in August and September in Lebanon, and Lebanese authorities have insisted on questioning and prosecuting the suspects.
5200	APW_ENG_20070111.1201.LDC2009T13	The sixth, Youssef Mohammed el-Hajdib, 21, is in German custody after he was arrested Aug. 19 in the German city of Kiel.
5201	APW_ENG_20070111.1201.LDC2009T13	Lebanese authorites plan to try him in absentia.
5202	APW_ENG_20070111.1201.LDC2009T13	The two main suspects -- el-Hajdib and Jihad Hamad -- are accused of planting bombs on July 31 in two trains at a railway station in the German city of Cologne, where they were seen in grainy surveillance camera footage pulling wheeled suitcases.
5203	APW_ENG_20070111.1201.LDC2009T13	The bombs were found later in the day on regional trains, and German authorities said that the detonators went off but failed to ignite the devices.
5204	APW_ENG_20070111.1201.LDC2009T13	Another suspect held in Germany is Fadi al-Saleh, a 23-year-old Syrian who was arrested with a computer carrying plans for bombs downloaded from the Internet, German authorities said.
5205	APW_ENG_20070111.1201.LDC2009T13	The head of Germany's Federal Crime Office said last year that the suspects were partially motivated by anger over the September 2005 publication by a Danish magazine of cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad that caused widespread outrage in the Muslim world.
5206	APW_ENG_20070111.1225.LDC2009T13	Beckham to leave Real Madrid for LA Galaxy
5207	APW_ENG_20070111.1225.LDC2009T13	LONDON 2007-01-11 15:58:05 UTC
5208	APW_ENG_20070111.1225.LDC2009T13	David Beckham will leave Real Madrid at the end of the season to join the Los Angeles Galaxy of Major League Soccer in a five-year deal.
5209	APW_ENG_20070111.1225.LDC2009T13	The move was announced Thursday following the end of talks on extending the 31-year-old English midfielder's contract with the Spanish club.
5210	APW_ENG_20070111.1225.LDC2009T13	"This week, Real Madrid asked me to make a decision regarding my future and the offer to extend my contract by a further two seasons," Beckham said in a statement.
5211	APW_ENG_20070111.1225.LDC2009T13	"After discussing several options with my family and advisers to either stay here at Madrid or join other major British and European clubs, I have decided to join the Los Angeles Galaxy and play in the MLS from August this year."
5212	APW_ENG_20070111.1225.LDC2009T13	Beckham's four-year contract with Madrid expires at the end of this season.
5213	APW_ENG_20070111.1225.LDC2009T13	He joined the team from Manchester United in 2003, where he had had won six league titles, two FA Cups and the Champions League title.
5214	APW_ENG_20070111.1225.LDC2009T13	But Beckham, the world's most recognized player, hasn't won a major trophy since joining Madrid.
5215	APW_ENG_20070111.1225.LDC2009T13	"I have enjoyed my time in Spain enormously and I am extremely grateful to the club for giving me the opportunity to play for such a great team and their amazing fans," Beckham said.
5216	APW_ENG_20070111.1225.LDC2009T13	Beckham has been unhappy this season at Madrid under coach Fabio Capello.
5217	APW_ENG_20070111.1225.LDC2009T13	He has started only seven of 25 matches and was left off the squad for Thursday's Copa del Rey match against Real Betis.
5218	APW_ENG_20070111.1225.LDC2009T13	"For the rest of this season I will continue to give 100 percent to my coach, teammates and fans as I believe Fabio Capello will bring this club and its supporters the success they truly deserve," said Beckham, who trained with Madrid in the Spanish capital Thursday.
5219	APW_ENG_20070111.1225.LDC2009T13	Before the season started, Beckham led England to the quarterfinals of the World Cup, scoring from a free kick in the second round to beat Ecuador 1-0.
5220	APW_ENG_20070111.1225.LDC2009T13	But he was taken off the field early in the second half against Portugal with ankle and Achilles tendon injuries, and then watched as his team was eliminated in a penalty shootout.
5221	APW_ENG_20070111.1225.LDC2009T13	A day after the game, Beckham stepped down as captain of the team -- a post he had held for 58 of his 94 international appearances.
5222	APW_ENG_20070111.1225.LDC2009T13	Then, on Aug. 11, England coach Steve McClaren dropped Beckham from the team altogether, signaling the end of his international career.
5223	APW_ENG_20070111.1225.LDC2009T13	Then came more heartache in Madrid.
5224	APW_ENG_20070111.1225.LDC2009T13	He was injured in November when he was allowed to travel to Rome to visit Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes, but Beckham was forced to skip the wedding and return to Madrid to sit on the bench -- another sign that his days in Madrid under Capello were numbered.
5225	APW_ENG_20070111.1225.LDC2009T13	Still, the move to Los Angeles won't surprise many people.
5226	APW_ENG_20070111.1225.LDC2009T13	Beckham has a soccer academy in Carson, California, and his wife Victoria, a former Spice Girl, was recently photographed house- hunting in Los Angeles.
5227	APW_ENG_20070111.1225.LDC2009T13	MLS recently changed its rules on salary caps, clearing the way for Beckham to sign a lucrative deal.
5228	APW_ENG_20070111.1225.LDC2009T13	British news reports put the LA deal at US$250 million.
5229	APW_ENG_20070111.1225.LDC2009T13	"I am proud to have played for two of the biggest clubs in football and I look forward to the new challenge of growing the world's most popular game in a country that is as passionate about its sport as my own," Beckham said.
5230	APW_ENG_20070111.1225.LDC2009T13	Beckham and his wife are worth 87 million pounds (US$169 million), according to Britain's Rich List.
5231	APW_ENG_20070111.1225.LDC2009T13	Beckham alone reportedly makes about euro25 million (US$32 million) per year in salary and endorsements.

5246	APW_ENG_20070112.0504.LDC2009T13	The pair have been in a relationship since 2005 when Catalano came to India.
5247	APW_ENG_20070112.0504.LDC2009T13	The son of former Indian cricket captain Mansur Ali Khan Pataudi and former film star Sharmila Tagore, Khan worked for many years in Bollywood with limited success, before shooting to prominence with major hits like "Dil Chahta Hai" (What the Heart Wants), "Parineeta" (The Wife), "Hum Tum" (Me and You) and "Salaam Namaste" (Hello, Hello) in recent years.

5256	APW_ENG_20070113.0115.LDC2009T13	Several thousand demonstrators remain in the tree-filled plaza in front of the state capital building, and say they will stay there so as long as Reyes is in office.
5257	APW_ENG_20070113.0115.LDC2009T13	Protest leaders said they want to avoid another deadly clash with the governor's supporters.
5258	APW_ENG_20070113.0115.LDC2009T13	"We will not give them the provocation," Omar Fernandez, head of a Cochabamba labor union which helped organize the protests, told The Associated Press.
5259	APW_ENG_20070113.0115.LDC2009T13	"We will continue our vigil here, and we will continue until Manfred Reyes Villa resigns."
5260	APW_ENG_20070113.0115.LDC2009T13	Fernandez said that the protester organizers were preparing to name their own Cochabamba state governor.
5261	APW_ENG_20070113.0115.LDC2009T13	In a series of marches over the last month both city dwellers and coca farmers from the surrounding countryside have marched on the capital to denounced Reyes' support for greater state autonomy from Morales' government.
5262	APW_ENG_20070113.0115.LDC2009T13	Reyes has also criticized Morales' attempts to control an assembly rewriting the country's constitution -- a position unpopular with many in Morales' home state.
5263	APW_ENG_20070113.0115.LDC2009T13	Reyes has said he won't resign and blamed Morales for not reacting more forcefully to protests earlier in the week.
5264	APW_ENG_20070113.0115.LDC2009T13	Thousands of coca growers -- many members of Bolivia's largest coca growers' union, of which Morales still serves as president -- have gone to the capital from the countryside to call for his resignation.
5265	APW_ENG_20070113.0115.LDC2009T13	Morales, speaking Friday after returning from the inauguration of fellow leftist President Daniel Ortega in Nicaragua, blamed Reyes for provoking the protests but called on demonstrators to refrain from further violence.
5266	APW_ENG_20070113.0115.LDC2009T13	"We all want unity and integrity, and the governor of Cochabamba's support for independence has caused a reaction in patriotic people from both the city and the countryside," he said.
5267	APW_ENG_20070113.0115.LDC2009T13	On Thursday several thousand rival demonstrators beat each other with sticks in Cochabamba's picturesque plazas, images that were broadcast on national television.
5268	APW_ENG_20070113.0115.LDC2009T13	Three demonstrators were arrested for carrying handguns, according to government authorities.
5269	APW_ENG_20070113.0115.LDC2009T13	The battle took place on a day when Reyes, a former presidential candidate widely considered to still harbor national ambitions, had traveled to the Bolivian capital La Paz to meet with four other governors on a political strategy opposing Morales.
5270	APW_ENG_20070113.0115.LDC2009T13	Opposition leaders also criticized Morales for not returning immediately from Nicaragua.
5271	APW_ENG_20070113.0115.LDC2009T13	"The president was with foreigner instead of being here in Bolivia facing the situation," said Jorge Quiroga, leader of the conservative opposition party Podemos.
5272	APW_ENG_20070113.0115.LDC2009T13	He called for the Roman Catholic Church to mediate the conflict and "starting with peace in Cochabamba so that we can reconciliation throughout the country."
5273	APW_ENG_20070113.0115.LDC2009T13	Quiroga has called the protests by government supporters a "danger to democracy."
5274	APW_ENG_20070113.0115.LDC2009T13	Morales' efforts to expand his executive power have incensed the opposition governors who head six of nine Bolivian states, many of which have long sought greater autonomy from the central government.
5275	APW_ENG_20070113.0115.LDC2009T13	Tensions between Morales and opposition governors have heightened in recent weeks, with Morales proposing to sending deputies from La Paz to monitor the state governments' activities.
5276	APW_ENG_20070113.0115.LDC2009T13	Opposition governors immediately threatened to send their own delegations to keep a closer eye on Morales.
5277	APW_ENG_20070113.0115.LDC2009T13	Reyes has called for Cochabamba to hold a second vote on a referendum giving the states greater power.
5278	APW_ENG_20070113.0115.LDC2009T13	The referendum was defeated in a nationwide election in July, with 63 percent of Cochabamba voters opposed to autonomy.

5280	APW_ENG_20070114.0347.LDC2009T13	INCHEON, South Korea 2007-01-14 10:27:40 UTC
5281	APW_ENG_20070114.0347.LDC2009T13	The chief U.S. negotiator in free trade talks with South Korea said Sunday that the two sides need to make progress this week toward achieving an agreement.
5282	APW_ENG_20070114.0347.LDC2009T13	Assistant U.S. Trade Representative Wendy Cutler told reporters upon arrival that the sixth round of negotiations, set to begin Monday in Seoul, are important.
5283	APW_ENG_20070114.0347.LDC2009T13	The key objective, she said, is "to get an agreement, a good agreement."
5284	APW_ENG_20070114.0347.LDC2009T13	She said she was "looking forward to a productive week."
5285	APW_ENG_20070114.0347.LDC2009T13	Since launching the talks in June, Seoul and Washington have so far reported little progress toward a deal that, if completed, would be the biggest for the U.S. since the North American Free Trade Agreement of 1993.
5286	APW_ENG_20070114.0347.LDC2009T13	The latest round in the United States last month failed to bridge numerous gaps, including Seoul's request for Washington to change its antidumping laws and patent protections for American pharmaceutical companies.
5287	APW_ENG_20070114.0347.LDC2009T13	Other thorny issues include autos and agriculture.
5288	APW_ENG_20070114.0347.LDC2009T13	Cutler and South Korean counterpart will be in overtime, having missed their initial, albeit informal, goal of wrapping up a basic deal by the end of last year.
5289	APW_ENG_20070114.0347.LDC2009T13	U.S. President George W. Bush's ability to "fast track" an agreement through Congress -- meaning he can submit it for a straight yes-or-no vote without amendments -- expires on July 1.
5290	APW_ENG_20070114.0347.LDC2009T13	But any agreement would have to go to Washington at least 90 days before that because lawmakers would need to review the agreement before a vote.
5291	APW_ENG_20070114.0347.LDC2009T13	The deal also requires approval by South Korean lawmakers.
5292	APW_ENG_20070114.0347.LDC2009T13	An agreement would slash tariffs and other barriers on a wide range of goods and services from the two nations, which already do US$72 billion (euro56 billion) worth of business a year.

5295	APW_ENG_20070114.0499.LDC2009T13	BRUSSELS, Belgium 2007-01-14 14:40:11 UTC
5296	APW_ENG_20070114.0499.LDC2009T13	Some of Europe's most prominent right-wing politicians are uniting in single faction in the European Union's parliament, but other EU lawmakers and political analysts expressed doubts the new group will have much impact on mainstream policies.
5297	APW_ENG_20070114.0499.LDC2009T13	The formation of the Identity, Sovereignty and Tradition group, announced last week, brings together some big names from the fringes of European politics.
5298	APW_ENG_20070114.0499.LDC2009T13	Among them is France's Jean-Marie Le Pen, who is again running for president on a nationalist platform that plays on concerns about immigration, globalization and the contention that France has sacrificed its interests and sovereignty to the European Union.
5299	APW_ENG_20070114.0499.LDC2009T13	Another standout in the group is Alessandra Mussolini, granddaughter of the Italy's wartime Fascist dictator.
5300	APW_ENG_20070114.0499.LDC2009T13	Together they will form the first far-right faction in the European Parliament in more than a decade -- and enjoy, at least briefly, a platform in the spotlight to call for action on some of the issues that dominate the debate among Europe's right-wing figures: namely limits on immigration and resisting the EU's drive for closer integration among its 27 member nations.
5301	APW_ENG_20070114.0499.LDC2009T13	The group's formation also means it will be able to secure EU funding that can be used for campaigning and promoting its ideas.
5302	APW_ENG_20070114.0499.LDC2009T13	The 20 members from seven countries -- the minimum required to form a group in the 785-seat parliament -- will be led by Bruno Gollnisch, the No. 2 behind Le Pen in France's National Front party.
5303	APW_ENG_20070114.0499.LDC2009T13	Le Pen's daughter also joins them in the new EU parliament group.
5304	APW_ENG_20070114.0499.LDC2009T13	Other members include three deputies from Belgium's nationalist Flemish Interest Party and a Bulgarian who caused a stir in the parliament last year when, still as an observer, he used racial slurs against a Hungarian lawmaker of Roma, or Gypsy, origin.
5305	APW_ENG_20070114.0499.LDC2009T13	Across Europe, nationalist politicians have made gains in recent elections, including in Belgium where Flemish Interest is now the strongest party in the country's Dutch-speaking north.
5306	APW_ENG_20070114.0499.LDC2009T13	The far-right has a steady following in France, with Le Pen's presidential bid currently polling around 12 percent support, and in countries such as Austria and Slovakia.
5307	APW_ENG_20070114.0499.LDC2009T13	German Chancellor Angela Merkel spoke out in a radio interview Sunday against the trend toward extremism and said her country would address the issue during its turn in the rotating presidency of the EU, which it took over this month.
5308	APW_ENG_20070114.0499.LDC2009T13	At a news conference last week presenting the new EU parliament faction, Gollnisch tried to shake the extremist label, portraying his group as a mix of businessmen, doctors, journalists, professors and artists.
5309	APW_ENG_20070114.0499.LDC2009T13	"I don't know where the hooligans are," said Gollnisch, who is awaiting a verdict from a French court in a trial over remarks in which he questioned the existence of Nazi gas chambers.
5310	APW_ENG_20070114.0499.LDC2009T13	Other EU lawmakers said they would shun the new group and questioned whether it would be able to amass any significant influence.
5311	APW_ENG_20070114.0499.LDC2009T13	"The likely formation of an extreme group ... is a sad reflection of the reality of today's Europe," said Daniel Cohn-Bendit, leader of the Greens in the EU assembly.
5312	APW_ENG_20070114.0499.LDC2009T13	"The extreme right (EU lawmakers) already sit in this house and the fact that they are organized will not give them more influence.
5313	APW_ENG_20070114.0499.LDC2009T13	They will remain marginal."
5314	APW_ENG_20070114.0499.LDC2009T13	Experts say that the formation of the new group will not alter the balance of power in the European Parliament.
5315	APW_ENG_20070114.0499.LDC2009T13	"In terms of real political clout this doesn't change much.
5316	APW_ENG_20070114.0499.LDC2009T13	It really seems more like a publicity stunt," said Guillaume Durand, a policy analyst at the Brussels-based European Policy Center.
5317	APW_ENG_20070114.0499.LDC2009T13	But as an official political grouping, rather than a lose alliance of politicians, it will be eligible for more speaking time, more attractive time slots and several hundred thousand euros in EU funds.
5318	APW_ENG_20070114.0499.LDC2009T13	The group, expected to be officially presented this week during a plenary sitting in Strasbourg, France, opposes efforts to adopt an EU constitution and expand the bloc to take in new members.
5319	APW_ENG_20070114.0499.LDC2009T13	It is also an advocate for the national interests over those of the EU.
5320	APW_ENG_20070114.0499.LDC2009T13	Ironically, its formation was only possible with the arrival of new EU members Romania and Bulgaria on Jan. 1.
5321	APW_ENG_20070114.0499.LDC2009T13	The addition of several right-wing lawmakers from those two countries allowed the group to reach a minimum membership to form a parliamentary faction.

5323	APW_ENG_20070115.1140.LDC2009T13	BELGRADE, Serbia 2007-01-15 18:02:50 UTC
5324	APW_ENG_20070115.1140.LDC2009T13	Serbia's prime minister said Monday that Russian President Vladimir Putin has offered assurances that Moscow would oppose any settlement for the breakaway Kosovo province that violates Serbia's integrity.
5325	APW_ENG_20070115.1140.LDC2009T13	Vojislav Kostunica spoke in Belgrade after a telephone conversation with Putin in Moscow.
5326	APW_ENG_20070115.1140.LDC2009T13	Kostunica said the Russian leader told him that "the U.N. Security Council cannot support a solution by the special U.N. envoy for Kosovo Martti Ahtisaari that is not acceptable to Belgrade."
5327	APW_ENG_20070115.1140.LDC2009T13	Putin said in September that his country may use its veto power in the U.N. Security Council if it disagrees with a proposal by Ahtisaari.
5328	APW_ENG_20070115.1140.LDC2009T13	Ahtisaari last year mediated mostly inconclusive talks on Kosovo's future.
5329	APW_ENG_20070115.1140.LDC2009T13	In a few weeks, he is expected to propose a solution -- possibly some form of independence -- for the province.
5330	APW_ENG_20070115.1140.LDC2009T13	Kosovo's majority ethnic-Albanian population wants independence, but Belgrade has vowed never to agree to that.
5331	APW_ENG_20070115.1140.LDC2009T13	A Kremlin statement said that during a Serbian-initiated telephone conversation, Putin "affirmed Russia's fundamental position" on the issue of Kosovo -- that any solution must be acceptable to Serbia.
5332	APW_ENG_20070115.1140.LDC2009T13	Ahtisaari's widely anticipated but as yet unannounced proposal would need U.N. Security Council approval before becoming an internationally accepted solution for the troubled province, which has been an international protectorate since 1999.
5333	APW_ENG_20070115.1140.LDC2009T13	"Putin has stressed that a (Kosovo) solution must be derived ... from the principles of territorial integrity and sovereignty of existing countries," Kostunica told reporters, reiterating that Serbia would lose 15 percent of its territory if Kosovo breaks away.
5334	APW_ENG_20070115.1140.LDC2009T13	Formally still part of Serbia, Kosovo has been run by a U.N. mission and NATO troops since the 1998-1999 war there between Serbian troops and the separatists.
5335	APW_ENG_20070115.1140.LDC2009T13	The fighting ended when NATO bombed Serbs and forced them to pull out of Kosovo.
5336	APW_ENG_20070115.1140.LDC2009T13	Moscow has not specified what solution for Kosovo it would like to see, but Kostunica said Putin believes anything without consent from both sides would "lead to unnecessary conflicts."
5337	APW_ENG_20070115.1140.LDC2009T13	Russia also suggested that a status decision should not be rushed and that Kosovo's leadership must do more to protect the rights of the Serb minority in Kosovo and enable the return of Serb refugees.
5338	APW_ENG_20070115.1140.LDC2009T13	A spokeswoman for Kosovo's predominantly ethnic Albanian government, Ulpiana Lama, suggested that Kosovo should not be regarded as Serbian territory.
5339	APW_ENG_20070115.1140.LDC2009T13	"We want to assure all sides concerned that Kosovo will respect Serbia's integrity and not make territorial claims over the Presevo Valley," she said.
5340	APW_ENG_20070115.1140.LDC2009T13	The valley is another, adjacent territory with a sizable ethnic Albanian community, but deeper in Serbia proper.
5341	APW_ENG_20070115.1140.LDC2009T13	Kostunica thanked Putin profusely for the support, adding that "Putin's word ... has brought about a turnaround" in debates on Kosovo's future.

5374	APW_ENG_20070118.0863.LDC2009T13	KIEV, Ukraine 2007-01-18 13:13:34 UTC
5375	APW_ENG_20070118.0863.LDC2009T13	Ukrainian President Viktor Yushchenko notified parliament on Thursday that he intends to veto a bill that would weaken the powers of the presidency in this ex-Soviet republic.
5376	APW_ENG_20070118.0863.LDC2009T13	Yushchenko's announcement suggests the increasingly sidelined leader is preparing to take a harder stance in his escalating power struggle with Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovych.
5377	APW_ENG_20070118.0863.LDC2009T13	Yushchenko vetoed the Cabinet bill once, but parliament overrode his veto last Friday.
5378	APW_ENG_20070118.0863.LDC2009T13	Under the country's constitution, the president had two weeks to sign the measure into law -- if he refuses, the parliament speaker could bypass him and sign it.
5379	APW_ENG_20070118.0863.LDC2009T13	But Yushchenko's office appeared to have found a loophole Thursday, noting that the measure passed Friday differed slightly -- on one page -- from the law Yushchenko already vetoed.
5380	APW_ENG_20070118.0863.LDC2009T13	"Consequently, the head of state ... may use his right to veto the corresponding law," the president's office said.
5381	APW_ENG_20070118.0863.LDC2009T13	The Cabinet bill was supposed to help clarify the division of power between the president's office and the premier's Cabinet, but Yushchenko complained that instead it just disrupted the balance of power, giving more to Yanukovych.
5382	APW_ENG_20070118.0863.LDC2009T13	Under the measure, Yushchenko would see his right to appoint the foreign and defense ministers limited, and his influence over regional leaders weakened.
5383	APW_ENG_20070118.0863.LDC2009T13	Yushchenko had proposed 42 changes to the measure, but parliament rejected all of his suggestions.
5384	APW_ENG_20070118.0863.LDC2009T13	Yushchenko has also said Ukraine's Constitutional Court must consider whether the bill violates the Constitution.

5386	APW_ENG_20070118.1078.LDC2009T13	RABAT, Morocco 2007-01-18 15:21:47 UTC
5387	APW_ENG_20070118.1078.LDC2009T13	A leading Moroccan journalist and critic of Morocco's King Mohamed VI announced Thursday he is resigning under mounting pressure from the government.
5388	APW_ENG_20070118.1078.LDC2009T13	Aboubakr Jamai, gadfly editor of the political weekly Le Journal Hebdomadaire, told The Associated Press he is stepping down immediately to save the publication.
5389	APW_ENG_20070118.1078.LDC2009T13	Jamai has been hit with numerous government-backed libel suits and fines, and said disentangling his debts from the magazine's finances was essential to keeping it afloat.
5390	APW_ENG_20070118.1078.LDC2009T13	The government has said the prosecution of Jamai is not intended to sink the Le Journal Hebdomadaire.
5391	APW_ENG_20070118.1078.LDC2009T13	The weekly's co-founder Ali Amar will take over Jamai's post.
5392	APW_ENG_20070118.1078.LDC2009T13	Jamai's departure was prompted by an order from the Justice Ministry last month that Jamai and former Le Journal Hebdomadaire journalist Fahd Iraqi pay damages of 3 million dirhams (US$349,000
5393	APW_ENG_20070118.1078.LDC2009T13	euro270,000) in one of the many suits against Jamai -- the largest such fine in Moroccan history.
5394	APW_ENG_20070118.1078.LDC2009T13	Jamai said he plans to move abroad with his family, but he hasn't decided where he will go or what he will do.
5395	APW_ENG_20070118.1078.LDC2009T13	Jamai said he would not continue to write for Le Journal Hebdomadaire from abroad, saying that doing so would help the government "succeed in tricking people that there's true freedom of press in this country."
5396	APW_ENG_20070118.1078.LDC2009T13	The libel suits, and the conviction of two journalists this week over jokes their weekly published relating to Islam, have led to concerns that the North African kingdom may be backsliding on moves in recent years to relax long-standing restrictions on the media.
5397	APW_ENG_20070118.1106.LDC2009T13	Report: Iraqi leader says U.S. should provide better weapons in comments critical of Bush
5398	APW_ENG_20070118.1106.LDC2009T13	ROME 2007-01-18 15:33:06 UTC
5399	APW_ENG_20070118.1106.LDC2009T13	Iraq's prime minister said security forces would have better control over their country if the United States had equipped them with more -- and better -- weapons, speaking during an interview in which he was deeply critical of Washington, an Italian daily reported Thursday.
5400	APW_ENG_20070118.1106.LDC2009T13	In comments on U.S. President George W. Bush's revised strategy for the country, Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki also told Milan- based Corriere della Sera that the situation in Iraq would not be so dire if the Americans had moved faster .
5401	APW_ENG_20070118.1106.LDC2009T13	"The situation would be much better if the United States had immediately sent our security forces more adequate weapons and equipment.
5402	APW_ENG_20070118.1106.LDC2009T13	If they had committed themselves more and with greater speed we would have had a lot fewer deaths among Iraqi civilians and American soldiers," al-Maliki was quoted as saying by Corriere.
5403	APW_ENG_20070118.1106.LDC2009T13	But in Baghdad, an Iraqi government spokesman, Ali al-Dabbagh, denied that al-Maliki made the comments to Corriere.
5404	APW_ENG_20070118.1106.LDC2009T13	"The news circulated by the media about the Iraqi prime minister's declaration regarding relations with American administration are baseless."
5405	APW_ENG_20070118.1106.LDC2009T13	The newspaper stood by its reporting Thursday.
5406	APW_ENG_20070118.1106.LDC2009T13	Paolo Lepri, Corriere's foreign editor, said the interview had been taped.
5407	APW_ENG_20070118.1106.LDC2009T13	According to Corriere, the Iraqi leader stopped short of openly criticizing Bush's plan to send 21,500 more American troops to join the estimated 130,000 already in Iraq.
5408	APW_ENG_20070118.1106.LDC2009T13	"We have to see how the situation in the field will go," he told the newspaper.
5409	APW_ENG_20070118.1106.LDC2009T13	"We cannot rule out that the situation will drastically improve, allowing U.S. troops to leave the country in great numbers in three to six months."
5410	APW_ENG_20070118.1106.LDC2009T13	Al-Maliki was deeply critical of the Bush administration during the interview, and Corriere quoted the Iraqi leader as saying Bush had capitulated to domestic pressure when he criticized the hanging of former leader Saddam Hussein.
5411	APW_ENG_20070118.1106.LDC2009T13	"It seems to me that Bush is capitulating under the weight of internal pressure
5412	APW_ENG_20070118.1106.LDC2009T13	he is overwhelmed by the media and by the politicians.
5413	APW_ENG_20070118.1106.LDC2009T13	Maybe he has lost control of the situation," he said.
5414	APW_ENG_20070118.1106.LDC2009T13	On Tuesday, Bush said Saddam's execution looked like "kind of a revenge killing" and said it showed that al-Maliki's government "has still got some maturation to do."
5415	APW_ENG_20070118.1106.LDC2009T13	Al-Maliki reiterated that Saddam's trial and execution had been carried out according to Iraqi law and Islamic rules, and "had nothing to do with sectarian vendettas."
5416	APW_ENG_20070118.1106.LDC2009T13	Still, he acknowledged that mistakes had been made during Saddam's hanging, and said he had ordered those who shouted slogans against the former president to stand trial.
5417	APW_ENG_20070118.1106.LDC2009T13	The Dec. 30 hanging of Saddam raised widespread criticism when video showed his executioners taunting him on the gallows and shouting Shiite slogans.
5418	APW_ENG_20070118.1106.LDC2009T13	The gruesome decapitation of Saddam's half brother during his execution Monday prompted more international condemnation.
5419	APW_ENG_20070118.1106.LDC2009T13	Barzan Ibrahim plunged through the trap door and was beheaded by the jerk of the thick rope at the end of his fall
5420	APW_ENG_20070118.1106.LDC2009T13	the Iraqi government said the decapitation was an accident.

5450	APW_ENG_20070122.0888.LDC2009T13	In design victory, Intel will partner with Sun Microsystems on server chips, source says
5451	APW_ENG_20070122.0888.LDC2009T13	SAN FRANCISCO 2007-01-22 14:53:32 UTC
5452	APW_ENG_20070122.0888.LDC2009T13	Server and software maker Sun Microsystems Inc. has agreed to use chips from Intel Corp. in some of its servers and for Intel to endorse Sun's Solaris operating system, a person close to the deal told the AP.
5453	APW_ENG_20070122.0888.LDC2009T13	An announcement is expected Monday, according to the person, who requested anonymity because the deal had not been made public.
5454	APW_ENG_20070122.0888.LDC2009T13	Specifics of the arrangement were not disclosed.
5455	APW_ENG_20070122.0888.LDC2009T13	The companies scheduled a joint news conference with Intel Chief Executive Officer Paul Otellini and Sun CEO Jonathan Schwartz for Monday morning in San Francisco to announce the alliance.
5456	APW_ENG_20070122.0888.LDC2009T13	Intel's stock was trading up 10 cents at $20.92, and Sun shares rose 3 cents to $5.74, both in morning trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market.
5457	APW_ENG_20070122.0888.LDC2009T13	The deal marks a major design win for Intel, the world's largest computer chip maker, which has been fighting to reverse plunging profits and regain market share lost to archrival Advanced Micro Devices Inc.
5458	APW_ENG_20070122.0888.LDC2009T13	It is also a sizable victory for Sun as the company continues its long climb back to profitability following the dot-com collapse and seeks more mainstream adoption of its servers and software products.
5459	APW_ENG_20070122.0888.LDC2009T13	Shawn Dainas, spokesman for Sun Microsystems, declined to comment.
5460	APW_ENG_20070122.0888.LDC2009T13	Intel spokesman Tom Beermann also declined to comment.
5461	APW_ENG_20070122.0888.LDC2009T13	The partnership comes amid an intensifying fight for market share between Intel and AMD.
5462	APW_ENG_20070122.0888.LDC2009T13	Both companies have been slashing prices and incurring heavy expenses to transition to a more advanced manufacturing technology that will allow them to shrink the size of the circuitry on their chips.
5463	APW_ENG_20070122.0888.LDC2009T13	They have also been waging an inch-by-inch battle for market share that has been particularly painful for Intel, whose previous generations of chips began falling out of favor for their high energy consumption.
5464	APW_ENG_20070122.0888.LDC2009T13	Last year, Intel lost more than 5 percent of the overall computer chip market to AMD, according to Mercury Research.
5465	APW_ENG_20070122.0888.LDC2009T13	Longtime Intel loyalist Dell Inc. said it would also begin using AMD chips in its PCs and servers.
5466	APW_ENG_20070122.0888.LDC2009T13	Some of AMD's most dramatic market-share gains have come in the high-margin server and laptop markets, areas where Intel traditionally had little competition.
5467	APW_ENG_20070122.0888.LDC2009T13	However, Intel, which still commands about three quarters of the overall chip market, fired back at AMD last year by unveiling a new line of chips based on an upgraded design that industry observers cheered for delivering higher performance while giving off less heat.
5468	APW_ENG_20070122.0888.LDC2009T13	The competitive pressure appears to be taking its toll on AMD, which is scheduled to report fourth-quarter earnings on Tuesday and has warned investors that plunging processor prices would "substantially" reduce operating income for the quarter.
5469	APW_ENG_20070122.0888.LDC2009T13	AMD's focus on energy-efficiency helped the company lure away clients like Sun while Intel was still overhauling its product line.
5470	APW_ENG_20070122.0888.LDC2009T13	AMD and Sun entered into a partnership in 2003, and in recent years Sun has relied exclusively on AMD to supply server chips based on the popular x86 microarchitecture, or design, used in many personal computers and servers.
5471	APW_ENG_20070122.0888.LDC2009T13	Intel was also providing processors for Sun's x86 server line at the time, but was pushed aside out of concerns about the chips' power consumption.
5472	APW_ENG_20070122.0888.LDC2009T13	Under the current deal, Intel will again provide chips for Sun's x86 line, though this time its Xeon processors are more powerful and boast dramatically improved energy-saving features.
5473	APW_ENG_20070122.0888.LDC2009T13	Sun, which also makes its own line of Sparc branded processors, will still use AMD chips in some of its products, the person close to the deal said.
5474	APW_ENG_20070122.0888.LDC2009T13	Sun, which is scheduled to report second-quarter earnings on Tuesday, is still clawing its way back to profitability after its gutting during the dot-com fallout.
5475	APW_ENG_20070122.0888.LDC2009T13	The Santa Clara-based company has lost more than $5 billion (euro3.9 billion) since 2002, after tech-related spending dried up and demand plummeted for high-priced servers like Sun's that were snapped up during the boom but fell idle after the dot-com bust.
5476	APW_ENG_20070122.0888.LDC2009T13	Intel's endorsement of the company's Solaris operating system is also an important victory for Sun, as many servers that use chips based on the x86 design often run on Linux or Microsoft Corp.'s Windows operating system.
5477	APW_ENG_20070122.0888.LDC2009T13	Rumors of a Sun-Intel partnership had circulated since Friday, when Banc of America Securities analyst Sumit Dhanda wrote in a research note that Sun was considering using Intel's Xeon processors for its fast-growing x86-based server product lines.
5478	APW_ENG_20070122.0888.LDC2009T13	Though Sun is a "fairly small player" in the market for x86-based servers, coming in sixth in terms of market share, Dhanda said, the company's sales in that market are growing rapidly.
5479	APW_ENG_20070122.0888.LDC2009T13	Dhanda said such a partnership could allow Intel to gain as much as 50 percent of Sun's x86 business, which could translate into $25 million (euro19.3 million) to $50 million (euro38.6 million) in lost revenues for AMD.
5480	APW_ENG_20070122.0888.LDC2009T13	"(W)hile the impact to Intel financials is not meaningful in the near-term, we think the shift away from AMD bodes well for momentum in Intel's server business over the course of the upcoming quarters," Dhanda said in the note.

5482	APW_ENG_20070123.1359.LDC2009T13	OKLAHOMA CITY 2007-01-23 17:20:54 UTC
5483	APW_ENG_20070123.1359.LDC2009T13	Oil and gas company Devon Energy Corp. on Tuesday said it plans to sell all its assets in West Africa and focus instead on North America, Brazil and China.
5484	APW_ENG_20070123.1359.LDC2009T13	The company, which is one of the world's leading independent oil and gas producers, plans to use any proceeds to pay off debt and buy back stock.
5485	APW_ENG_20070123.1359.LDC2009T13	The properties -- including an interest in a field operated by Exxon Mobil Corp. in Equatorial Guinea -- held estimated proved reserves of about 90 million barrels of oil equivalent as of Dec. 31, or about 4 percent of Devon's total proved reserves.
5486	APW_ENG_20070123.1359.LDC2009T13	"Proved reserves" refers to crude oil and natural gas that is "reasonably certain" to be commercially producible using current technology at current prices.
5487	APW_ENG_20070123.1359.LDC2009T13	Devon said it expects production of about 11 million barrels of oil equivalent in 2007 from the properties, which are also in Gabon and Cote d'Ivoire on Africa's western coast.
5488	APW_ENG_20070123.1359.LDC2009T13	The company sees greater opportunities in the Gulf of Mexico, where it is drilling 30,000 feet (9,000 meters) down to produce oil.
5489	APW_ENG_20070123.1359.LDC2009T13	"The significant growth opportunities we have developed onshore in North America and in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico are providing compelling rationale for redeploying our financial and intellectual capital in these areas," President John Richels said.
5490	APW_ENG_20070123.1359.LDC2009T13	"As a result of the West African divestitures, we will sharpen our focus in North America," he said.
5491	APW_ENG_20070123.1359.LDC2009T13	"At the same time we will be concentrating our international operations in Brazil and China, where we have established competitive advantages."
5492	APW_ENG_20070123.1359.LDC2009T13	Company spokesman Chip Minty said political instability in West Africa did not factor into the divestiture decision.

5560	APW_ENG_20070126.0472.LDC2009T13	KOBE, Japan 2007-01-26 08:19:17 UTC
5561	APW_ENG_20070126.0472.LDC2009T13	International regulators adopted a plan Friday aimed at slowing the decline in global tuna stocks by reining in illegal fishing, controlling the growth of fleets and sharing data on stock assessments.
5562	APW_ENG_20070126.0472.LDC2009T13	The details of the final version were not immediately released, but delegates hailed it as an important first step in the battle to keep overfishing from wiping out tuna stocks.
5563	APW_ENG_20070126.0472.LDC2009T13	"Maybe the steps we made this week seem small, but this is a big step, a historical step, I think," said the chair of the meeting, Masanori Miyahara, of Japan's Fisheries Agency.
5564	APW_ENG_20070126.0472.LDC2009T13	Conservationists, however, expressed disappointment the plan did not go far enough to put controls on the industry and address the environmental damage caused by tuna fishing.
5565	APW_ENG_20070126.0472.LDC2009T13	"We do see this meeting as a failure," said Alistair Graham of WWF International.
5566	APW_ENG_20070126.0472.LDC2009T13	The meeting took place amid rising concerns about the sustainability of the world's tuna supply.
5567	APW_ENG_20070126.0472.LDC2009T13	The final report had been expected to call for closer communication among regulators, especially in sharing information on illegal fishing, scientific calculations of the size of tuna stocks and other issues, delegates said.
5568	APW_ENG_20070126.0472.LDC2009T13	"It's a common heritage and it's being destroyed," said David Bevan, Canadian Fisheries and Oceans assistant deputy minister.
5569	APW_ENG_20070126.0472.LDC2009T13	"It needs to be protected."
5570	APW_ENG_20070126.0472.LDC2009T13	By 2004, for example, the number of adult Atlantic bluefin tuna capable of spawning had plummeted to roughly 19 percent of the 1975 level in the western half of the ocean, according to the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas.
5571	APW_ENG_20070126.0472.LDC2009T13	The meeting in Kobe, however, also highlighted some of the conflicts among participants.
5572	APW_ENG_20070126.0472.LDC2009T13	Japan, for instance, is campaigning for limits on fishing of smaller tuna, while Europe has resisted the move to protect its canned tuna industry.
5573	APW_ENG_20070126.0472.LDC2009T13	Larger countries want to limit fishing capacity, but poorer island nations want to expand their fleets.
5574	APW_ENG_20070126.0472.LDC2009T13	Another key issue is stepped-up monitoring of the regulatory bodies themselves, which have been criticized by conservationists for failing to stop the depletion of tuna stocks.
5575	APW_ENG_20070126.0472.LDC2009T13	Some countries, such as the United States, Canada and Australia, are pushing for tougher oversight for regulators.
5576	APW_ENG_20070126.0472.LDC2009T13	"There is a commitment to review performance with a common methodology," said David Balton, U.S. deputy assistant secretary of state for oceans and fisheries.
5577	APW_ENG_20070126.0472.LDC2009T13	"We're looking to create a scorecard."
5578	APW_ENG_20070126.0472.LDC2009T13	A major issue at the conference was excess capacity in fishing fleets.
5579	APW_ENG_20070126.0472.LDC2009T13	Critics say excess capacity and profits are determining how many tuna are caught.
5580	APW_ENG_20070126.0472.LDC2009T13	They argue instead that regulators should decide how many fish can be caught, and then tailor the size of fleets to fit those limits.
5581	APW_ENG_20070126.0472.LDC2009T13	"It's overcapacity that causes a lot of these problems," said D.G. Webster, a researcher at the Wrigley Institute for Environmental Studies in Los Angeles, California.
5582	APW_ENG_20070126.0472.LDC2009T13	Webster, however, was not optimistic about progress on cutting fishing fleets, in part because it's difficult to move fishermen into other industries.
5583	APW_ENG_20070126.0472.LDC2009T13	"It's too hard because nobody wants to give up boats," she said.
5584	APW_ENG_20070126.0472.LDC2009T13	Cracking down on so-called tuna pirates was also under discussion.
5585	APW_ENG_20070126.0472.LDC2009T13	Overfishing and poaching are largely to blame for tumbling stocks worldwide, conservationists say.
5586	APW_ENG_20070126.0472.LDC2009T13	Renegade boats are known to fly the flags of countries with weak regulations, for instance, knowing that their overfishing will not be noticed.
5587	APW_ENG_20070126.0472.LDC2009T13	Smaller boats, meanwhile, are not properly regulated under current rules.
5588	APW_ENG_20070126.0472.LDC2009T13	One possibility discussed was electronic tagging of legally fished tuna when they're caught.
5589	APW_ENG_20070126.0472.LDC2009T13	Some countries already use plastic tags, but delegates said that program could be expanded to cheap, easily traceable electronic tags.
5590	APW_ENG_20070126.0472.LDC2009T13	Japan's role as host of the Kobe conference is highly symbolic because it is a major tuna consumer, accounting for 12 percent of the 2.06 million ton global catch.
5591	APW_ENG_20070126.0472.LDC2009T13	Japanese eat about a quarter of the world's supply of the five big species: bluefin, southern bluefin, bigeye, yellowfin and albacore.
5592	APW_ENG_20070126.0472.LDC2009T13	Representatives from the commercial fishing industry, environmental groups and government regulators were attending the conference.

5618	APW_ENG_20070130.0577.LDC2009T13	WASHINGTON 2007-01-30 10:36:26 UTC
5619	APW_ENG_20070130.0577.LDC2009T13	Journalists will take center stage Tuesday at the CIA leak trial as Special Prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald begins calling reporters as witnesses.
5620	APW_ENG_20070130.0577.LDC2009T13	Fitzgerald said Judith Miller was to take the stand Tuesday, the first time the former New York Times reporter has testified publicly against the man she went to jail to protect as a source.
5621	APW_ENG_20070130.0577.LDC2009T13	Vice President Dick Cheney's former chief of staff, I. Lewis "Scooter" Libby, is accused of perjury and obstruction for lying about conversations he had with journalists about outed CIA operative Valerie Plame.
5622	APW_ENG_20070130.0577.LDC2009T13	Prosecutors want to show that Libby lied to investigators about his conversations with journalists regarding Plame, who believes she was outed as retribution for her husband's criticism of the Bush administration's prewar intelligence on Iraq.
5623	APW_ENG_20070130.0577.LDC2009T13	The original source of the leak, former Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage, has already confirmed his role and Libby is not charged with the leak.
5624	APW_ENG_20070130.0577.LDC2009T13	Miller spent 85 days in jail for refusing to cooperate with Fitzgerald's investigation and reveal her conversations with Libby.
5625	APW_ENG_20070130.0577.LDC2009T13	She retired from the Times in November 2005, declaring that she had to leave because she had "become the news."
5626	APW_ENG_20070130.0577.LDC2009T13	Prosecutors say Libby discussed Plame -- the wife of prominent Iraq war critic Joseph Wilson -- with Miller three times.
5627	APW_ENG_20070130.0577.LDC2009T13	Two of those conversations occurred before Libby says he first remembered learning Plame's identity from another reporter, NBC newsman Tim Russert.
5628	APW_ENG_20070130.0577.LDC2009T13	Libby now says his memory failed him when he spoke to Russert.
5629	APW_ENG_20070130.0577.LDC2009T13	Russert said Monday that he did not tell Libby about Plame.
5630	APW_ENG_20070130.0577.LDC2009T13	"I was not and never have been the recipient of the leak," Russert told an audience in Oklahoma City.
5631	APW_ENG_20070130.0577.LDC2009T13	Such discrepancies are at the heart of Libby's trial.
5632	APW_ENG_20070130.0577.LDC2009T13	Previous witnesses, including former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer, have testified they had conversations with Libby about Plame before his conversation with Russert.
5633	APW_ENG_20070130.0577.LDC2009T13	After Miller ultimately decided to testify, saying Libby had given her permission to do so, the Times published an article describing Miller as a rogue reporter who battled with editors and colleagues.
5634	APW_ENG_20070130.0577.LDC2009T13	Like so many other government witnesses in the case, Miller's credibility will be an issue under cross-examination.
5635	APW_ENG_20070130.0577.LDC2009T13	She made some inconsistent statements in her grand jury testimony, defense attorneys say.
5636	APW_ENG_20070130.0577.LDC2009T13	Journalism groups have criticized Fitzgerald for calling reporters as witnesses and demanding they discuss conversations with sources.
5637	APW_ENG_20070130.0577.LDC2009T13	Miller's notes likely will be used as evidence, and Fitzgerald is expected to call two other reporters -- Russert and Matthew Cooper of Time magazine -- during the trial.
5638	APW_ENG_20070130.0577.LDC2009T13	Miller shared in a Pulitzer Prize for reporting on terrorism, but her relationship with the Times was strained when it was discovered that her reporting on the existence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq -- the Bush administration's primary reason to go to war -- was built on faulty intelligence.

5641	APW_ENG_20070130.0743.LDC2009T13	Dutch troops will not participate in destruction of poppy crops in Afghanistan
5642	APW_ENG_20070130.0743.LDC2009T13	AMSTERDAM, Netherlands 2007-01-30 12:33:20 UTC
5643	APW_ENG_20070130.0743.LDC2009T13	Dutch soldiers serving in the NATO force in Afghanistan will not take part in the destruction of opium poppy crops because it is counterproductive to efforts to build public support for reconstruction, a government minister said.
5644	APW_ENG_20070130.0743.LDC2009T13	The minister of development, Agnes van Ardenne, said late Monday that the ultimate purpose of Dutch participation in the NATO stabilization force in Afghanistan is to promote reconstruction.
5645	APW_ENG_20070130.0743.LDC2009T13	"That's only possible if the population is working with us, but the population won't do that if people see that we, as it were, are playing along with the game of destroying the income stream, the only income stream of very many farmers," Van Ardenne said on the television program Nova.
5646	APW_ENG_20070130.0743.LDC2009T13	The cultivation of poppies -- used to produce opium, morphine and heroin -- reached record levels in Afghanistan in 2006, and U.S. officials have focused attention on plans to destroy the crop.
5647	APW_ENG_20070130.0743.LDC2009T13	Opium sales are believed to help fund the Taliban, but also may make up more than a quarter of the country's economy, according to a World Bank study published in November.
5648	APW_ENG_20070130.0743.LDC2009T13	Opium production from poppies in Afghanistan last year rose 49 percent to 6,700 tons, enough to supply 90 percent of the world's heroin, according to the U.N.
5649	APW_ENG_20070130.0743.LDC2009T13	NATO's International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan, which recently increased in size to 32,000 troops, works together with the Afghan government to carry out reconstruction projects in the country's provinces.
5650	APW_ENG_20070130.0743.LDC2009T13	Until now, ISAF's focus has often been on peacekeeping, but it plans major pushes on both quelling the Taliban insurgency and reconstruction efforts this spring.
5651	APW_ENG_20070130.0743.LDC2009T13	Washington hopes ISAF will actively participate in poppy eradication projects, which have so far been ineffectual.
5652	APW_ENG_20070130.0743.LDC2009T13	In a blow to the U.S. anti-drug plan, Afghan President Hamid Karzai said earlier this month he would not approve a Colombian- style spraying program to eradicate the poppies, ordering them plowed under instead.
5653	APW_ENG_20070130.0743.LDC2009T13	U.S. company DynCorp International Inc. had hoped to win a contract to carry out the spraying.
5654	APW_ENG_20070130.0743.LDC2009T13	Afghan officials said the Cabinet was concerned about the impact of herbicides on humans, legitimate crops and animals.
5655	APW_ENG_20070130.0743.LDC2009T13	The ministers also likely feared a violent backlash from rural Afghans protecting their livelihood.
5656	APW_ENG_20070130.0743.LDC2009T13	In a second blow to the U.S. plan, Ardenne said she would advise the governor of Uruzgan province to ignore Karzai's directive to destroy crops in the absence of a viable alternative.
5657	APW_ENG_20070130.0743.LDC2009T13	The Netherlands currently has around 1,900 soldiers in Afghanistan, most in the southern province of Uruzgan.
5658	APW_ENG_20070130.0743.LDC2009T13	Ardenne has just returned from a three-day visit to Dutch troops.
5659	APW_ENG_20070130.0743.LDC2009T13	Earlier this month, U.S. Ambassador to Afghanistan Ronald Neumann said the country has eradicated 1,483 acres (593 hectares) of poppies so far this year -- compared to none by the same time last year.
5660	APW_ENG_20070130.0743.LDC2009T13	Still, that's only a fraction of the 407,000 acres (162,800 hectares) of poppies that were cultivated in 2006, including 173,000 acres (69,200 hectares) in Helmand province alone, according to U.N. figures.
5661	APW_ENG_20070130.0743.LDC2009T13	Asadullah Wafa, the governor of Helmand, said he approved of Karzai's decision.
5662	APW_ENG_20070130.0743.LDC2009T13	"There is another way to eradicate, like launching operations through all the districts, and I hope the international community will give us tractors and provide more troops to destroy poppies," he said.
5663	APW_ENG_20070130.0743.LDC2009T13	Uruzgan, adjacent to Helmand in the South, produces less than 10 percent of the country's poppy crop, according to the World Bank study.
5664	APW_ENG_20070130.0743.LDC2009T13	In a December visit to Kabul, John Walters, the top U.S. anti- drug official, warned that Afghanistan could turn into a "narco- state" unless "giant steps" were made toward eliminating poppies.

5825	APW_ENG_20070202.1273.LDC2009T13	WASHINGTON 2007-02-02 16:11:09 UTC
5826	APW_ENG_20070202.1273.LDC2009T13	Democrats energized by their takeover of Congress began a campaign to do the same with the U.S. presidency on Friday in the first public gathering of all the party's White House hopefuls.
5827	APW_ENG_20070202.1273.LDC2009T13	Sen. Barack Obama began his speech to members of the Democratic National Committee with a joke about how the contest feels a little like "American Idol" or "Survivor" reality shows.
5828	APW_ENG_20070202.1273.LDC2009T13	But he quickly tried to tap into what he said is a sober mood in the United States weighed down by the Iraq war and concerns about health care and pensions.
5829	APW_ENG_20070202.1273.LDC2009T13	He spoke softly and carried the crowd with his call for an honest debate on the issues.
5830	APW_ENG_20070202.1273.LDC2009T13	"Democrats, this is not a game," Obama said.
5831	APW_ENG_20070202.1273.LDC2009T13	"This can't be about who digs up more skeletons on who, who makes the biggest slip-ups on the campaign trail.
5832	APW_ENG_20070202.1273.LDC2009T13	We owe it to the American people to do more than that.
5833	APW_ENG_20070202.1273.LDC2009T13	We owe them an election where voters are inspired."
5834	APW_ENG_20070202.1273.LDC2009T13	Obama said every candidate should pledge to provide health care for all by the end of the next president's first term.
5835	APW_ENG_20070202.1273.LDC2009T13	He also repeatedly reminded the largely anti-war crowd that he was against the Iraq invasion from the beginning and said all candidates, no matter where they stood at the start, have an obligation to bring the troops home.
5836	APW_ENG_20070202.1273.LDC2009T13	Other candidates tried to bring the crowd to its feet with sharp jabs at Bush and memorable lines.
5837	APW_ENG_20070202.1273.LDC2009T13	Sen. Chris Dodd asked for a chance to be heard in a race that includes stars Obama and New York Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton.
5838	APW_ENG_20070202.1273.LDC2009T13	He offered a rousing promise to reverse Bush's policies.
5839	APW_ENG_20070202.1273.LDC2009T13	"Get the car out of the ditch, we aren't going to take fear for an answer any more in America," Dodd said, bringing the crowd of activists to its feet.
5840	APW_ENG_20070202.1273.LDC2009T13	Dodd promised if elected he would bring troops out of Iraq, overturn Bush's torture legislation and "begin to restore America's leadership in the world."
5841	APW_ENG_20070202.1273.LDC2009T13	He said voters sent a clear message in November that they wanted change in Iraq when they elected Democratic majorities in the House and Senate, and they deserve more than the nonbinding resolution being debated in the Senate.
5842	APW_ENG_20070202.1273.LDC2009T13	"Frankly, I'm disappointed that we can't do more than send a meaningless message to the White House," Dodd said.
5843	APW_ENG_20070202.1273.LDC2009T13	"I don't think that spending a week debating a nonbinding resolution is the change that America voted for."
5844	APW_ENG_20070202.1273.LDC2009T13	Four years ago, Howard Dean ignited the crowd with a fire-and- brimstone speech in which he pointedly appealed to partisans tired of a Democratic move to the middle by declaring he was from "the Democratic wing of the Democratic party."
5845	APW_ENG_20070202.1273.LDC2009T13	Dean, now the chairman of the DNC, started the gathering by celebrating the party's reversal of fortune from minority to majority in Congress and governor's offices.
5846	APW_ENG_20070202.1273.LDC2009T13	"We are in charge again and we will really be in charge in 2008," Dean said.
5847	APW_ENG_20070202.1273.LDC2009T13	Others scheduled to speak Friday included Clinton, Wesley Clark, 2004 vice presidential nominee John Edwards and Dennis Kucinich.

5850	APW_ENG_20070204.0494.LDC2009T13	GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip 2007-02-04 13:56:26 UTC
5851	APW_ENG_20070204.0494.LDC2009T13	Hamas gunmen attacked bases of Fatah-allied troops with mortars and rocket-propelled grenades early Sunday, part of a four-day campaign by the Islamic militants to weaken the security forces loyal to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas.
5852	APW_ENG_20070204.0494.LDC2009T13	In the West Bank, a strategy session by Fatah leaders ended in a shouting match, with some participants demanding Abbas' party take a tougher stand against Hamas and others pushing to give a mediation effort by Saudi Arabia a chance.
5853	APW_ENG_20070204.0494.LDC2009T13	In one particularly angry exchange, participants threw an empty cup and a shoe at each other, witnesses said.
5854	APW_ENG_20070204.0494.LDC2009T13	Abbas and Hamas' supreme leader in exile, Khaled Mashaal, are to meet in Islam's holy city of Mecca on Tuesday for reconciliation talks hosted by Saudi King Abdullah, the highest-profile mediation effort in several weeks of fighting.
5855	APW_ENG_20070204.0494.LDC2009T13	Palestinian Prime Minister Ismail Haniyeh of Hamas also plans to attend the talks, said Ahmed Yousef, a Haniyeh aide.
5856	APW_ENG_20070204.0494.LDC2009T13	The Palestinian ambassador to Saudi Arabia, Jamal Shobaki, said the meeting will be open-ended and will focus on hammering out a platform for a national unity government and distributing Cabinet portfolios.
5857	APW_ENG_20070204.0494.LDC2009T13	More than 130 Palestinians have been killed in the factional fighting since May.
5858	APW_ENG_20070204.0494.LDC2009T13	The bloodiest round erupted Thursday, with 28 people killed and more than 230 wounded in four days.
5859	APW_ENG_20070204.0494.LDC2009T13	On Sunday, two members of Abbas' Presidential Guard died of wounds sustained in a Hamas attack on their compound Friday, hospital officials said.
5860	APW_ENG_20070204.0494.LDC2009T13	Among the dead in the weekend violence were four children.
5861	APW_ENG_20070204.0494.LDC2009T13	Also Sunday, gunmen kidnapped the nephew of Fatah strongman Mohammed Dahlan, officials said.
5862	APW_ENG_20070204.0494.LDC2009T13	Since Thursday, Hamas gunmen have attacked more than a dozen security installations in what appeared to be a systematic campaign to weaken Abbas' control of Gaza.
5863	APW_ENG_20070204.0494.LDC2009T13	Late Saturday and early Sunday, Hamas fired mortar shells and rocket-propelled grenades at a training camp of the Presidential Guard and Abbas' nearby office compound in Gaza City.
5864	APW_ENG_20070204.0494.LDC2009T13	Abbas was not in Gaza during the current round of fighting.
5865	APW_ENG_20070204.0494.LDC2009T13	On Saturday, Hamas gunmen ransacked a training camp of the Preventive Security Service in northern Gaza.
5866	APW_ENG_20070204.0494.LDC2009T13	Abbas-allied troops were holding their ground in most areas, repelling the Hamas gunmen.
5867	APW_ENG_20070204.0494.LDC2009T13	Fatah forces also attacked two Hamas- controlled ministries Saturday, and have repeatedly targeted a Hamas stronghold, Gaza City's Islamic University.
5868	APW_ENG_20070204.0494.LDC2009T13	Control over the security forces is central to the power struggle between Hamas and Fatah.
5869	APW_ENG_20070204.0494.LDC2009T13	Hamas controls the Cabinet, including the Interior Ministry, which is supposed to oversee some of the security forces.
5870	APW_ENG_20070204.0494.LDC2009T13	But Hamas lost a power struggle for control of the forces with Abbas last year and set up its own militia, the 5,600-strong Executive Force.
5871	APW_ENG_20070204.0494.LDC2009T13	Abbas, the separately elected president, said the move was illegal.
5872	APW_ENG_20070204.0494.LDC2009T13	On Saturday evening, members of Fatah's Revolutionary Council, one of the movement's decision-making bodies, met at Abbas' headquarters in the West Bank city of Ramallah to discuss strategy.
5873	APW_ENG_20070204.0494.LDC2009T13	"We all agreed that Hamas has been trying for a long time to impose its control on the Gaza Strip, and Fatah needs to stand up to this policy of Hamas," said Amin Makboul, one of the group's members.
5874	APW_ENG_20070204.0494.LDC2009T13	However, participants disagreed over tactics and whether mediation efforts were useful, he said.
5875	APW_ENG_20070204.0494.LDC2009T13	In Gaza City, bursts of gunfire alternated with periods of calm.
5876	APW_ENG_20070204.0494.LDC2009T13	Thunderous shooting shook one beachside neighborhood for more than half an hour after nightfall Saturday, as Hamas gunmen fought a local clan allied with Abbas' security forces.
5877	APW_ENG_20070204.0494.LDC2009T13	The fighting continued early Sunday, with battles in nearly a dozen locations, including the headquarters of Preventive Security in Gaza City.
5878	APW_ENG_20070204.0494.LDC2009T13	In areas not affected by the fighting, people tried to go about their lives.
5879	APW_ENG_20070204.0494.LDC2009T13	Boys played soccer in the streets, horse-drawn carts maneuvered through alleys and shoppers stocked up on supplies for the next round of battle.
5880	APW_ENG_20070204.0494.LDC2009T13	In the Sheik Radwan neighborhood, Ali Ustaz used a lull to buy a battery-powered radio so he could follow developments despite frequent power cuts.
5881	APW_ENG_20070204.0494.LDC2009T13	"There is no hope for a solution," Ustaz said, referring to an elusive power-sharing deal between Hamas and Fatah.
5882	APW_ENG_20070204.0494.LDC2009T13	In Cairo, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak said the stalled Mideast peace process depended on resolving the conflict between rival Palestinian factions as well as the release of the Israeli soldier captured by Hamas-linked militants in June.
5883	APW_ENG_20070204.0494.LDC2009T13	Speaking at a joint news conference with visiting German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Mubarak said Egypt was working to "seal the crack" between Hamas and Fatah.

5900	APW_ENG_20070205.1093.LDC2009T13	GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) -- Never mind the almost daily cease- fire announcements.
5901	APW_ENG_20070205.1093.LDC2009T13	The music played on the radio stations of Hamas and Fatah is a much better guide to war and peace.
5902	APW_ENG_20070205.1093.LDC2009T13	When both Hamas's Al Aqsa radio and Fatah's Al Shabab station played "Today is the day of rage" simultaneously a few days ago, it was pretty clear the guns would not fall silent.
5903	APW_ENG_20070205.1093.LDC2009T13	At times of heavy clashes, the playlists also include Islamic marching songs or odes to legendary Fatah founder Yasser Arafat.
5904	APW_ENG_20070205.1093.LDC2009T13	When the two sides withdraw their forces from time to time, songs about Jerusalem are popular, as a unifying theme.
5905	APW_ENG_20070205.1093.LDC2009T13	Lebanese singer Fairouz is a favorite on Al Shabab, as a demonstration of secular nationalist sentiment.
5906	APW_ENG_20070205.1093.LDC2009T13	Radio broadcasts also air political statements and take calls from listeners trapped at home.
5907	APW_ENG_20070205.1093.LDC2009T13	Trying to lower the enemy's morale, Al Shabab reported that scores of Hamas militiamen had defected.
5908	APW_ENG_20070205.1093.LDC2009T13	Al Aqsa Radio quickly retaliated with a similar report.
5909	APW_ENG_20070205.1093.LDC2009T13	When a new cease-fire was announced Sunday, both stations broadcast the same phone number for listeners to report violations to a police operations room with Hamas and Fatah observers.
5910	APW_ENG_20070205.1093.LDC2009T13	They received dozens of calls on the first day.
5911	APW_ENG_20070205.1093.LDC2009T13	And resumed playing songs of national unity.
5912	APW_ENG_20070205.1093.LDC2009T13	---
5913	APW_ENG_20070205.1093.LDC2009T13	After nightfall, thunderous gunfire frequently erupted outside a building housing visiting Associated Press staffers in Gaza City, with some of the shooting coming from a nearby building.
5914	APW_ENG_20070205.1093.LDC2009T13	It was more than just a fight between Hamas and Fatah.
5915	APW_ENG_20070205.1093.LDC2009T13	The Bakr clan, clamoring for revenge, was after the killer of a 17-year-old member, Mahmoud Bakr, who died in the crossfire last week.
5916	APW_ENG_20070205.1093.LDC2009T13	For four nights, dozens of masked Bakr men, armed and in black uniforms, pinned down a dozen Hamas gunmen -- whom they blamed for Mahmoud's death -- on a rooftop.
5917	APW_ENG_20070205.1093.LDC2009T13	The fighting is increasingly about settling personal scores, and the element of revenge will make it harder to enforce a cease- fire, even if Hamas and Fatah are to reach an elusive power- sharing agreement.
5918	APW_ENG_20070205.1093.LDC2009T13	The grieving father, Anan Bakr, a member of the Fatah-linked Preventive Security Service, said the battle has become personal.
5919	APW_ENG_20070205.1093.LDC2009T13	"In our tradition, in our religion, whoever kills must be killed, even after time passes," he said.

5921	APW_ENG_20070205.1093.LDC2009T13	An 11-year-old boy looting floor tiles from a ransacked Preventive Security Service compound in the northern town of Beit Lahiya is one of the few clear winners in the factional fighting.
5922	APW_ENG_20070205.1093.LDC2009T13	The boy, who wouldn't give his name because he is stealing government property, is selling the tiles for 1.50 shekels ($0.45, 35 European cents) a piece and has also ripped 12 window frames out of the now unguarded complex, attacked by Hamas over the weekend.
5923	APW_ENG_20070205.1093.LDC2009T13	Hamas and Fatah have fought each other to a draw after several weeks of fighting -- though the Fatah-allied security forces took a bad hit in the last four-day round that ended Sunday.
5924	APW_ENG_20070205.1093.LDC2009T13	Twenty members of the Fatah-allied security forces were killed, compared to four from Hamas and seven civilians.

5941	APW_ENG_20070208.0097.LDC2009T13	NASA said it was investigating technical problems with two instruments aboard the most powerful spacecraft ever flown to Mars.
5942	APW_ENG_20070208.0097.LDC2009T13	The problems on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter first arose in late 2006, but they worsened this year to the point where engineers have stowed away one of the instruments.
5943	APW_ENG_20070208.0097.LDC2009T13	In November, scientists operating the probe's High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment camera noticed that the image pixels were of poor quality.
5944	APW_ENG_20070208.0097.LDC2009T13	Although the problem had minimal impact on the crisp images beamed back so far, scientists fear the problem could grow worse.
5945	APW_ENG_20070208.0097.LDC2009T13	A problem also developed in an instrument that maps the temperature, ice clouds and dust in the Martian atmosphere.
5946	APW_ENG_20070208.0097.LDC2009T13	Scientists discovered the instrument, called a climate sounder, had a skewed field of view.
5947	APW_ENG_20070208.0097.LDC2009T13	The errors became more frequent last month and engineers decided to temporarily halt work with the instrument.
5948	APW_ENG_20070208.0097.LDC2009T13	The Reconnaissance Orbiter entered orbit round the Red Planet last year.
5949	APW_ENG_20070208.0097.LDC2009T13	Since November, the probe has sent back data that could fill nearly 1,000 CD-ROMS, tying the record of the Mars Global Surveyor between 1997 and 2006.

5957	APW_ENG_20070208.1268.LDC2009T13	VIENNA, Austria 2007-02-08 16:35:17 UTC
5958	APW_ENG_20070208.1268.LDC2009T13	Former Austrian ski coach Walter Mayer dropped charges against the International Olympic Committee and the World Anti-Doping Agency on Thursday, his lawyer Christian Pilz said.
5959	APW_ENG_20070208.1268.LDC2009T13	Mayer had sued WADA chairman Richard Pound and IOC president Jacques Rogge following his ban from the 2006 Turin Olympics after allegations of blood doping at the 2002 Salt Lake City Games.
5960	APW_ENG_20070208.1268.LDC2009T13	Mayer still traveled to Turin last year, but he fled Italy after police raided the living quarters of the Austrian biathlon and cross-country teams in search of banned substances and equipment.
5961	APW_ENG_20070208.1268.LDC2009T13	He ended up in a psychiatric hospital after ramming a blockade.
5962	APW_ENG_20070208.1268.LDC2009T13	"Mayer regrets that his presence at the Olympics caused such big irritations, and now he has understanding for the following statements by Pound and Rogge about him," Pilz said.
5963	APW_ENG_20070208.1268.LDC2009T13	Pound was quoted in the Austrian newspaper Die Presse in February as saying that a search of Mayer's house in the Austrian province of Styria in January divulged "equipment and instruments suitable for blood doping," Mayer's lawyer, Herwig Hasslacher, said in August.
5964	APW_ENG_20070208.1268.LDC2009T13	The hearing in the suit against Pound was scheduled for Tuesday, while the one against Rogge had been set for March 6.

5974	APW_ENG_20070215.0123.LDC2009T13	CONAKRY, Guinea 2007-02-15 00:51:26 UTC
5975	APW_ENG_20070215.0123.LDC2009T13	Soldiers fired into the air in the suburbs of Guinea's capital as the death toll from days of violent protests rose to 64 and union leaders urged renewed negotiations with the government -- but stopped short of backing off demands that the president step down.
5976	APW_ENG_20070215.0123.LDC2009T13	Rabiatou Serah Diallo, head of one of the West African country's major unions, called for negotiations with the government to recommence.
5977	APW_ENG_20070215.0123.LDC2009T13	Along with opposition politicians and other union heads, Diallo has demanded in recent days that President Lansana Conte resign from power.
5978	APW_ENG_20070215.0123.LDC2009T13	The opposition leaders and trade unions accuse Conte, the ailing leader who seized power over two decades ago in an army coup, of violating a power-sharing agreement by naming a political ally as prime minister.
5979	APW_ENG_20070215.0123.LDC2009T13	At least 64 people have been killed in Guinea since the weekend in violent protest and during martial law in the West African country, a local human rights group said Wednesday.
5980	APW_ENG_20070215.0123.LDC2009T13	Thierno Madjou Sow, president of Conakry's League of Human Rights, said the deaths since Saturday bring his group's tally to at least 120 killed since a first general strike began in mid- January.
5981	APW_ENG_20070215.0123.LDC2009T13	The weekend rioting and clashes between protesters and security forces led Conte to declare martial law Monday night, imposing a curfew for all but a few daylight hours and banning all public gatherings.
5982	APW_ENG_20070215.0123.LDC2009T13	Yet as nightfall brought the return of a curfew to the center of the capital, Conakry, children could be seen playing soccer in the street and some residents strolled down the roads.
5983	APW_ENG_20070215.0123.LDC2009T13	Much of the violence has taken place outside the city center, in suburbs and the interior of Guinea.
5984	APW_ENG_20070215.0123.LDC2009T13	Sow said his group received reports of 21 deaths from gunshot wounds in Conakry's suburbs over Tuesday and Wednesday, and another 43 deaths outside the capital.
5985	APW_ENG_20070215.0123.LDC2009T13	The violence started after Conte appointed his close ally Eugene Camara, a Cabinet member since 1997, as prime minister.
5986	APW_ENG_20070215.0123.LDC2009T13	The post had been left vacant since Conte, who seized power in a 1984 coup, fired Prime Minister Cellou Dalein Diallo in April.
5987	APW_ENG_20070215.0123.LDC2009T13	Last month, Conte agreed to appoint a consensus prime minister who was not a current member of his government in a deal to end a two-week national strike that brought Guinea to an economic standstill and sparked clashes that left at least 59 dead.
5988	APW_ENG_20070215.0123.LDC2009T13	Diallo said union leaders want to restart negotiations with the government, but have not come up with a specific plan to do so.
5989	APW_ENG_20070215.0123.LDC2009T13	"We need to meet, we need to dialogue, we need to accept each other, we need to listen to each other," Diallo told The Associated Press by telephone.
5990	APW_ENG_20070215.0123.LDC2009T13	"We need, urgently, to find ourselves around the same table."
5991	APW_ENG_20070215.0123.LDC2009T13	Diallo said the unions had been unable to meet among themselves or with colleagues since Friday, making it impossible to discuss their next steps.
5992	APW_ENG_20070215.0123.LDC2009T13	Still, Diallo said the unions were not planning to change their demands, which they say were ignored when Conte appointed Camara as prime minister.
5993	APW_ENG_20070215.0123.LDC2009T13	"We stay behind our draft agreement which must be respected," she said.
5994	APW_ENG_20070215.0123.LDC2009T13	She did not say if this meant the unions were no longer calling for Conte to resign.
5995	APW_ENG_20070215.0123.LDC2009T13	Many said Conte sidestepped the agreement by naming a confidant, and angry youths took to the streets, throwing stones and ransacking buildings.
5996	APW_ENG_20070215.0123.LDC2009T13	Security forces fired into the crowds.
5997	APW_ENG_20070215.0123.LDC2009T13	Diallo asked the international community to step in to help Guinea resolve its crisis.
5998	APW_ENG_20070215.0123.LDC2009T13	Medical officials and witnesses said at least 27 people were killed in the first three days of protests -- most of those deaths in the capital from gunshot wounds.
5999	APW_ENG_20070215.0123.LDC2009T13	The U.S. Embassy ordered all staff family members to leave Guinea and urged private U.S. citizens to go as well.
6000	APW_ENG_20070215.0123.LDC2009T13	The embassy flew out about 25 people on a U.S. government plane to Dakar, Senegal.
6001	APW_ENG_20070215.0123.LDC2009T13	The U.S. government also sent a military team of about 20 people into Guinea to beef up embassy security, according to U.S. European command.
6002	APW_ENG_20070215.0123.LDC2009T13	Conakry's airport reopened late Tuesday for an Air France flight -- the first commercial plane to fly since the fighting started Saturday.
6003	APW_ENG_20070215.0123.LDC2009T13	A crowd of more than 2,000 had gathered at the airport, and witnesses said most were clamoring to get on the flight to Paris.
6004	APW_ENG_20070215.0123.LDC2009T13	By Wednesday afternoon, the airport was nearly empty.
6005	APW_ENG_20070215.0123.LDC2009T13	Opposition leaders say the ailing president has let corruption overrun Guinea as people struggle to meet basic needs.
6006	APW_ENG_20070215.0123.LDC2009T13	Guinea's 10 million people are impoverished and many live without the most basic public services, even though the country has half the world's reserves of bauxite, used to produce aluminum.
6007	APW_ENG_20070215.0123.LDC2009T13	Conte said martial law will continue through Feb. 23.
6008	APW_ENG_20070218.0531.LDC2009T13	Israeli police commander resigns in scandal involving underworld figures
6009	APW_ENG_20070218.0531.LDC2009T13	JERUSALEM 2007-02-18 16:20:26 UTC
6010	APW_ENG_20070218.0531.LDC2009T13	Israeli police commander Moshe Karadi on Sunday resigned from his post after a government commission found he should not continue in his post because of involvement in a scandal involving underworld figures.
6011	APW_ENG_20070218.0531.LDC2009T13	Karadi announced his intention to resign at a news conference at police headquarters in Jerusalem.
6012	APW_ENG_20070218.0531.LDC2009T13	He said the government would determine when he would step down.
6013	APW_ENG_20070218.0531.LDC2009T13	Earlier Sunday, commission chairman Vardi Zeiler, a retired judge, told a news conference that Karadi must be fired for failing to ensure police thoroughly investigated the 1999 murder of a suspected crime boss and for ignoring ties between senior police officers and top organized crime figures.
6014	APW_ENG_20070218.0531.LDC2009T13	Karadi was not police commissioner at the time of the killing, but a departmental head.
6015	APW_ENG_20070218.0531.LDC2009T13	The two other members of the panel wrote in the findings that Karadi's tenure should not be extended after it expires this summer.
6016	APW_ENG_20070218.0531.LDC2009T13	The commissioner's term is three years, but the Public Security minister has an option to extend it for another year.
6017	APW_ENG_20070218.0531.LDC2009T13	Terminating Karadi's appointment would "highlight a clear norm for generations to come that someone who behaves like Karadi would be unable to complete his term as police commissioner," Zeiler told reporters.
6018	APW_ENG_20070218.0531.LDC2009T13	"If the (panel's) suspicions are correct, this is the beginning of a very corrupt police force, and the infiltration of underworld figures to the police, which corrupts the police and the regime," Zeiler added.
6019	APW_ENG_20070218.0531.LDC2009T13	Karadi insisted that the allegations against him were untrue, but said he was resigning to "set a personal example" and spare the police the harm of a scandal swirling around it.
6020	APW_ENG_20070218.0531.LDC2009T13	The Zeiler commission was formed to examine whether police properly closed the case of the murder, in which a rogue police officer confessed to shooting a suspected crime boss hospitalized under police guard after an assassination attempt.
6021	APW_ENG_20070218.0531.LDC2009T13	The officer, who said he operated at the behest of a well-known Israeli crime family, was later murdered in Mexico, allegedly by members of the crime family because of his confession.
6022	APW_ENG_20070218.0531.LDC2009T13	The case was later closed after police concluded there wasn't enough evidence.
6023	APW_ENG_20070218.0531.LDC2009T13	Karadi was a top official in southern Israel at the time of the 1999 killing, and the commission rebuked him for promoting a police commander suspected in hushing up the case on behalf of the crime family that allegedly hired the murdered officer.
6024	APW_ENG_20070218.0531.LDC2009T13	The Karadi case is just the latest in a string of scandals and controversies involving Israel's top leadership.
6025	APW_ENG_20070218.0531.LDC2009T13	Lt. Gen. Dan Halutz recently resigned as the military chief of staff after coming under withering fire for the flawed summer war against Lebanese guerrillas.

6031	APW_ENG_20070220.0689.LDC2009T13	A BP PLC-led consortium began pumping gas Tuesday from a second production well at a giant Caspian Sea field off Azerbaijan's coast less than a month after the first well was shut down for unspecified technical reasons.
6032	APW_ENG_20070220.0689.LDC2009T13	Gas from the Shah Deniz field -- one of Azerbaijan's largest -- has been keenly awaited by both Azerbaijan and neighboring Georgia, both of which have been affected by Russia's decision to increase prices sharply last year.
6033	APW_ENG_20070220.0689.LDC2009T13	The second well began pumping early Tuesday and gas from the field had already entered the pipeline system of Azerbaijan's state oil company, SOCAR, the company said in a statement.
6034	APW_ENG_20070220.0689.LDC2009T13	SOCAR holds 10 percent in the consortium developing the field.
6035	APW_ENG_20070220.0689.LDC2009T13	BP, which holds a 25.5 percent stake, has forecast output at 2.8 billion cubic meters of gas in 2007 from a planned total of four production wells.
6036	APW_ENG_20070220.0689.LDC2009T13	The consortium also includes Norway's Statoil, France's Total, Russia's Lukoil and other companies.
6037	APW_ENG_20070220.0689.LDC2009T13	Commercial production began at the field's first well in December, but was stopped a week later due to unspecified technical problems.
6038	APW_ENG_20070220.0689.LDC2009T13	The well came back onstream a month later on Jan. 14, but the company announced it had again been shut on Jan. 23.

6052	APW_ENG_20070220.1028.LDC2009T13	The company's British retail operations were hit last summer when it was forced to recall a number of its chocolate products after salmonella traces were discovered in them.
6053	APW_ENG_20070220.1028.LDC2009T13	The company said the recall had reduced revenues by between 30 million pounds and 35 million pounds (US$58.5 million and US$68.2 million
6054	APW_ENG_20070220.1028.LDC2009T13	euro44.6 million and euro51.9 million), with profit down between 5 million pounds and 10 million pounds (US$9.7 million and US$19.5 million
6055	APW_ENG_20070220.1028.LDC2009T13	euro7.4 million and euro14.9 million).
6056	APW_ENG_20070220.1028.LDC2009T13	The company also revealed it took a 15 million pound (US$29.3 million
6057	APW_ENG_20070220.1028.LDC2009T13	euro22.3 million) charge because of overstatements in income from its Nigerian operation.
6058	APW_ENG_20070220.1028.LDC2009T13	The accounting fraud was discovered in November, more than six months after Cadbury increased its stake in the operation from 46 percent to just over 50 percent.
6059	APW_ENG_20070220.1028.LDC2009T13	Cadbury shares fell 2 percent to close at 564 pence (US$11.03
6060	APW_ENG_20070220.1028.LDC2009T13	euro8.39) on the London Stock Exchange.
6061	APW_ENG_20070220.1028.LDC2009T13	Product problems continued into this year, with Cadbury earlier this months recalling a number of its Easter egg lines because they failed to carry the correct nut allergy labeling.
6062	APW_ENG_20070220.1028.LDC2009T13	But Stitzer said the company was optimistic about its prospects in 2007 and its "strong innovation pipeline" including the launch of gum brand Trident into Britain.
6063	APW_ENG_20070220.1028.LDC2009T13	Citigroup analyst Warren Ackerman said the US$4.2 billion takeover of U.S. group Adams in 2002 was paying off, giving Cadbury a powerful position in chewing gum with the Trident and Dentyne brands and in the medicated sweets market with Halls products.
6064	APW_ENG_20070220.1028.LDC2009T13	"The Adams acquisition has transformed the portfolio," Ackerman said.
6065	APW_ENG_20070220.1028.LDC2009T13	"We remain convinced that the end game is to spin off U.S. beverages to create a pure play in confectionery."
6066	APW_ENG_20070220.1028.LDC2009T13	Analysts said that Cadbury itself was likely to be the target of takeover rumors throughout the year, following reported interest from companies including Kraft Foods Inc. and Hershey Co.

6069	APW_ENG_20070220.1046.LDC2009T13	Government finalizes new laws on big-game hunting
6070	APW_ENG_20070220.1046.LDC2009T13	CAPE TOWN, South Africa 2007-02-20 17:18:16 UTC
6071	APW_ENG_20070220.1046.LDC2009T13	South Africa's environment minister on Tuesday announced a long- awaited clampdown on big-game hunting, declaring he was sickened by wealthy tourists shooting tame lions from the back of a truck and felling rhinos with a bow and arrow.
6072	APW_ENG_20070220.1046.LDC2009T13	Shrugging off threats of legal action by the hunting industry, Marthinus Van Schalkwyk said that the new law would ban "canned" hunting of big predators and rhinos in small enclosures which offered the animals no means of escape.
6073	APW_ENG_20070220.1046.LDC2009T13	Lions bred in captivity would have to be released into the open for at least two years -- rather than the six months proposed in draft regulations -- before they could be hunted to allow them to develop self-defense instincts, he said.
6074	APW_ENG_20070220.1046.LDC2009T13	"Hunting should be about a fair chase ... testing the wits of a hunter against that of the animal," he told a press conference on Table Mountain.
6075	APW_ENG_20070220.1046.LDC2009T13	"Over the years that got eroded and now we are trying to re-establish that principle."
6076	APW_ENG_20070220.1046.LDC2009T13	South Africa is famous as home to the Big Five -- lion, leopard, rhinoceros, elephant and buffalo.
6077	APW_ENG_20070220.1046.LDC2009T13	Its flagship Kruger National Park attracts hundreds of thousands of visitors every year.
6078	APW_ENG_20070220.1046.LDC2009T13	Some 9,000 privately owned game farms and other government-run reserves also offer visitors a taste of the wild.
6079	APW_ENG_20070220.1046.LDC2009T13	But it has also become a choice destination for wealthy gun- toting tourists willing to pay more than US$20,000 (euro15,200) to take home a prized "trophy" in the form of a lion or rhino's head.
6080	APW_ENG_20070220.1046.LDC2009T13	The new law, which comes into force June 1, bans the hunting of animals which have been tranquilized.
6081	APW_ENG_20070220.1046.LDC2009T13	It outlaws bows and arrows for big predators and thick skinned animals like rhinos -- one of the practices singled out by Van Schalkwyk as particularly shocking.
6082	APW_ENG_20070220.1046.LDC2009T13	And it bans the use of vehicles to chase the animal until it is too tired and terrified to flee for its life.
6083	APW_ENG_20070220.1046.LDC2009T13	"To see people who are half drunk on the back of a bakkie (truck) hunting lions which are in fact tame animals is quite abhorrent," Van Schalkwyk -- himself an avid hunter -- told The Associated Press.
6084	APW_ENG_20070220.1046.LDC2009T13	But conservationists said the law would be difficult to enforce and did not go far enough as it stopped short of an outright ban on the intensive breeding of lions, leopards and other predators.
6085	APW_ENG_20070220.1046.LDC2009T13	"The big thing for South Africa would be to stand up and say 'we are conservation leaders and this industry is immoral and unethical and we are not going to allow it,'" said Louise Joubert of the San Wildlife Trust, which campaigned for tougher regulations.
6086	APW_ENG_20070220.1046.LDC2009T13	She said it made little difference whether a lion was freed for six months or two years before being hunted because once it had got used to being reared and fed by people, it was hard to break that trust.
6087	APW_ENG_20070220.1046.LDC2009T13	Joubert said there should be an outright ban on intensive breeding projects, which often remove cubs from the mother at birth so the lioness mates more quickly, and often cull female cubs as male lions fetch a higher trophy price.
6088	APW_ENG_20070220.1046.LDC2009T13	"We have asked for an outright ban.
6089	APW_ENG_20070220.1046.LDC2009T13	If it means that four to five thousand lions have to be euthanized it would be a tragic day but it is the only way for this country to get a grip, so be it" she said.
6090	APW_ENG_20070220.1046.LDC2009T13	The South African Predator Breeders' Association, which was set up last year to lobby against the regulations, has warned that breeders may be forced to put down the estimated 3-5,000 lions they have reared if they are unable to offer them to foreign hunters and can no longer afford to feed them.
6091	APW_ENG_20070220.1046.LDC2009T13	Earlier this year, it threatened legal action against the government to claim for compensation.
6092	APW_ENG_20070220.1046.LDC2009T13	Association officials did not return phone calls asking for comment Tuesday.
6093	APW_ENG_20070220.1046.LDC2009T13	However, the Professional Hunters' Association of South Africa, whose members accompany foreign clients, said it welcomed the new regulations as a chance to clean up the image of the South African hunting industry by clamping down on lion breeders who account for only about 3 percent of game farms.
6094	APW_ENG_20070220.1046.LDC2009T13	"A small sector has given the whole industry a bad name," said Stewart Dorrington, president of the hunting body.
6095	APW_ENG_20070220.1046.LDC2009T13	An 6-7,000 foreign tourists visit South Africa each year on hunting safaris, each spending roughly US$18,000 (euro13,700), Dorrington said.
6096	APW_ENG_20070220.1046.LDC2009T13	About 55 percent of hunters are from North America and the rest from Europe and other countries.
6097	APW_ENG_20070220.1046.LDC2009T13	Van Schalkwyk said the regulations marked the start of a "clean- up of the hunting industry" and would in due course be extended to other animals like antelope species.
6098	APW_ENG_20070220.1046.LDC2009T13	Hunting is an integral part of South African life because of its cultural traditions and importance to the economy.
6099	APW_ENG_20070220.1046.LDC2009T13	"We gave our firm intention more than two years ago to deal with the issue," he said.
6100	APW_ENG_20070220.1046.LDC2009T13	"Many of the lion breeders thought they were empty threats and did not take it seriously.
6101	APW_ENG_20070220.1046.LDC2009T13	This is a practice that cannot be defended in any way," he said.

6103	APW_ENG_20070221.1497.LDC2009T13	ROME 2007-02-21 22:19:09 UTC
6104	APW_ENG_20070221.1497.LDC2009T13	Italian Premier Romano Prodi resigned Wednesday after his center- left government embarrassingly lost a Senate vote on foreign policy, including the country's military mission in Afghanistan.
6105	APW_ENG_20070221.1497.LDC2009T13	His diverse coalition -- which has been squabbling since he took office only nine months ago -- failed to close ranks and support Prodi's government, with the radical left balking at the idea of giving unquestioned backing to Italy's traditional pro-U.S. policies.
6106	APW_ENG_20070221.1497.LDC2009T13	Only a week earlier, Prodi had forbidden his Cabinet ministers from joining a march to protest the expansion of a U.S. military base in Vicenza, northern Italy.
6107	APW_ENG_20070221.1497.LDC2009T13	On Wednesday, his Green and Communist coalition partners managed to voice their objections by rejecting Prodi's entire foreign policy statement.
6108	APW_ENG_20070221.1497.LDC2009T13	Italian President Giorgio Napolitano, as head of state, asked Prodi to stay on in a caretaker role while he determines which political leaders might be able to muster enough support for a parliamentary majority -- thus avoiding the need for new elections, far ahead of their 2011 schedule.
6109	APW_ENG_20070221.1497.LDC2009T13	Prodi was smiling in the back seat of a limousine as he left the presidential palace and made no comment to reports.
6110	APW_ENG_20070221.1497.LDC2009T13	Prodi aides did not rule out the possibility that Napolitano would ask Prodi to try to form a new government, and from first discussions among some allies, support for another Prodi government seemed to be building.
6111	APW_ENG_20070221.1497.LDC2009T13	"We are ready to reconfirm our full trust in the Prodi government," said Dario Franceschini, a leader of the Olive Tree, the largest grouping in Prodi's coalition.
6112	APW_ENG_20070221.1497.LDC2009T13	"Let's hope the consultations will be useful to clear things up" and to drum up support for putting together another government.
6113	APW_ENG_20070221.1497.LDC2009T13	Napolitano planned to meet Thursday morning with the leaders in the Senate and the lower Chamber of Deputies.
6114	APW_ENG_20070221.1497.LDC2009T13	The government lost the Senate motion by two votes, despite Foreign Minister Massimo D'Alema's calling for the coalition's forces -- which range from Christian Democrats to Communists -- to support Prodi's policies, including Italy's continued mission in Afghanistan.
6115	APW_ENG_20070221.1497.LDC2009T13	The Cabinet approved a decree for continued funding of the Afghanistan mission, but without the support of three leftists in the government.
6116	APW_ENG_20070221.1497.LDC2009T13	The decree awaits parliamentary approval.
6117	APW_ENG_20070221.1497.LDC2009T13	Italy deployed 1,800 troops to join NATO's mission in Afghanistan under Prodi's predecessor, conservative leader Silvio Berlusconi.
6118	APW_ENG_20070221.1497.LDC2009T13	Prodi defeated Berlusconi in April elections to take office in May, with Italy's 61st government since the end of World War II.
6119	APW_ENG_20070221.1497.LDC2009T13	His coalition holds a comfortable margin in the lower parliamentary house, but a razor-thin edge in the Senate.
6120	APW_ENG_20070221.1497.LDC2009T13	Berlusconi had predicted Prodi's government would collapse because of the radical leftists in the coalition.
6121	APW_ENG_20070221.1497.LDC2009T13	It was not clear Wednesday if Berlusconi, who had a pacemaker implanted in December, would make another bid for power.
6122	APW_ENG_20070221.1497.LDC2009T13	A Christian Democrat opposition leader, Pier Ferdinando Casini, predicted it would be tough for Prodi to try to put together a new government.
6123	APW_ENG_20070221.1497.LDC2009T13	"He pretends not to see" his problems in mustering a majority, Casini said in an interview on state TV.
6124	APW_ENG_20070221.1497.LDC2009T13	"If he wants to go ahead, good luck," but "the country is paying the price."
6125	APW_ENG_20070221.1497.LDC2009T13	Prodi could try to reach out now to centrists in the opposition, but it was unlikely they would agree to join any government including leftists that sometimes support anti-Vatican policies.
6126	APW_ENG_20070221.1497.LDC2009T13	Prodi's government needed 160 Senate votes to win backing for its foreign policy program.
6127	APW_ENG_20070221.1497.LDC2009T13	It received just 158 votes, and 24 senators abstained -- which in the Senate is equivalent to a "no" vote.
6128	APW_ENG_20070221.1497.LDC2009T13	Prodi is an economist and former head of a now defunct Italian state industrial conglomerate who is generally pro-Vatican, although recent approval by his government for a proposed law to give some legal rights to same-sex and other unmarried couples angered the Catholic Church.
6129	APW_ENG_20070221.1497.LDC2009T13	His approval rating had dropped in recent months, after a brief tenure which saw him wage an uphill battle to liberalize Italy's economy.

6134	APW_ENG_20070222.0989.LDC2009T13	It was just the latest embarrassment for Peretz, whose popularity has plummeted in the wake of last summer's inconclusive war against Hezbollah guerrillas in Lebanon.

6136	APW_ENG_20070222.0989.LDC2009T13	The pictures show the two side by side with military binoculars held up to their eyes -- but Peretz's still have the lens caps in place.
6137	APW_ENG_20070222.0989.LDC2009T13	The photographer said Peretz raised the capped binoculars three times, nodding as Ashkenazi explained what he was "seeing."
6138	APW_ENG_20070222.0989.LDC2009T13	The Maariv daily labeled its picture, "Seeing black."

6151	APW_ENG_20070226.1011.LDC2009T13	NEW YORK 2007-02-26 16:41:49 UTC
6152	APW_ENG_20070226.1011.LDC2009T13	The Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating tax issues stemming from Citigroup's 2000 acquisition of a financing company, the largest U.S. bank said.
6153	APW_ENG_20070226.1011.LDC2009T13	Citigroup said in its annual report, filed late Friday, that the SEC's investigation involves "the treatment of certain specific tax reserves and releases during the period 2000 to 2004 related to the Associates businesses acquired in the 2000 fourth quarter."
6154	APW_ENG_20070226.1011.LDC2009T13	In September 2000, Citigroup bought Associates First Capital Corp., a financing company that is now a Citigroup subsidiary.
6155	APW_ENG_20070226.1011.LDC2009T13	Citigroup described the probe as being part of a previously disclosed investigation into the company's treatment of potential losses in Argentina in the fourth quarter of 2001.
6156	APW_ENG_20070226.1011.LDC2009T13	As Citigroup has said in previous filings, the SEC has subpoenaed witness testimony and accounting and internal-controls information from 1997 through 2004.
6157	APW_ENG_20070226.1011.LDC2009T13	Citigroup said it is cooperating with the probe but cannot predict its outcome.

6159	APW_ENG_20070226.1011.LDC2009T13	The investigation comes after Citigroup Chief Executive Charles Prince pushed for -- and declared victory in -- a companywide cleanup of Citigroup's internal controls and governance practices, following a series of run-ins with regulators around the world.

6161	APW_ENG_20070228.0075.LDC2009T13	LONDON 2007-02-28 00:29:01 UTC
6162	APW_ENG_20070228.0075.LDC2009T13	The Church of England's assembly votes Wednesday on an issue that has deeply divided the global Anglican Communion: how members should interpret Scripture on sexuality.
6163	APW_ENG_20070228.0075.LDC2009T13	Two motions, both of which regard lesbian and gay Christians, will be considered at the General Synod, the parliament of the Church of England, which is meeting this week to discuss church business.
6164	APW_ENG_20070228.0075.LDC2009T13	Neither motion, including one by a member of an evangelical group, would change church law.
6165	APW_ENG_20070228.0075.LDC2009T13	But both seek to alter the atmosphere of the debate.
6166	APW_ENG_20070228.0075.LDC2009T13	The motions were put forward early last year, but they are widely seen as a continuation of the last installment of the debate: a meeting by Anglican leaders earlier this month in Tanzania, which included Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams, spiritual leader of the Church of England and the Anglican Communion.
6167	APW_ENG_20070228.0075.LDC2009T13	The meeting ended by giving the Episcopal Church until Sept. 30 to pledge unequivocally not to consecrate another gay bishop or approve an official prayer service for blessing same-sex couples.
6168	APW_ENG_20070228.0075.LDC2009T13	If that promise is not made, the Episcopal Church could face a much reduced role in the Anglican world.
6169	APW_ENG_20070228.0075.LDC2009T13	The global Anglican Communion, including the U.S.-based Episcopalians, has 77 million members, and they have spent years debating how Scripture should be interpreted on salvation, truth and sexuality.
6170	APW_ENG_20070228.0075.LDC2009T13	In a speech to the General Synod in London on Monday, Williams said: "The public perception, as we've been reminded by several commentators in the last week or so, is that we are a church obsessed with sex."
6171	APW_ENG_20070228.0075.LDC2009T13	He said, "It feels as though we are caught in a battle very few want to be fighting."
6172	APW_ENG_20070228.0075.LDC2009T13	Williams said that debate has included complex issues such as the ordination of women as priests and same-sex relationships.
6173	APW_ENG_20070228.0075.LDC2009T13	But he said they should not be allowed to divide the Anglican Communion.
6174	APW_ENG_20070228.0075.LDC2009T13	"It is folly to think that a decision to `go our separate ways' in the communion would leave us with a neat and morally satisfying break between two groups of provinces, orthodox and heretics or humane liberals and bigots -- depending on where you stand," he said.
6175	APW_ENG_20070228.0075.LDC2009T13	"Every province could break in several different directions."
6176	APW_ENG_20070228.0075.LDC2009T13	The first motion -- put forward by the Rev. Mary Gilbert, and supported by the liberal activist group Inclusive Church Network -- asks the synod to "understand the nature of homosexual orientation, and respect the patterns of holy living to which lesbian and gay Christians aspire."
6177	APW_ENG_20070228.0075.LDC2009T13	It says the synod should "agree that a homosexual orientation in itself is no bar to a faithful Christian life."
6178	APW_ENG_20070228.0075.LDC2009T13	The second motion, by the Rev. Paul Perkin, a member of the evangelical group Reform, criticizes the Civil Partnership Act, which came into force in Britain in late 2005 and gave legal recognition to same-sex relationships and allowing gays to virtually marry.
6179	APW_ENG_20070228.0075.LDC2009T13	The motion asks the synod to express "deep concern" that the act "undermines the distinctiveness and fundamental importance to society of the relationship of marriage" and that the church's bishops have "produced a recipe for confusion by not stating clearly" that such civil partnerships would be inconsistent with Christian teaching.
6180	APW_ENG_20070228.0075.LDC2009T13	The motion also asks the bishops to investigate whether church members who have formed civil partnerships are obeying the teaching of the church, which says sexual relationships should be confined to marriage.
6181	APW_ENG_20070228.0075.LDC2009T13	In a statement two years ago, the bishops said they would not inquire into the nature of the relationship between lay people in civil partnerships, and that priests were not excluded from such bonds.

6210	APW_ENG_20070301.0788.LDC2009T13	Beginning Thursday, coach passengers can use the front lavatory on American once again after the airline restricted its use to first-class fliers.
6211	APW_ENG_20070301.0788.LDC2009T13	The change applies to domestic flights and to international flights leaving the U.S., said American spokesman John Hotard.

6214	APW_ENG_20070301.0788.LDC2009T13	The airline was the only carrier with such a rule on all flights, so it opted to change the policy, Hotard said.
6215	APW_ENG_20070301.0788.LDC2009T13	The change was announced in a memo to flight crews that was obtained by the Fort Worth Star-Telegram.

6234	APW_ENG_20070302.0701.LDC2009T13	MOSCOW 2007-03-02 12:36:00 UTC
6235	APW_ENG_20070302.0701.LDC2009T13	President Vladimir Putin said Friday that a storage facility for Russian natural gas could be built in Belgium to make it a hub for gas exports to Europe.
6236	APW_ENG_20070302.0701.LDC2009T13	Putin told visiting Belgian Prime Minister Guy Verhofstadt that Belgium's gas pipeline network linking it to other EU nations would make it a good location for a prospective natural gas storage facility.
6237	APW_ENG_20070302.0701.LDC2009T13	"We may implement a big project that would benefit not only our nations, but all of Europe: building a big gas storage facility that would allow for the shipment of gas to other nations, including Britain, using European underwater pipelines originating in Belgium,"
6238	APW_ENG_20070302.0701.LDC2009T13	He did not elaborate on details of the project in his opening remarks, which were carried by Russian state television.
6239	APW_ENG_20070302.0701.LDC2009T13	Verhofstadt, who said he visited the offices of state-controlled gas monopoly OAO Gazprom in the morning, said Belgium was ready to strengthen relations with Russian companies, Russian news agencies reported.
6240	APW_ENG_20070302.0701.LDC2009T13	He said Belgium could serve as a natural hub for gas transport and distribution, and that there were many prospects for cooperation, but did not comment specifically on the storage facility issue, according to the reports.
6241	APW_ENG_20070302.0701.LDC2009T13	Russia now supplies nearly half of Europe's gas needs, raising concern about its increasing clout, and has annoyed the European Union by refusing to ratify an energy charter that would broaden foreign access to its oil and gas deposits and export pipelines.
6242	APW_ENG_20070302.0701.LDC2009T13	But Putin has said Moscow would not ratify the charter in its current form, saying that the EU nations pushing for access to Russia's energy deposits and long-distance gas pipelines must offer assets comparable in value.
6243	APW_ENG_20070302.0701.LDC2009T13	Gazprom has pushed for access to European retail markets, sparking concern among some Europeans about its growing clout.

6246	APW_ENG_20070302.0793.LDC2009T13	VIENNA, Austria 2007-03-02 14:03:47 UTC
6247	APW_ENG_20070302.0793.LDC2009T13	Talks on the future status of Kosovo ended Friday with Serbian and ethnic Albanian negotiators "diametrically opposed" to a plan that would put the province on the road to eventual independence, a U.N. envoy said Friday.
6248	APW_ENG_20070302.0793.LDC2009T13	Martti Ahtisaari told reporters that the talks in Vienna were over, and that he had invited Serbian and Kosovo Albanian leaders to Vienna on March 10 for a final meeting before he sends the package to the U.N. Security Council, which has the final say on Kosovo's future status.
6249	APW_ENG_20070302.0793.LDC2009T13	"I have to be honest in saying that, regarding the status question, the parties remain diametrically opposed," he said.
6250	APW_ENG_20070302.0793.LDC2009T13	Ahtisaari said he would now review the points raised over the final round of talks "and see what sort of adjustments we might make."
6251	APW_ENG_20070302.0793.LDC2009T13	He did not elaborate, but Ahtisaari has made it clear in the past that he would be unlikely to make substantial changes to his 58-page draft unless both sides agreed.
6252	APW_ENG_20070302.0793.LDC2009T13	Since neither side made significant concessions, the package was likely to be delivered to the Security Council essentially as it is.
6253	APW_ENG_20070302.0793.LDC2009T13	Kosovo's deputy prime minister, Lutfi Haziri, conceded the final round produced "no movement in bringing the sides closer."
6254	APW_ENG_20070302.0793.LDC2009T13	"It was bad theater by the Serb side," Haziri told The Associated Press, adding that ethnic Albanian leaders "don't believe there will be substantial changes in the content" of the final package.
6255	APW_ENG_20070302.0793.LDC2009T13	The draft would grant greater rights and security to Kosovo's small Serbian minority while putting the province under internationally supervised self-rule and granting it trappings of statehood, such as a flag, anthem, army and constitution.
6256	APW_ENG_20070302.0793.LDC2009T13	Skender Hyseni, an ethnic Albanian representative at the talks, said the process was wearisome "because Belgrade's side came with destructive stands and made efforts to introduce a new document."
6257	APW_ENG_20070302.0793.LDC2009T13	"Their behavior was disappointing," Hyseni said.
6258	APW_ENG_20070302.0793.LDC2009T13	Serbia's foreign minister, Vuk Draskovic, said in Zagreb, Croatia, that his country would never accept the "forcible reshaping" of its internationally recognized borders.
6259	APW_ENG_20070302.0793.LDC2009T13	An independent Kosovo would cause "emotional shock and a sense of humiliation" among Serbs, and that in turn could undermine stability in the Balkans, Draskovic warned.
6260	APW_ENG_20070302.0793.LDC2009T13	Kosovo has been under international administration since 1999, when NATO airstrikes on Belgrade ended a brutal Serbian crackdown on ethnic Albanian separatists in the province.
6261	APW_ENG_20070302.0793.LDC2009T13	About 16,000 NATO-led peacekeepers still patrol the region.
6262	APW_ENG_20070302.0793.LDC2009T13	The hardening of positions amid a continuing stalemate raised new questions about how the international community will reconcile ethnic Albanians' quest for independence with Serbia's refusal to grant the province anything even remotely resembling statehood.
6263	APW_ENG_20070302.0793.LDC2009T13	Neither side is happy with the U.N. plan.
6264	APW_ENG_20070302.0793.LDC2009T13	Serbs insist that Kosovo -- the heart of their ancient homeland -- should remain part of their republic.
6265	APW_ENG_20070302.0793.LDC2009T13	And many ethnic Albanians feel the plan grants too many concessions to the Serbian minority while falling short of establishing the province as a fully independent state.
6266	APW_ENG_20070302.0793.LDC2009T13	"Just as expected, there was no agreement" in the final round, said Leon Kojen, who co-led the Serbian team.
6267	APW_ENG_20070302.0793.LDC2009T13	He said Serbia expected to get a "new version" of Ahtisaari's proposal next week.
6268	APW_ENG_20070302.0793.LDC2009T13	Ahtisaari's deputy, Austrian diplomat Albert Rohan, said that despite the deadlock on the key question of whether Kosovo should be put on the road to statehood or remain part of Serbian territory, the talks were "extremely useful because the parties talked directly."
6269	APW_ENG_20070302.0793.LDC2009T13	"These talks have presented an opportunity" to close gaps on other issues, said Ahtisaari, a former Finnish president who has mediated in conflicts in Asia and Africa.
6270	APW_ENG_20070302.0793.LDC2009T13	The plan could lead to a Security Council showdown between the United States, which backs Kosovo's independence, and Russia, a traditional Serbian ally.
6271	APW_ENG_20070302.0793.LDC2009T13	However, Russian officials recently have suggested that Moscow might simply abstain from a vote on the package rather than use its veto power to block it.

6279	APW_ENG_20070303.0613.LDC2009T13	Afghanistan's foreign minister told members of Parliament on Saturday that Pakistan uses terror as its foreign policy and that it once occupied almost 90 percent of Afghanistan, a reference to when the Taliban ruled the country.
6280	APW_ENG_20070303.0613.LDC2009T13	Foreign Minister Rangeen Dadfar Spanta said the international community was rewarding Pakistan with aid packages even though it supports Taliban fighters.
6281	APW_ENG_20070303.0613.LDC2009T13	"Pakistan shouldn't use terror as its foreign policy," he said.
6282	APW_ENG_20070303.0613.LDC2009T13	"I wish that the international community wouldn't give rewards to countries that are supporting the Taliban."
6283	APW_ENG_20070303.0613.LDC2009T13	Afghan officials frequently accuse Pakistani leaders of harboring Taliban fighters and commanders, though Pakistan's government insists it does all it can to fight terrorism.
6284	APW_ENG_20070303.0613.LDC2009T13	Pakistani intelligence officials say one of the Taliban's top leaders -- Mullah Obaidullah Akhund -- was arrested in Quetta on Monday, the highest-ranking Afghan militant to be captured since the fall of the hardline regime in 2001.
6285	APW_ENG_20070303.0613.LDC2009T13	The arrest -- yet to be formally announced by Pakistan's government -- came on the same day U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney made a visit to Islamabad to express concern over al-Qaida regrouping along the border and a feared Taliban spring offensive in Afghanistan.
6286	APW_ENG_20070303.0613.LDC2009T13	Spanta gave the frank assessment of Pakistan to members of the upper house's foreign relations committee.
6287	APW_ENG_20070303.0613.LDC2009T13	At one point Spanta said the conversation was "between you and me," an indication he may have thought he was speaking off the record.
6288	APW_ENG_20070303.0613.LDC2009T13	However, several Afghan media members were recording the conversation and later broadcast the comments.
6289	APW_ENG_20070303.0613.LDC2009T13	Davood Muradian, a senior adviser to Spanta, said there was "nothing new" in Spanta's comments.
6290	APW_ENG_20070303.0613.LDC2009T13	He said there are some "circles in Pakistan" that don't want to see Afghanistan and Pakistan coexist peacefully.
6291	APW_ENG_20070303.0613.LDC2009T13	"But we want a good relationship with all our neighbors, including Pakistan," Muradian said.
6292	APW_ENG_20070303.0613.LDC2009T13	"We want Pakistan to recognize Afghanistan as an independent country."
6293	APW_ENG_20070303.0613.LDC2009T13	Spanta, who is an ethnic Tajik, said Pakistan once occupied "90 percent of our soil, but they were not satisfied" a reference to when Taliban fighters, who are mostly ethnic Pashtun, ruled most of Afghanistan from 1996-2001.

6302	APW_ENG_20070306.0867.LDC2009T13	MOGADISHU, Somalia 2007-03-06 13:01:37 UTC
6303	APW_ENG_20070306.0867.LDC2009T13	Mortars slammed into Mogadishu's airport Tuesday during a ceremony welcoming the arrival of peacekeepers.
6304	APW_ENG_20070306.0867.LDC2009T13	A policeman who was at the scene said one person was wounded.
6305	APW_ENG_20070306.0867.LDC2009T13	An Associated Press reporter said gunmen launched eight mortars, but only two struck the airport.
6306	APW_ENG_20070306.0867.LDC2009T13	People at the airport scattered immediately at the sound of the first blast.
6307	APW_ENG_20070306.0867.LDC2009T13	Somalia's deputy defense minister, Salad Ali Jelle, refused to comment, saying officials were investigating.
6308	APW_ENG_20070306.0867.LDC2009T13	The attack came as Ugandan peacekeepers arrived in Somalia's capital to protect the still-struggling transitional government and to allow for the withdrawal of Ethiopian troops who helped the government topple an Islamic militia.
6309	APW_ENG_20070306.0867.LDC2009T13	The mortars were the latest example of the volatility the peacekeepers face in a country that has seen little but anarchy for years.
6310	APW_ENG_20070306.0867.LDC2009T13	Late Monday, unidentified gunmen killed seven people, including a police commander and a leading cleric, government officials and witnesses said.
6311	APW_ENG_20070306.0867.LDC2009T13	And a World Food Program ship that was hijacked off the country's lawless coast on Feb. 25 was still being held by pirates Tuesday.
6312	APW_ENG_20070306.0867.LDC2009T13	The Ugandan troops are the vanguard of a larger African Union force authorized by the United Nations to help the government assert its authority.
6313	APW_ENG_20070306.0867.LDC2009T13	Ethiopian troops entered Somalia in late December, when an Islamic movement threatened to attack the government.
6314	APW_ENG_20070306.0867.LDC2009T13	Two cargo aircraft carrying soldiers and armored vehicles touched down at Mogadishu's main airport in the center of the city early Tuesday and were welcomed by top government officials.
6315	APW_ENG_20070306.0867.LDC2009T13	Paddy Akunda, the Ugandan forces' spokesman, said 400 troops were on the ground so far in Mogadishu, with the remaining 1,100 expected in the next 24 hours.
6316	APW_ENG_20070306.0867.LDC2009T13	"We are very happy to be the first African Union peacekeepers to Somalia.
6317	APW_ENG_20070306.0867.LDC2009T13	We are welcomed here," Akunda said during the ceremony.
6318	APW_ENG_20070306.0867.LDC2009T13	"We are not imposing anything on Somalis.
6319	APW_ENG_20070306.0867.LDC2009T13	We know our mandate
6320	APW_ENG_20070306.0867.LDC2009T13	we will work toward restoring law and order in Somalia without targeting anybody."
6321	APW_ENG_20070306.0867.LDC2009T13	Residents were not allowed inside the airport during the welcoming ceremony for security reasons, Jelle said.
6322	APW_ENG_20070306.0867.LDC2009T13	Ethiopian and Somali troops have beefed up security in the capital.
6323	APW_ENG_20070306.0867.LDC2009T13	In Uganda, Deputy Defense Minister Ruth Nankabirwa said the troops understand the dangers of working in Somalia.
6324	APW_ENG_20070306.0867.LDC2009T13	"We have not just dropped our troops there without knowing the situation," she said.
6325	APW_ENG_20070306.0867.LDC2009T13	"We will be the first people to make sure that they are safe so they can carry on to other missions."
6326	APW_ENG_20070306.0867.LDC2009T13	Insurgents, believed to be the remnants of the Islamic movement that tried to seize power last year, have staged almost daily attacks against people associated with the government, its armed forces or the Ethiopian military.
6327	APW_ENG_20070306.0867.LDC2009T13	A police commander and another officer were ambushed late Monday at a major intersection in the center of Mogadishu and two bystanders were wounded in the fire fight, Mohamud Burale Coon, a shop owner, said.
6328	APW_ENG_20070306.0867.LDC2009T13	Maslah Mohamed Abdi said his brother, who was the top cleric in one of Mogadishu's main mosques, was killed outside his home.
6329	APW_ENG_20070306.0867.LDC2009T13	The same gunmen then killed four businessmen who were chewing qat, a mild stimulant, in their home, a neighbor said.
6330	APW_ENG_20070306.0867.LDC2009T13	"The men stood at the door of a room ... and then opened fire," Halima Hashi Adow said.
6331	APW_ENG_20070306.0867.LDC2009T13	The cleric and the four men had been trying to hire gunmen to protect them, their homes and their neighborhood.
6332	APW_ENG_20070306.0867.LDC2009T13	But the insurgents use the neighborhood to launch mortar attacks on Ethiopian bases and did not want any private security forces in the area, residents said.
6333	APW_ENG_20070306.0867.LDC2009T13	African Union Peace and Security Commissioner Said Djinnit said the peacekeepers are allowed to defend themselves if attacked, but would not launch attacks on anyone.
6334	APW_ENG_20070306.0867.LDC2009T13	"Our mission is to support all Somalis and the political process, which is based on dialogue and reconciliation," Djinnit told journalists in the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa.
6335	APW_ENG_20070306.0867.LDC2009T13	A Somali government spokesman, meanwhile, said local police are prepared to fight the insurgency and crime wave.
6336	APW_ENG_20070306.0867.LDC2009T13	"Security is paramount for the country to attain a lasting peace, and law enforcement mechanisms such as the prisons and police force are now ready," Hussein Mohamud Hussein, the spokesman, said.

6340	APW_ENG_20070306.0977.LDC2009T13	MILAN, Italy 2007-03-06 13:58:27 UTC
6341	APW_ENG_20070306.0977.LDC2009T13	High-end eyewear maker Luxottica SpA plans to invest euro300 million (US$395 million) in its business this year, with at least euro225 million (US$296 million) earmarked for expanding its retail network, CEO Andrea Guerra told analysts on Tuesday.
6342	APW_ENG_20070306.0977.LDC2009T13	Luxottica forecast that 2007 earnings per share would rise by as much as 17 percent, pushed by demand for eyewear that it makes through licensing agreements with fashion houses including Versace and Chanel.
6343	APW_ENG_20070306.0977.LDC2009T13	In forecasts released the day after it unveiled a 12 percent rise in fourth-quarter net profit, Luxottica said it is targeting earnings per share of between euro1.07 and euro1.09 (US$1.41 and US$1.44) this year, up from fully diluted earnings per share of euro0.93 (US$1.22) last year.
6344	APW_ENG_20070306.0977.LDC2009T13	The Milan-based company also said it expects revenue to grow by up to 6.8 percent in 2007, targeting full-year revenue of euro4.9 billion to euro5 billion (US$6.4 billion to US$ 6.5 billion) compared with euro4.7 billion (US$6.2 billion) in 2006.
6345	APW_ENG_20070306.0977.LDC2009T13	While the targets represent significant growth, they indicate slowing growth compared with 2006.
6346	APW_ENG_20070306.0977.LDC2009T13	Luxottica also said it expects revenue from its wholesale operations -- supplying eyewear to third-party retailers -- to climb about 15 percent in 2007.
6347	APW_ENG_20070306.0977.LDC2009T13	In 2006, revenue from wholesale operations grew 31 percent to euro1.7 billion (US$2.2 billion).

6349	APW_ENG_20070306.1508.LDC2009T13	LONDON 2007-03-06 19:01:22 UTC
6350	APW_ENG_20070306.1508.LDC2009T13	The brown cloak worn by Obi Wan Kenobi in the "Star Wars" trilogy -- and then forgotten for years in a warehouse -- was among 400 costumes sold Tuesday at a major auction of movie and television memorabilia.
6351	APW_ENG_20070306.1508.LDC2009T13	It sold for 54,000 pounds (US$104,000
6352	APW_ENG_20070306.1508.LDC2009T13	euro79,000) to an anonymous telephone bidder.
6353	APW_ENG_20070306.1508.LDC2009T13	Audience members raised their paddles in rapid succession as costumes flashed across television screens at Bonhams, a British auctioneer, as staff fielded telephone bids from all over the world.
6354	APW_ENG_20070306.1508.LDC2009T13	When the hammer dropped over a Bond girl's cat-suit or Anthony Hopkins' army uniform, men in dark blazers whispered the prices into their cell phones.
6355	APW_ENG_20070306.1508.LDC2009T13	"It's nerve-racking, of course it is," costume collector Kamran Raja said as the outfits from "Evita" were auctioned off.
6356	APW_ENG_20070306.1508.LDC2009T13	He made a bid, paying 2,700 pounds (US$5,200
6357	APW_ENG_20070306.1508.LDC2009T13	euro4,000) to add a fur- lined dressing gown from the movie to his 40-piece collection, which he said included one of Madonna's bras.
6358	APW_ENG_20070306.1508.LDC2009T13	"I just aged 20 years in two minutes," he said.
6359	APW_ENG_20070306.1508.LDC2009T13	Some of the more eye-catching costumes -- including William Wallace's (Mel Gibson's) kilt from "Braveheart" and James Bond's dinner jacket from "Thunderball," were modeled by Bonhams staff.
6360	APW_ENG_20070306.1508.LDC2009T13	Sean Connery's stand-in grinned mischievously as the audience made its bids, while a blonde Supergirl, dressed in a blue elastic leotard and red knee-high boots, struggled to keep a straight face as the audience competed for her costume.
6361	APW_ENG_20070306.1508.LDC2009T13	While most of the bidders were dealers or collectors, a few were looking for a cheap conversation piece from a famous film or actor, Bonhams specialist Stephanie Connell said.
6362	APW_ENG_20070306.1508.LDC2009T13	"You might just wear a suit to a dinner party and say, 'Look, it's a Michael Caine suit.'"
6363	APW_ENG_20070306.1508.LDC2009T13	But she said the big ticket items, like the Bond dinner jacket -- which sold for 33,600 pounds (US$64,700
6364	APW_ENG_20070306.1508.LDC2009T13	euro49,400) -- would probably see never see another martini again.
6365	APW_ENG_20070306.1508.LDC2009T13	The costumes came from Angels The Costumiers, whose chairman Tim Angel said was trying to cut insurance costs by selling some of the outfits from its 1.5 million-strong collection.
6366	APW_ENG_20070306.1508.LDC2009T13	The auction's main attraction, the hooded cloak worn by Alec Guinness in "Star Wars" had lain unnoticed in the company's inventory -- and rented out for costume parties -- until its provenance was discovered last year.
6367	APW_ENG_20070306.1508.LDC2009T13	"How would anyone have known when that film was made that it would attain cult status?"
6368	APW_ENG_20070306.1508.LDC2009T13	Angel said.
6369	APW_ENG_20070306.1508.LDC2009T13	Among the items the company did keep track of was the beaten metal helmet worn by Sir Bedevere (Terry Jones) in "Monty Python and the Holy Grail."
6370	APW_ENG_20070306.1508.LDC2009T13	It sold for 10,000 pounds (US$19,300
6371	APW_ENG_20070306.1508.LDC2009T13	euro14,700) -- 20 times more than its pre-sale estimate.
6372	APW_ENG_20070306.1508.LDC2009T13	Raja, the pop costume collector, was mystified.
6373	APW_ENG_20070306.1508.LDC2009T13	"It's just a metal bucket," he said, shaking his head.

6380	APW_ENG_20070309.0499.LDC2009T13	The Oscar-nominated Canadian film "Water" opened in India on Friday, seven years after angry Hindu nationalists disrupted filming of the movie, which they said made Hindus look bad.
6381	APW_ENG_20070309.0499.LDC2009T13	Theater owners in Mumbai, India's entertainment capital, said the first showings of the movie were fully booked and they did not forsee any trouble.
6382	APW_ENG_20070309.0499.LDC2009T13	"We are booked for the next few days," said a Manoj Patil, a manager at Premiere, a popular Mumbai cinema hall.
6383	APW_ENG_20070309.0499.LDC2009T13	"We have not made any special security arrangements."
6384	APW_ENG_20070309.0499.LDC2009T13	Hindu nationalists stormed the sets of Water in 2000 when director Deepa Mehta, who lives in Toronto, was filming in Varanasi, Hinduism's holiest city.
6385	APW_ENG_20070309.0499.LDC2009T13	The production did not get back on track until she resumed shooting four years later in Sri Lanka.
6386	APW_ENG_20070309.0499.LDC2009T13	Traditional Hindus consider widows to be bad luck, and the movie, set in India of the 1930s, centers on a home where widows are sent by their families to live among each other, isolated from their families and the larger society.
6387	APW_ENG_20070309.0499.LDC2009T13	The movie features actors John Abraham, Seema Biswas and Lisa Ray and was nominated this year for an Academy Award in the foreign language film category.
6388	APW_ENG_20070309.0499.LDC2009T13	It was first screened in 2005 at the Toronto Film Festival and opened in the United States in April 2006.
6389	APW_ENG_20070309.0509.LDC2009T13	In new charges, Israeli group says troops used Palestinian civilians as human shields
6390	APW_ENG_20070309.0509.LDC2009T13	JERUSALEM 2007-03-09 08:27:49 UTC
6391	APW_ENG_20070309.0509.LDC2009T13	The Israeli army said Friday that it was looking into new allegations that troops used Palestinians as human shields during an operation in the West Bank city of Nablus.
6392	APW_ENG_20070309.0509.LDC2009T13	The Israeli human rights group B'Tselem charged that while conducting a major operation against Palestinian gunmen in the city last week, troops took two minors -- a 15-year-old boy and an 11-year old girl -- along while they searched houses for militants and weapons, forcing them to enter the houses first.
6393	APW_ENG_20070309.0509.LDC2009T13	The use of civilians in military operations has been ruled illegal by Israel's Supreme Court and is prohibited by military orders.
6394	APW_ENG_20070309.0509.LDC2009T13	The army said Friday that it was checking the new charges.
6395	APW_ENG_20070309.0509.LDC2009T13	The first indication that troops used Palestinians as human shields in the Nablus operation came when an Associated Press Television camera captured what appeared to be such a scene on Feb. 25.
6396	APW_ENG_20070309.0509.LDC2009T13	The footage shows Sameh Amira, 24, accompanying troops as they enter apartments in the city's casbah, or Old City.
6397	APW_ENG_20070309.0509.LDC2009T13	The army promised a "thorough inquiry" into that incident.
6398	APW_ENG_20070309.0509.LDC2009T13	Amira's cousin, 15-year-old Amid Amira, told B'Tselem field workers that soldiers took him at the same time as they took Sameh.
6399	APW_ENG_20070309.0509.LDC2009T13	They forced him to come along as they searched three houses, he said, making him enter rooms first, empty cupboards and open windows.
6400	APW_ENG_20070309.0509.LDC2009T13	Jihan Dadush, 11, told B'Tselem that soldiers took her from her home three days later, on Feb. 28, forcing her to open the door of a neighboring apartment and enter ahead of them.
6401	APW_ENG_20070309.0509.LDC2009T13	The soldiers then took her home, she said.
6402	APW_ENG_20070309.0509.LDC2009T13	Until 2005, soldiers employed a tactic of making civilians knock on their neighbors' doors to warn them of an impending raid, claiming this protected bystanders by spurring militants to surrender peacefully.
6403	APW_ENG_20070309.0509.LDC2009T13	But in a landmark 2005 ruling, the Israeli Supreme Court ruled the tactic illegal and barred any use of civilians in military operations.
6404	APW_ENG_20070309.0509.LDC2009T13	B'Tselem spokeswoman Sarit Michaeli urged the army to open a military police investigation into the Nablus incidents.
6405	APW_ENG_20070309.0509.LDC2009T13	"The army must investigate what happened and act accordingly -- try people, make sure the rules are clarified and understand where the failures were, in order to prevent this from happening again," she said.
6406	APW_ENG_20070309.0509.LDC2009T13	In August 2002, a 19-year-old Palestinian student, Nidal Daraghmeh, was killed when troops in the West Bank town of Tubas forced him to knock on the door of a neighboring building where a Hamas fugitive was hiding.

6443	APW_ENG_20070314.1411.LDC2009T13	Australian cyclist Robbie McEwen pulled off a strategic maneuver to win the opening stage of the weeklong Tirreno-Adriatico race Wednesday.
6444	APW_ENG_20070314.1411.LDC2009T13	As the group was preparing for a mass sprint, McEwen tucked in behind Lotto teammate Fred Rodriguez, who was leading the group.
6445	APW_ENG_20070314.1411.LDC2009T13	Just as the racers were approaching the last two turns on the course, with 400 meters (yards) to go, McEwen broke away.
6446	APW_ENG_20070314.1411.LDC2009T13	Rodriguez stopped pedaling when McEwen passed him and slowed down the opponents behind him.
6447	APW_ENG_20070314.1411.LDC2009T13	The rest of the pack couldn't close the gap around the turns and, by the time the road straightened out, McEwen had built a 50-meter (yard) lead and cruised across the finish line.
6448	APW_ENG_20070314.1411.LDC2009T13	McEwen won the 175-kilometer (109-mile) stage, which began and ended in Civitavecchia, in 4 hours, 38 minutes, 24 seconds.

6460	APW_ENG_20070315.0606.LDC2009T13	The rival Hamas and Fatah movements put the final touches on a Palestinian unity government Thursday, but Israel quickly condemned the coalition as a "step backward" and said it would try to rally international opposition to it.
6461	APW_ENG_20070315.0606.LDC2009T13	The Palestinian factions hope their alliance will end bloody internal fighting and lead the Palestinian government out of international isolation.
6462	APW_ENG_20070315.0606.LDC2009T13	But the Israeli reaction signaled trouble for the unity plan.
6463	APW_ENG_20070315.0606.LDC2009T13	Western countries have said they are waiting for the new government to take office before deciding whether to lift their economic sanctions against the Palestinian government.
6464	APW_ENG_20070315.0606.LDC2009T13	Hamas and Fatah leaders wrapped up months of tortuous coalition talks late Wednesday, saying they would present their coalition to parliament for approval on Saturday.
6465	APW_ENG_20070315.0606.LDC2009T13	On Thursday, Prime Minister Ismail Haniyeh of Hamas was to present the list of Cabinet ministers to President Mahmoud Abbas.
6466	APW_ENG_20070315.0606.LDC2009T13	"Today is an occasion to celebrate.
6467	APW_ENG_20070315.0606.LDC2009T13	We have done everything," Haniyeh said late Wednesday, after a late-night meeting with President Mahmoud Abbas of Fatah.
6468	APW_ENG_20070315.0606.LDC2009T13	Haniyeh and Abbas agreed to the power-sharing deal last month in Saudi Arabia, but had spent the past few weeks ironing out the final details.
6469	APW_ENG_20070315.0606.LDC2009T13	Clearing the final obstacle, the men agreed on the appointment of a new interior minister, a sensitive post that oversees several powerful security forces.
6470	APW_ENG_20070315.0606.LDC2009T13	Officials identified the new minister as Hani Kawasmi, a senior Interior Ministry civil servant who has good relations with Hamas and Fatah, but does not belong to either party.
6471	APW_ENG_20070315.0606.LDC2009T13	Mustafa Barghouti, the incoming information minister, confirmed the appointment.
6472	APW_ENG_20070315.0606.LDC2009T13	Barghouti said other key appointments included Salam Fayyad, an internationally respected economist, as finance minister, and Ziad Abu Amr, an independent lawmaker, as foreign minister.
6473	APW_ENG_20070315.0606.LDC2009T13	Haniyeh will remain as prime minister, and Azzam al-Ahmed, head of Fatah's parliament bloc, will be deputy prime minister.
6474	APW_ENG_20070315.0606.LDC2009T13	Haniyeh planned to formally announce the Cabinet on Thursday.
6475	APW_ENG_20070315.0606.LDC2009T13	In all, Hamas will get nine Cabinet posts and Fatah will get six.
6476	APW_ENG_20070315.0606.LDC2009T13	Israel and the Quartet of Mideast peace makers -- the U.S., EU, U.N. and Russia -- have said Hamas must renounce violence, recognize Israel's right to exist and accept past peace agreements.
6477	APW_ENG_20070315.0606.LDC2009T13	The government platform, posted on Hamas and Fatah web sites, includes only a vague pledge to "respect" past peace deals, falling short of explicit recognition of Israel.
6478	APW_ENG_20070315.0606.LDC2009T13	The government program also affirms the Palestinians' right to resist and "defend themselves against any Israeli aggression."
6479	APW_ENG_20070315.0606.LDC2009T13	At the same time, the platform calls for maintaining and expanding a truce with Israel.
6480	APW_ENG_20070315.0606.LDC2009T13	While many in the West consider "resistance" to be a code word for violent attacks, the Palestinians have a much vaguer definition, including anything from armed attacks to street protests.
6481	APW_ENG_20070315.0606.LDC2009T13	In the first Israeli reaction to the deal, a senior Israeli government official on Thursday called it a "step backward" for peace prospects.
6482	APW_ENG_20070315.0606.LDC2009T13	The official who spoke on condition of anonymity pending a formal Israeli announcement said Israel would try to rally international opposition to the government.
6483	APW_ENG_20070315.0606.LDC2009T13	Palestinian officials urged the international community to give the government a chance, despite misgivings about Hamas.
6484	APW_ENG_20070315.0606.LDC2009T13	Israel, the U.S, and European Union consider the Islamic militant group, which has killed scored of Israelis in suicide bombings, a terrorist group.

6486	APW_ENG_20070315.0606.LDC2009T13	The incoming deputy prime minister, Azzam al-Ahmed, said he hoped the Arab world and the European Union would try to "pressure the U.S. and Israel to change their position" against the new coalition.
6487	APW_ENG_20070315.0606.LDC2009T13	Hamas trounced the more moderate Fatah in parliamentary elections last year, giving it control over most government functions.
6488	APW_ENG_20070315.0606.LDC2009T13	But the Hamas-led government was crippled by Western sanctions imposed over its refusal to recognize Israel's right to exist.
6489	APW_ENG_20070315.0606.LDC2009T13	Abbas, who was elected separately in 2005, has been pushing Hamas since last autumn to join Fatah in a more moderate coalition in hopes of lifting the Western boycott.
6490	APW_ENG_20070315.0606.LDC2009T13	The negotiations collapsed repeatedly, often sparking rounds of deadly factional fighting in Gaza.
6491	APW_ENG_20070315.0606.LDC2009T13	As negotiations continued, there was an exchange of fire between Hamas and Fatah forces in the northern Gaza Strip.
6492	APW_ENG_20070315.0606.LDC2009T13	Security officials said nine people, including five bystanders, were slightly wounded in the shootout.

6494	APW_ENG_20070315.0606.LDC2009T13	On Thursday, a Fatah activist died of wounds he sustained the previous night in a shootout with Hamas gunmen in the northern Gaza Strip, Palestinian security officials said.
6495	APW_ENG_20070315.0606.LDC2009T13	Fears of bloodshed led Abbas to agree to the power-sharing deal at talks in Saudi Arabia last month, even though the agreement falls short of the international demands to renounce violence, recognize Israel and accept past peace agreements.
6496	APW_ENG_20070315.0606.LDC2009T13	Abbas has told Western powers that the deal -- which includes a vague pledge to "respect" past agreements with Israel -- is the best he could get from the militant group.

6501	APW_ENG_20070316.1536.LDC2009T13	Long-struggling steelmaker Wheeling-Pittsburgh Corp. posted an expected fourth-quarter loss Friday, announcing a hit of $18.1 million (euro13.58 million).
6502	APW_ENG_20070316.1536.LDC2009T13	That translates to a loss of $1.20 (euro.90) per share for the period ending Dec. 31, 2006, compared with a net loss of $23.4 million (euro17.56 million), or $1.61 (euro1.21), in the same period the previous year.
6503	APW_ENG_20070316.1536.LDC2009T13	Net sales totaled $332.3 million (euro249.38 million) on 431,325 tons of steel products shipped for the quarter, compared with $356 million (euro267.17 million) on 527,336 tons of steel shipped in the same period the previous year.
6504	APW_ENG_20070316.1536.LDC2009T13	The average selling price per ton was $770 (euro577.86), compared with $675 (euro506.57) per ton the year before.
6505	APW_ENG_20070316.1536.LDC2009T13	For the year, Wheeling-Pitt reported a profit of $6.5 million (euro4.88 million), or 44 cents per share, compared with a year- end loss of $33.8 million (euro25.37 million), or $2.37 (euro1.78) per share, in 2005.
6506	APW_ENG_20070316.1536.LDC2009T13	Investors began bracing for the losses last fall, when privately held Illinois steel distributor Esmark Inc. seized control of the company in a proxy fight.
6507	APW_ENG_20070316.1536.LDC2009T13	Almost immediately, Esmark executives warned it would take until spring -- at least through the first quarter -- to turn around deep financial problems for the company that had twice survived bankruptcy but struggled to turn a profit.
6508	APW_ENG_20070316.1536.LDC2009T13	"We are in the infancy stage of the first chapter of our turnaround," said James Bouchard, chairman of Wheeling-Pitt's board and chief executive of Esmark.
6509	APW_ENG_20070316.1536.LDC2009T13	Wheeling-Pitt shares fell 45 cents, or 1.84 percent, to close at $24.06 (euro18.06) on the Nasdaq Stock Market.
6510	APW_ENG_20070316.1536.LDC2009T13	To try to soften the bad news, Wheeling-Pitt announced it will end its reliance on a $250 million (euro187.62 million) federally guaranteed loan on April 1, 2008, nine years earlier than expected, by refinancing the balance.
6511	APW_ENG_20070316.1536.LDC2009T13	An initial payment of $37.5 million (euro28.14 million) will be made Monday on the balance of $187.4 million (euro140.64 million), said Craig Bouchard, president of both Esmark and the Wheeling-Pitt board of directors.
6512	APW_ENG_20070316.1536.LDC2009T13	The rest would be refinanced after Esmark and Wheeling-Pitt formally complete their previously announced merger.
6513	APW_ENG_20070316.1536.LDC2009T13	Both boards have already approved plans for the new publicly traded company, which will be called Esmark Inc., but shareholders also must vote.
6514	APW_ENG_20070316.1536.LDC2009T13	The Bouchards said Friday they hope to complete the merger by June.
6515	APW_ENG_20070316.1536.LDC2009T13	The company also announced Friday it has offered voluntary early retirement packages to management employees, with severance packages depending on experience.
6516	APW_ENG_20070316.1536.LDC2009T13	It described the buyout plan as "fair and equitable" and said it helps the company balance the size of the management ranks with the union-covered work force.
6517	APW_ENG_20070316.1536.LDC2009T13	"We need to reduce management and overhead to run leaner and meaner," Craig Bouchard said.

6525	APW_ENG_20070317.0293.LDC2009T13	The new Hamas-Fatah coalition was to set to clear a final formal hurdle Saturday, approval by the parliament, before taking on the challenge of persuading a skeptical world to end a crippling year-long boycott of the Palestinian government.
6526	APW_ENG_20070317.0293.LDC2009T13	The government's program, finalized late Friday, contained some softer language than a draft published earlier in the week, though is still falls short of international demands for acceptance, including explicit recognition of Israel and renunciation of violence.
6527	APW_ENG_20070317.0293.LDC2009T13	Prime Minister Ismail Haniyeh of Hamas was to present the platform at the start of the parliament session, to be held simultaneously in Gaza City and in Ramallah, with a video link.

6530	APW_ENG_20070317.0293.LDC2009T13	According to the program, the coalition's main goal will be to set up a Palestinian state in lands Israel occupied in the 1967 Mideast War, said incoming Information Minister Mustafa Barghouti, an independent.
6531	APW_ENG_20070317.0293.LDC2009T13	The government "respects" previous international agreements reached by the PLO and calls for peace talks to be conducted by moderate Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas of Fatah.
6532	APW_ENG_20070317.0293.LDC2009T13	Any future deal could be submitted to a national referendum, suggesting that the Islamic militant Hamas will not be given veto power.
6533	APW_ENG_20070317.0293.LDC2009T13	The program calls for expanding a cease-fire with Israel, yet also "affirms resistance in all its forms, expecially non-violent resistance to occupation."
6534	APW_ENG_20070317.0293.LDC2009T13	The reference to resistance was part of the draft, in an apparent nod to Hamas, while the phrase "non- violent" was introduced later.

6537	APW_ENG_20070317.0293.LDC2009T13	It should provide a powerful base for ending the embargo on the Palestinian Authority," he said.
6538	APW_ENG_20070317.0293.LDC2009T13	Later Saturday, Abbas is to swear in the coalition, formed after months of stop-and-go negotiations interrupted by periods of deadly factional fighting that claimed more than 140 lives.
6539	APW_ENG_20070317.0293.LDC2009T13	Brushing aside international misgivings about Fatah joining forces with Hamas, Abbas has said it's the only way to avert a civil war in the West Bank and Gaza.
6540	APW_ENG_20070317.0293.LDC2009T13	Israel announced earlier this week, reacting to the draft program published on web sites, that it would not deal with the new government.

6549	APW_ENG_20070317.0293.LDC2009T13	The U.S. was more subdued.
6550	APW_ENG_20070317.0293.LDC2009T13	White House spokesman Tony Snow, saying he did not want to express disappointment, indicated Thursday that there would be no change in the U.S. administration's refusal to deal with the Palestinian government unless its platform changed.
6551	APW_ENG_20070317.0293.LDC2009T13	"Our position has been consistent, which is, you need a Palestinian government that is going to, in fact, abide by the Quartet conditions," Snow said.
6552	APW_ENG_20070317.0293.LDC2009T13	However, Barghouti said Saturday that the Palestinians have received positive signs from Europe that the the boycott might be eased.

6554	APW_ENG_20070319.0883.LDC2009T13	NEW YORK 2007-03-19 15:31:25 UTC
6555	APW_ENG_20070319.0883.LDC2009T13	Three police officers surrendered Monday to face charges in the fatal shooting of an unarmed black man on his wedding day, an incident that stirred outrage around New York City.
6556	APW_ENG_20070319.0883.LDC2009T13	The officers were accused of firing nearly 50 shots at three young men in a car outside a nightclub, killing Sean Bell and seriously wounding two of his friends.
6557	APW_ENG_20070319.0883.LDC2009T13	Two other officers involved were not indicted.
6558	APW_ENG_20070319.0883.LDC2009T13	The eight-count indictment charges detectives Michael Oliver, who fired 31 times, and Gerard Isnora, a decorated undercover officer who fired 11 shots, with first-degree and second-degree manslaughter, Queens District Attorney Richard Brown said Monday.
6559	APW_ENG_20070319.0883.LDC2009T13	Those charges are classified as violent felonies with mandated jail time if the men are convicted.
6560	APW_ENG_20070319.0883.LDC2009T13	The maximum punishment for manslaughter is 25 years, Brown said.
6561	APW_ENG_20070319.0883.LDC2009T13	Detective Marc Cooper, who fired four shots, faces a misdemeanor endangerment charge, Brown said.
6562	APW_ENG_20070319.0883.LDC2009T13	The shooting led to accusations of racism against the NYPD.
6563	APW_ENG_20070319.0883.LDC2009T13	Bell was black, as are the other victims
6564	APW_ENG_20070319.0883.LDC2009T13	three of the officers are black, and two are white.
6565	APW_ENG_20070319.0883.LDC2009T13	Arraignment was set for Monday afternoon.
6566	APW_ENG_20070319.0883.LDC2009T13	"This grand jury acted in the most responsible and conscientious fashion," said Brown.
6567	APW_ENG_20070319.0883.LDC2009T13	"This was a case that was, I'm sure, not easy for them to resolve."
6568	APW_ENG_20070319.0883.LDC2009T13	Grand jurors declined to indict on the more serious counts of second-degree murder, and attempted murder, or the lesser charge of criminally negligent homicide.
6569	APW_ENG_20070319.0883.LDC2009T13	"We are a long way from a conviction," said defense attorney Philip Karasyk, who represents Isnora.
6570	APW_ENG_20070319.0883.LDC2009T13	Bell was killed Nov. 25 as he left his bachelor party.
6571	APW_ENG_20070319.0883.LDC2009T13	Police have said the officers were involved in an undercover investigation at the nightclub when they overheard a conversation that convinced them the men were going to their car to retrieve a gun.
6572	APW_ENG_20070319.0883.LDC2009T13	They have said that Bell's car hit the unmarked police vehicle and that the officers believed someone in Bell's car was reaching for a gun when they opened fire.
6573	APW_ENG_20070319.0883.LDC2009T13	No gun was found.
6574	APW_ENG_20070320.0207.LDC2009T13	Egyptian parliament approves controversial amendments to constitution
6575	APW_ENG_20070320.0207.LDC2009T13	CAIRO, Egypt 2007-03-20 03:41:03 UTC
6576	APW_ENG_20070320.0207.LDC2009T13	Egypt's parliament approved a controversial set of amendments to the constitution that the opposition has denounced as a blow to democracy in this top U.S. ally in the Mideast.
6577	APW_ENG_20070320.0207.LDC2009T13	President Hosni Mubarak has billed the changes Monday as part of a reform package aimed at increasing democracy in the country he has ruled unchallenged for a quarter century.
6578	APW_ENG_20070320.0207.LDC2009T13	But the opposition has said the changes will restrict judicial supervision of elections they call vital to preventing vote fraud.
6579	APW_ENG_20070320.0207.LDC2009T13	The amendments also write permanently into the constitution strong security powers for the president they fear will be abused.
6580	APW_ENG_20070320.0207.LDC2009T13	The changes come at a time that the U.S. has reduced public pressure on Egypt to bring greater democracy.
6581	APW_ENG_20070320.0207.LDC2009T13	Two years ago, the Bush administration made reform in Egypt a top priority, but more recently it has spoken out less often, more concerned with winning Cairo's support in the Mideast's numerous crises, including Iraq, Lebanon and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
6582	APW_ENG_20070320.0207.LDC2009T13	Many critics see the changes as aimed at preserving the 78-year- old Mubarak's control and smoothing the way for his son Gamal to succeed him in a future election.
6583	APW_ENG_20070320.0207.LDC2009T13	Opponents also believe the amendments aim to ward off any election challenge from the Muslim Brotherhood, an Islamic fundamentalist group and the biggest opposition bloc in the legislature.
6584	APW_ENG_20070320.0207.LDC2009T13	The 454-seat parliament voted on the measures in a late evening session, a day earlier than expected, after hours of discussion.
6585	APW_ENG_20070320.0207.LDC2009T13	"With our blood and souls we sacrifice ourselves for you, Mubarak," the ruling party lawmakers chanted before the results of the vote were announced.
6586	APW_ENG_20070320.0207.LDC2009T13	A spokesman for the Muslim Brotherhood accused the government of passing the measures "in the night, like thieves."
6587	APW_ENG_20070320.0207.LDC2009T13	"There is a strange and worrisome insistence on passing the amendments as quickly as possible, which reveals the extent of the conspiracy against the people," Hamdi Hassan told The Associated Press."
6588	APW_ENG_20070320.0207.LDC2009T13	The 34 amendments passed with a vote of 315 in favor, parliament speaker Fathi Sorour said on Egyptian television.
6589	APW_ENG_20070320.0207.LDC2009T13	The amendments will now be put before a popular referendum, expected in late March or early April.
6590	APW_ENG_20070320.0207.LDC2009T13	Sorour did not announce the "no" votes in the session.
6591	APW_ENG_20070320.0207.LDC2009T13	The Brotherhood's Hassan said 113 lawmakers voted against the amendments, including two members of the ruling National Democratic Party.
6592	APW_ENG_20070320.0207.LDC2009T13	Abdel-Halim Qandil, a leader of the pro-reform Kifaya movement, said the government was "rushing to commit a political crime.
6593	APW_ENG_20070320.0207.LDC2009T13	... They are using the constitution like a tissue paper."
6594	APW_ENG_20070320.0207.LDC2009T13	"They are moving on to a greater crime, the son inheriting power from the father," he said.
6595	APW_ENG_20070320.0207.LDC2009T13	One amendment bans the formation of any political party based on religion, ensuring the Brotherhood -- which is banned -- cannot become a party.
6596	APW_ENG_20070320.0207.LDC2009T13	Another amendment would require any candidate for president to come from a recognized political party holding at least 3 percent of the seats in parliament.
6597	APW_ENG_20070320.0207.LDC2009T13	Brotherhood candidates run as independents in elections.
6598	APW_ENG_20070320.0207.LDC2009T13	The group scored a surprise victory in parliamentary elections in 2005, winning about a fifth of the seats.
6599	APW_ENG_20070320.0207.LDC2009T13	The opposition was also angered by a change that would create an independent commission to monitor elections, a step they say will reduce the role of judges in overseeing the vote.
6600	APW_ENG_20070320.0207.LDC2009T13	During the 2005 elections, pro-reform judges blew the whistle on vote fraud that plagued the balloting.
6601	APW_ENG_20070320.0207.LDC2009T13	Another amendment would replace emergency laws in place since the 1981 assassination of President Anwar Sadat, which give police wide powers to detain people and curb political activity.
6602	APW_ENG_20070320.0207.LDC2009T13	Under the new proposed amendment, the constitution would empower the president to refer "any terrorist crime to any of the judiciary authorities stated in the constitution or the law."
6603	APW_ENG_20070320.0207.LDC2009T13	Opponents say that means the president can refer suspects to military courts, which have been widely used in the past but are sharply criticized by rights groups since their rulings cannot be appealed.
6604	APW_ENG_20070320.0207.LDC2009T13	The London-based rights group Amnesty International said the proposed reforms, particularly the anti-terrorism statute, will lead to the "greatest erosion of rights in 26 years."
6605	APW_ENG_20070320.0207.LDC2009T13	Foreign Minister Ahmed Aboul Gheit bluntly rejected the criticism, saying outsiders don't have the right to "even express their opinion" on Egypt's constitution.

6607	APW_ENG_20070322.1346.LDC2009T13	LIMA, Peru 2007-03-22 18:41:58 UTC
6608	APW_ENG_20070322.1346.LDC2009T13	An extremely rare species of owl discovered in 1976, and known only from a few specimens caught in nets after dark, has been seen in the wild for the first time, the American Bird Conservancy said Thursday.
6609	APW_ENG_20070322.1346.LDC2009T13	The long-whiskered owlet, one of the world's smallest owls, was spotted in February by researchers monitoring a private conservation area in Peru's northern jungle.
6610	APW_ENG_20070322.1346.LDC2009T13	The conservancy said that the sighting "is considered a holy grail of South American ornithology."
6611	APW_ENG_20070322.1346.LDC2009T13	Photos provided by the conservancy show a bright-eyed bird not much bigger than the fist of the person holding it.
6612	APW_ENG_20070322.1346.LDC2009T13	It is so distinct that it has been named in its own genus, "Xenoglaux," meaning "strange owl," due to the long wispy feathers or whiskers that stream out from its wild-looking reddish-orange eyes.
6613	APW_ENG_20070322.1346.LDC2009T13	The owl inhabits the dense undergrowth of highland forests in a remote region of Peru.
6614	APW_ENG_20070322.1346.LDC2009T13	"Seeing the long-whiskered owlet is a huge thrill," said David Geale of Asociacion Ecosistemas Andinos, who was a member of the research team.
6615	APW_ENG_20070322.1346.LDC2009T13	"Its population is estimated to be less than 1,000 birds and possibly as few as 250."
6616	APW_ENG_20070322.1346.LDC2009T13	He said the species is endangered by the rapid destruction of its forest habitat and its small range.
6617	APW_ENG_20070322.1346.LDC2009T13	The conservancy said in a news release that investigators encountered the owlet three times during daylight hours and recorded its calls frequently at night.
6618	APW_ENG_20070322.1346.LDC2009T13	The researchers captured a bird in a mist-net and later released it onto a tree branch, where it was photographed before disappearing into the night.

6675	APW_ENG_20070327.0685.LDC2009T13	Philippine cardinal calls for an end to political killings -- by military and rebels
6676	APW_ENG_20070327.0685.LDC2009T13	MANILA, Philippines 2007-03-27 11:44:51 UTC
6677	APW_ENG_20070327.0685.LDC2009T13	All political killings are bad, whether perpetrated by government troops or communist rebels, an influential Roman Catholic cardinal in the Philippines said in reports published Tuesday.
6678	APW_ENG_20070327.0685.LDC2009T13	The comments by the archbishop of Manila, Cardinal Gaudencio Rosales, come in the wake of accusations by left-wing and human rights groups blaming the Philippine military for the killing, abduction and torture of hundreds of political activists since President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo came to power in 2001.
6679	APW_ENG_20070327.0685.LDC2009T13	"We should tell the government as well as the rebels that it is wrong to kill," Rosales said in comments published in major newspapers Tuesday.
6680	APW_ENG_20070327.0685.LDC2009T13	"It is not one-sided.
6681	APW_ENG_20070327.0685.LDC2009T13	It is both sides."
6682	APW_ENG_20070327.0685.LDC2009T13	Presidential spokesman Ignacio Bunye said the cardinal's words were "fair."
6683	APW_ENG_20070327.0685.LDC2009T13	Arroyo's government denies supporting abuses against political activists, and insists it is taking action to stop them.
6684	APW_ENG_20070327.0685.LDC2009T13	It has appealed for help from the European Union with forensic investigations.
6685	APW_ENG_20070327.0685.LDC2009T13	Bunye said the government would also welcome the participation of the U.N. human rights commission and the U.S. government "in the fight versus wrong and the quest for impartial justice."
6686	APW_ENG_20070327.0685.LDC2009T13	Military officials say they are investigating the alleged involvement of some soldiers in the killings, but blame most on communist guerrillas who they say are conducting an internal purge.
6687	APW_ENG_20070327.0685.LDC2009T13	"The government should be told (not to kill anyone), and that's what we are doing," Rosales said.
6688	APW_ENG_20070327.0685.LDC2009T13	"To our brothers in the mountains, it is also wrong to kill," he said, referring to the communist rebels.
6689	APW_ENG_20070327.0685.LDC2009T13	"They also kill.
6690	APW_ENG_20070327.0685.LDC2009T13	Sorry for saying that, (but) it comes to the same thing.
6691	APW_ENG_20070327.0685.LDC2009T13	That's equally wrong."
6692	APW_ENG_20070327.0685.LDC2009T13	While acknowledging the situation in the Philippines is alarming, Rosales dismissed claims by some leftist groups that it was as bad as 1972-1981, when late dictator Ferdinand Marcos imposed martial law, and thousands were killed, imprisoned and tortured and basic rights suppressed.
6693	APW_ENG_20070327.0685.LDC2009T13	"What's going on now is nothing as compared to martial law," he said.
6694	APW_ENG_20070327.0685.LDC2009T13	In a statement, Communist Party spokesman Gregorio Rosal called Rosales' comments "gravely unfortunate," and said they belittled the gravity of the situation.
6695	APW_ENG_20070327.0685.LDC2009T13	He said the current government's human rights record is "not far" from that of the Marcos administration.
6696	APW_ENG_20070327.0685.LDC2009T13	Local human rights group Karapatan has reported more than 800 people, mostly left-wing activists and human rights workers, have been killed and about 200 others have disappeared.
6697	APW_ENG_20070327.0685.LDC2009T13	It alleged the government has adopted a counterinsurgency plan targeting not only communist guerrillas but civilian groups perceived by the military to be part of the rebel network.
6698	APW_ENG_20070327.0685.LDC2009T13	The rebels have been fighting for a Maoist state for 38 years and are included on U.S. and European list of terrorist organizations.
6699	APW_ENG_20070327.0939.LDC2009T13	Indonesia agrees to start sharing bird flu virus samples with WHO
6700	APW_ENG_20070327.0939.LDC2009T13	JAKARTA, Indonesia 2007-03-27 14:41:00 UTC
6701	APW_ENG_20070327.0939.LDC2009T13	Indonesia will resume sending bird flu virus specimens to the World Health Organization immediately, the health minister said Tuesday, ending a four-month standoff health officials feared could potentially put the entire world at risk.
6702	APW_ENG_20070327.0939.LDC2009T13	Health Minister Siti Fadiliah Supari had earlier refused to share samples with the global body, saying she was afraid they would be used to develop vaccines that would be ultimately unaffordable for poor nations in the event of a pandemic.
6703	APW_ENG_20070327.0939.LDC2009T13	International scientists argued that, without specimens, they could not monitor the virus that has killed 66 people in Indonesia -- a third of the world's total -- to see if it was mutating into a more dangerous form.
6704	APW_ENG_20070327.0939.LDC2009T13	"We will start sending bird flu samples to the World Health Organization immediately," Supari told reporters after receiving assurances from the global body that viruses would only be given to pharmaceutical companies with Indonesia's consent.
6705	APW_ENG_20070327.0939.LDC2009T13	"Now we have the right to directly face the companies to negotiate to get what we want," the health minister said.
6706	APW_ENG_20070327.0939.LDC2009T13	"We trust WHO will not violate our trust, because this is related to the WHO's credibility."
6707	APW_ENG_20070327.0939.LDC2009T13	The unexpected announcement came on the second day of talks in the capital Jakarta between Supari, top WHO officials, regional health chiefs and international avian influenza experts.
6708	APW_ENG_20070327.0939.LDC2009T13	The meeting wraps up Wednesday.
6709	APW_ENG_20070327.0939.LDC2009T13	"We will keep those viruses and not share them with any industry," David Heymann, the WHO's top flu official, said at a joint press conference.
6710	APW_ENG_20070327.0939.LDC2009T13	"There will be a mechanism to determine how that is done in a transparent way."
6711	APW_ENG_20070327.0939.LDC2009T13	For weeks, Supari has been demanding that the global body change its 50-year-old virus sharing system, in which it collects regular flu samples from all over the world and makes them available to vaccine makers and others.
6712	APW_ENG_20070327.0939.LDC2009T13	"These practices keep developing countries poor and sick," Supari said Tuesday night.
6713	APW_ENG_20070327.0939.LDC2009T13	"The system is more dangerous than bird flu itself."
6714	APW_ENG_20070327.0939.LDC2009T13	Indonesia's decision to withhold the virus had received support from some other developing nations.
6715	APW_ENG_20070327.0939.LDC2009T13	Heymann earlier said Supari's demands would hinder research into the virus and jeopardize public safety.
6716	APW_ENG_20070327.0939.LDC2009T13	"If we don't know what's going on, it's dangerous, and here is where the virus is most affecting humans," he told reporters late Monday, adding that vaccine makers are already looking elsewhere for virus samples.
6717	APW_ENG_20070327.0939.LDC2009T13	"They will use other viruses, and it will leave Indonesia in great risk," he said.
6718	APW_ENG_20070327.0939.LDC2009T13	"And it will leave other countries in great risk."
6719	APW_ENG_20070327.0939.LDC2009T13	Heymann suggested several ways to ensure a fairer distribution of vaccines, among them, creating stockpiles of vaccines for use in poor countries and transferring technology so they can produce their own.
6720	APW_ENG_20070327.0939.LDC2009T13	To ensure it has access to a bird flu vaccine, Indonesia has reached a tentative agreement with U.S. drug manufacturer Baxter Healthcare Corp.
6721	APW_ENG_20070327.0939.LDC2009T13	Under the deal, Indonesia would provide samples of the virus in exchange for Baxter's expertise in vaccine production.
6722	APW_ENG_20070327.0939.LDC2009T13	Indonesia would stockpile the vaccine for use in case there is a major human outbreak.
6723	APW_ENG_20070327.0939.LDC2009T13	Bird flu has killed at least 169 people since it began ravaging Asian poultry stocks in 2003, according to WHO.
6724	APW_ENG_20070327.0939.LDC2009T13	It remains hard for people to catch, and most human cases have been linked to contact with sick birds.
6725	APW_ENG_20070327.0939.LDC2009T13	But experts fear it could mutate into a form that spreads easily among people, potentially sparking a pandemic that could kill millions.
6726	APW_ENG_20070327.0939.LDC2009T13	Indonesia, the world's fourth-most-populous country, is seen as a potential hotspot because of its high density of people and chickens.
6727	APW_ENG_20070327.0939.LDC2009T13	Currently, only up to about 500 million doses of flu vaccine can be produced annually -- far short of what would be needed in a pandemic.

6729	APW_ENG_20070328.1248.LDC2009T13	TEHRAN, Iran 2007-03-28 17:27:16 UTC
6730	APW_ENG_20070328.1248.LDC2009T13	Iran broadcast the first pictures Wednesday of the 15 British sailors and marines it seized last week, including a female captive who wore a white tunic and a black head scarf and said the British boats had "trespassed" in Iranian waters.
6731	APW_ENG_20070328.1248.LDC2009T13	Britain immediately protested the airing of the footage, calling it "completely unacceptable for these pictures to be shown on television."
6732	APW_ENG_20070328.1248.LDC2009T13	Earlier in the day, Britain had announced it was freezing all contacts with Iran apart from negotiations to free the sailors.
6733	APW_ENG_20070328.1248.LDC2009T13	The 15 have been caught in the middle of a tense dispute between the two governments about whether the sailors were operating in Iraqi waters when they were captured Friday, as Britain says, or whether they had illegally entered Iranian waters, as Iran says.
6734	APW_ENG_20070328.1248.LDC2009T13	In the footage aired by Al-Alam, an Arabic-language, Iranian state-run television station, British sailor Faye Turney contradicts her government's claim that the team had not entered Iranian waters.
6735	APW_ENG_20070328.1248.LDC2009T13	"Obviously we trespassed into their waters," Turney, 26, says on the video.
6736	APW_ENG_20070328.1248.LDC2009T13	"They were very friendly and very hospitable, very thoughtful, nice people.
6737	APW_ENG_20070328.1248.LDC2009T13	They explained to us why we've been arrested, there was no harm, no aggression," she said.
6738	APW_ENG_20070328.1248.LDC2009T13	Turney, sitting in a room with a floral background, was also shown in uniform eating with sailors and marines and at one point was shown smoking a cigarette with eyes downcast.
6739	APW_ENG_20070328.1248.LDC2009T13	British officials declined to comment on whether showing the video footage of the sailors and marines violated the Geneva Conventions, which prohibit countries from putting captured military personnel on display.
6740	APW_ENG_20070328.1248.LDC2009T13	The chief spokesman for the International Committee of the Red Cross also declined to comment, saying the ICRC was not involved in the situation.
6741	APW_ENG_20070328.1248.LDC2009T13	The video footage included a brief scene of what appeared to be the British sailors sitting in an Iranian boat in open waters immediately after their capture.
6742	APW_ENG_20070328.1248.LDC2009T13	At one point, a handwritten letter from Turney is shown.
6743	APW_ENG_20070328.1248.LDC2009T13	In it, Turney writes, "I have written a letter to the Iranian people to apologize for us entering their waters."
6744	APW_ENG_20070328.1248.LDC2009T13	Turney was the only person to be shown speaking in the video.
6745	APW_ENG_20070328.1248.LDC2009T13	Iranian Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki, speaking during an Arab leaders summit meeting in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, had said that Turney -- the only female crew member -- could be released later on Wednesday or on Thursday.
6746	APW_ENG_20070328.1248.LDC2009T13	Prime Minister Tony Blair called the capture of the 15 Royal Navy crew "unacceptable, wrong and illegal."
6747	APW_ENG_20070328.1248.LDC2009T13	He told the House of Commons Wednesday that it was "now time to ratchet up the international and diplomatic pressure" on Tehran.
6748	APW_ENG_20070328.1248.LDC2009T13	That included the release by the British Defense Ministry Wednesday of GPS coordinates it said proved the 15 were in Iraqi waters when they were arrested -- about 1.7 nautical miles inside Iraqi waters on the Shatt al-Arab waterway.
6749	APW_ENG_20070328.1248.LDC2009T13	The ministry also said the Iranians had made inconsistent designations of the location where the incident occurred.
6750	APW_ENG_20070328.1248.LDC2009T13	In a first act of retribution against Tehran, Foreign Secretary Margaret Beckett suspended bilateral talks with Tehran on all other issues.
6751	APW_ENG_20070328.1248.LDC2009T13	Visits by officials were stopped, issuing visas to Iranian officials suspended and British support for events such as trade missions put on hold, her office said.
6752	APW_ENG_20070328.1248.LDC2009T13	President Bush spoke to British Prime Minister Tony Blair over a secured video conference call about the standoff Wednesday.
6753	APW_ENG_20070328.1248.LDC2009T13	"The president fully backs Tony Blair and our allies in Britain," she said.
6754	APW_ENG_20070328.1248.LDC2009T13	Oil prices rose by more than US$1 a barrel Wednesday as the sailor standoff continued and on rumors that Iran had fired a missile at a U.S. ship in the Persian Gulf.

6757	APW_ENG_20070402.0585.LDC2009T13	Ukraine ' s president discusses possible dissolution of parliament with faction leaders
6758	APW_ENG_20070402.0585.LDC2009T13	KIEV, Ukraine 2007-04-02 12:08:04 UTC
6759	APW_ENG_20070402.0585.LDC2009T13	Ukraine's President Viktor Yushchenko convened parliamentary faction leaders on Monday to present a stark choice: stop trying to expand the majority coalition by poaching pro-presidential lawmakers or face the dissolution of parliament.
6760	APW_ENG_20070402.0585.LDC2009T13	The meeting was seen as an effort to find a way out of the escalating political crisis, but it also could lay the groundwork for Yushchenko to sign the dissolution order.
6761	APW_ENG_20070402.0585.LDC2009T13	Under Ukraine's constitution, Yushchenko must first meet with the parliamentary speaker and faction leaders before signing the order to disband the legislature.
6762	APW_ENG_20070402.0585.LDC2009T13	Yushchenko has accused Premier Viktor Yanukovych of trying to usurp power by unconstitutionally expanding his majority in parliament and has warned the premier that he must back down.
6763	APW_ENG_20070402.0585.LDC2009T13	Yanukovych has said he seeks compromise, but will not bow to any ultimatums.
6764	APW_ENG_20070402.0585.LDC2009T13	The stakes are high for the nation of 47 million and for Yushchenko, who is under enormous pressure from all sides.
6765	APW_ENG_20070402.0585.LDC2009T13	Yushchenko's former Orange Revolution allies held a major rally in the capital Saturday, urging him to dissolve parliament.
6766	APW_ENG_20070402.0585.LDC2009T13	Opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko warned that protesters could stage a replay of Orange Revolution protests and "we won't disperse until the president signs the order" to disband the legislature.
6767	APW_ENG_20070402.0585.LDC2009T13	Meanwhile, Yanukovych's backers began laying the ground work for a competing tent camp near the parliament building to pressure the president not to dissolve the 450-seat house.
6768	APW_ENG_20070402.0585.LDC2009T13	"It's extremely dangerous today to escalate the conflict ... to increase emotional pressure on voters and politicians," said Raysa Bohatyrova, leader of Yanukovych's party faction in parliament.
6769	APW_ENG_20070402.0585.LDC2009T13	She said that if Yushchenko signs an order to disband parliament, lawmakers were ready to immediately appeal to the Constitutional Court to rule on its legality.
6770	APW_ENG_20070402.0585.LDC2009T13	The standoff between Yushchenko and Yanukovych arose after 11 lawmakers allied with the president defected to Yanukovych's coalition last month, in violation of the constitution, which says the coalition can be expanded only by the addition of entire factions, not individual lawmakers.
6771	APW_ENG_20070402.0585.LDC2009T13	Yushchenko also wants a new law that compels local lawmakers to remain with the party they belonged to during the election to also be applied to parliamentary lawmakers.
6772	APW_ENG_20070402.0585.LDC2009T13	Yanukovych now has the support of 260 lawmakers in the 450-seat house, and his party has suggested they will soon reach 300 -- enough to overturn presidential vetoes and make changes to the constitution.
6773	APW_ENG_20070402.0585.LDC2009T13	Yushchenko came to power after hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians flooded onto Independence Square to protest Yanukovych's fraud-marred presidential victory in 2004.
6774	APW_ENG_20070402.0585.LDC2009T13	The Supreme Court overturned Yanukovych's victory and called new elections, which Yushchenko won.
6775	APW_ENG_20070402.0585.LDC2009T13	Yanukovych rebounded in last year's parliamentary elections, capitalizing on widespread disappointment in the slow pace of reforms and divisions between the Orange Revolution team.
6776	APW_ENG_20070402.0585.LDC2009T13	Yanukovych's party put together a majority coalition, and Yanukovych returned as premier.
6777	APW_ENG_20070402.0585.LDC2009T13	The two rivals started feuding almost immediately, and Yanukovych has increasingly moved to sideline the president.

6918	APW_ENG_20070404.0831.LDC2009T13	Democrat Barack Obama raked in $25 million (euro18.7 million) for his presidential bid in the first three months of 2007, placing him on a par with front-runner Hillary Rodham Clinton and dashing her image as the party's inevitable nominee.
6919	APW_ENG_20070404.0831.LDC2009T13	The eye-popping figure was the latest evidence that Obama, a political newcomer who has served just two years in the Senate, has emerged as the most powerful new force in presidential politics this year.

6933	APW_ENG_20070407.0266.LDC2009T13	An Israeli helicopter launched an airstrike along the Gaza Strip's border with Israel early Saturday, officials said, killing a Palestinian militant and wounding two others and further straining a fragile cease-fire.
6934	APW_ENG_20070407.0266.LDC2009T13	In the West Bank, meanwhile, Israeli troops clashed with Palestinian gunmen, wounding one of the area's most wanted and best-known militants.
6935	APW_ENG_20070407.0266.LDC2009T13	Zakariye Zubeidi, a leader of the Al Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades, was moderately wounded in the shoulder, the group said.
6936	APW_ENG_20070407.0266.LDC2009T13	The army said it carried out Saturday's airstrike, near the Jebaliya refugee camp in northern Gaza, after spotting the militants trying to plant a bomb.
6937	APW_ENG_20070407.0266.LDC2009T13	It said militants had planted explosives in the same area two days earlier.
6938	APW_ENG_20070407.0266.LDC2009T13	The Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine, a small militant group, said the militants were "on a holy mission" when they were hit by the Israeli force.
6939	APW_ENG_20070407.0266.LDC2009T13	In a joint statement with the Islamic Jihad militant group, the DFLP said the dead militant, 22, blew himself up in an attempt to cause casualties among Israeli ground troops.
6940	APW_ENG_20070407.0266.LDC2009T13	However, Palestinian medical officials said the nature of the man's wounds indicated the airstrike was the cause of death.
6941	APW_ENG_20070407.0266.LDC2009T13	The incident was the latest blow to the truce, reached last November between Israel and Palestinian militants in Gaza.
6942	APW_ENG_20070407.0266.LDC2009T13	Israel says militants have been exploiting the lull to smuggle explosives, missiles and other weapons into Gaza through tunnels from neighboring Egypt.
6943	APW_ENG_20070407.0266.LDC2009T13	During the truce, militants also have continued to fire rockets into Israel.
6944	APW_ENG_20070407.0266.LDC2009T13	On Wednesday, a Palestinian gunman was killed in an exchange of fire with Israeli troops in an area where militants frequently fire rockets toward Israel.
6945	APW_ENG_20070407.0266.LDC2009T13	The army said militants have planted more than 40 bombs along the border since the cease-fire declaration.
6946	APW_ENG_20070407.0266.LDC2009T13	Israeli military officials have repeatedly warned of the arms buildup in Gaza in recent weeks, and the army has been preparing for a large-scale invasion.
6947	APW_ENG_20070407.0266.LDC2009T13	Prime Minister Ehud Olmert has so far refused to authorize such an operation.
6948	APW_ENG_20070407.0266.LDC2009T13	But his defense minister, Amir Peretz, has given the green light for limited operations along the border to halt rocket launchers, bombings or infiltrations.
6949	APW_ENG_20070407.0266.LDC2009T13	Israel withdrew from Gaza, ending a 38-year occupation, in September 2005.
6950	APW_ENG_20070407.0266.LDC2009T13	Also Saturday, the Al Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades, a militant group linked to President Mahmoud Abbas' Fatah party, said Zubeydi was shot in the shoulder during a gunbattle with Israeli forces in the northern West Bank city of Jenin.

6957	APW_ENG_20070409.0043.LDC2009T13	Roadside bombs in southern Afghanistan killed seven NATO soldiers, officials said, as militants struck back during the the alliance's biggest anti-Taliban offensive in the world's most fertile opium-producing region.
6958	APW_ENG_20070409.0043.LDC2009T13	Separately, a purported spokesman for the Taliban said the kidnapped translator for an Italian journalist was beheaded Sunday.
6959	APW_ENG_20070409.0043.LDC2009T13	The Afghan government confirmed the death.
6960	APW_ENG_20070409.0043.LDC2009T13	Six troops died and one was injured when one of the roadside bombs struck their vehicle, the alliance said in a statement.
6961	APW_ENG_20070409.0043.LDC2009T13	Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper confirmed they were Canadian troops, Canadian Press reported.
6962	APW_ENG_20070409.0043.LDC2009T13	A separate roadside bomb Sunday killed one NATO soldier and wounded two, NATO said.
6963	APW_ENG_20070409.0043.LDC2009T13	Officials did not release the nationality of those soldiers and did not give details or say where exactly in the south the attacks took place.
6964	APW_ENG_20070409.0043.LDC2009T13	The Canadians' deaths appeared to be the biggest single combat loss for foreign troops in Afghanistan since June 2005, when a U.S. helicopter crashed.
6965	APW_ENG_20070409.0043.LDC2009T13	Sixteen American troops died after the aircraft was apparently hit by a rocket-propelled grenade.
6966	APW_ENG_20070409.0043.LDC2009T13	The fatalities underline how virulent Afghanistan's Taliban-led resistance remains, more than five years after a U.S.-led invasion drove the hardline militia from power for harboring al- Qaida.
6967	APW_ENG_20070409.0043.LDC2009T13	Elsewhere in southern Afghanistan, freelance journalist and translator Ajmal Naqshbandi was beheaded after more than a month in captivity.
6968	APW_ENG_20070409.0043.LDC2009T13	He had been kidnapped along with Italian journalist Daniele Mastrogiacomo and a driver, who had been beheaded earlier.
6969	APW_ENG_20070409.0043.LDC2009T13	Mastrogiacomo, who worked for the daily La Repubblica, was released March 19 in a much criticized swap for five Taliban militants.
6970	APW_ENG_20070409.0043.LDC2009T13	The Taliban had made a similar demand in return for Naqshbandi's release, but the government declined to respond, so he was beheaded, said Shahabuddin Atal, who claimed to be a spokesman for regional Taliban commander Mullah Dadullah.
6971	APW_ENG_20070409.0043.LDC2009T13	The latest violence came days after more than 1,000 NATO and Afghan troops retook Sangin district in the opium-producing Helmand province.

6973	APW_ENG_20070409.0043.LDC2009T13	She added that NATO already has transported about 500 Afghan forces to the south.

6975	APW_ENG_20070409.0043.LDC2009T13	About 4,500 NATO and 1,000 Afghan forces are in and around Helmand province as part of Operation Achilles.

7044	APW_ENG_20070412.1125.LDC2009T13	LITTLE ROCK 2007-04-12 15:25:39 UTC
7045	APW_ENG_20070412.1125.LDC2009T13	The Arkansas Supreme Court ruled Thursday that a state judge was wrong to dismiss Wal-Mart's lawsuit to break a retirement deal with a convicted former executive, saying the world's largest retailer is entitled to have a jury hear its claims.
7046	APW_ENG_20070412.1125.LDC2009T13	Wal-Mart Stores Inc., based in Bentonville, Arkansas, wants to void a multi-million-dollar retirement settlement it gave to Tom Coughlin, who later pleaded guilty to defrauding the company through the misuse of gift cards and expense reimbursements.
7047	APW_ENG_20070412.1125.LDC2009T13	Wal-Mart and Coughlin had signed a pact in which the two sides agreed not to sue the other for grievances that might come to light after Coughlin's departure.
7048	APW_ENG_20070412.1125.LDC2009T13	However, the company said it discovered Coughlin's fraud after that pact was signed and believes Sam Walton's former right-hand man was obligated to reveal his deceit before retiring.
7049	APW_ENG_20070412.1125.LDC2009T13	"Wal-Mart has sufficiently stated a claim that it would not have entered the retirement agreement and release had it known of Coughlin's misconduct," the justices ruled unanimously.
7050	APW_ENG_20070412.1125.LDC2009T13	Separately, federal prosecutors will argue in a federal appeals court later Thursday that Coughlin should serve a term in jail.
7051	APW_ENG_20070412.1125.LDC2009T13	In October, Coughlin began a 26-month term of home detention.
7052	APW_ENG_20070412.1125.LDC2009T13	Lawyers estimate Coughlin's retirement package is worth $12 million (euro8.91 million) to $15 million (euro11.14 million).
7053	APW_ENG_20070412.1125.LDC2009T13	Coughlin's lawyers say Coughlin did not defraud the company while negotiating his January 2005 retirement after 28 years with the company.
7054	APW_ENG_20070412.1125.LDC2009T13	He remained on Wal-Mart's board after his retirement, but by April of that 2005, Wal-Mart said it was suspending Coughlin's benefits amid allegations that the former executive used Wal-Mart money and gift cards to pay for personal items.
7055	APW_ENG_20070412.1125.LDC2009T13	Coughlin later pleaded guilty after prosecutors claimed that Wal-Mart had paid for his hunting trips, hunting dog training, clothes, alcohol and parts and service for his vehicles.
7056	APW_ENG_20070412.1125.LDC2009T13	Coughlin pleaded guilty to fraud and tax charges in federal court and Wal-Mart sued to have his benefits canceled.
7057	APW_ENG_20070412.1125.LDC2009T13	Circuit Judge Jay Finch dismissed the suit, citing the pact the two sides had signed.
7058	APW_ENG_20070412.1125.LDC2009T13	Wal-Mart lawyer Theodore Boutrous argued before the state Supreme Court that Coughlin had a duty to disclose the fraud.
7059	APW_ENG_20070412.1125.LDC2009T13	However, "He knew that if he told the truth, he wouldn't get a retirement package.
7060	APW_ENG_20070412.1125.LDC2009T13	If he told the truth, he would be terminated.

7066	APW_ENG_20070414.0635.LDC2009T13	Kony has appeared in public only a handful of times, fearing arrest and extradition to the Hague to answer war crimes charges.
7067	APW_ENG_20070414.0635.LDC2009T13	During the LRA's two-decade insurgency, the group has been blamed for murder, mutilations and kidnapping children for use as soldiers and sex slaves.

7069	APW_ENG_20070414.0635.LDC2009T13	Both sides signed a truce in August and began peace talks, but the deal has been undermined with the two trading accusations of hostility.
7070	APW_ENG_20070414.0635.LDC2009T13	Under the new truce, rebel fighters have until the end of June to gather in Ri-Kwangba, where they will be protected and monitored while a broader peace deal is negotiated.
7071	APW_ENG_20070414.0635.LDC2009T13	Renewed talks will begin April 26.
7072	APW_ENG_20070414.0635.LDC2009T13	"We are enjoying ourselves, the atmosphere is good and we are happy to be resuming the talks," Ojul said.
7073	APW_ENG_20070414.0635.LDC2009T13	Ojul and the government's top negotiator, Internal Affairs Minister Ruhakana Rugunda, signed the truce.
7074	APW_ENG_20070414.0635.LDC2009T13	Kony was wearing civilian clothes, not a military uniform, as a "gesture of goodwill," Ojul said.
7075	APW_ENG_20070414.0635.LDC2009T13	The Lord's Resistance Army is made up of the remnants of a rebellion that began after Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni took power in 1986.

7081	APW_ENG_20070416.1157.LDC2009T13	J. Pedro Reinhard, a senior adviser whom Dow Chemical Co. fired last week along with a company officer, said Monday he was not involved in any clandestine effort to take over the company, the reason given by Dow Chemical for their dismissal.
7082	APW_ENG_20070416.1157.LDC2009T13	"I categorically deny that I have been part of any secret effort to take over or acquire Dow Chemical," Reinhard said in a statement.
7083	APW_ENG_20070416.1157.LDC2009T13	Andrew Liveris, the company's chairman and chief executive officer, said Thursday that Reinhard, who retired as the Midland, Michigan-based chemical giant's chief financial officer in October 2005, and Romeo Kreinberg, a divisional executive vice president, were dismissed with the approval of the board of directors.
7084	APW_ENG_20070416.1157.LDC2009T13	Reinhard, a 37-year veteran of the company, remains a member of the board because only shareholders, not management, can remove directors.
7085	APW_ENG_20070416.1157.LDC2009T13	Dow Chemical's board took a step Monday toward having Reinhard removed from that body.
7086	APW_ENG_20070416.1157.LDC2009T13	The directors revised their slate of approved nominees for board election that will be presented May 10 at the annual shareholders meeting in Midland, Michigan, and Reinhard was the only one of the 12 directors who was not approved for re-election.
7087	APW_ENG_20070416.1157.LDC2009T13	The board also reduced its size to 11 members, to take effect at the time of the meeting.
7088	APW_ENG_20070416.1157.LDC2009T13	Kreinberg said Thursday there was no truth to the accusations made against him.
7089	APW_ENG_20070416.1157.LDC2009T13	Both he and Reinhard said they were exploring their legal options.
7090	APW_ENG_20070416.1157.LDC2009T13	"I have always faithfully complied with my fiduciary duties to Dow," Reinhard said.
7091	APW_ENG_20070416.1157.LDC2009T13	"My conscience is clear."
7092	APW_ENG_20070416.1157.LDC2009T13	On April 8, The Sunday Express, a British tabloid, reported that a group of Middle Eastern investors and U.S. buyout firms was preparing a bid for Dow Chemical, which makes and sells chemicals, plastics and farm products to customers in a range of industries.
7093	APW_ENG_20070416.1157.LDC2009T13	The newspaper first reported in January that several private equity firms were interested in Dow Chemical.

7098	APW_ENG_20070418.1355.LDC2009T13	MANILA, Philippines 2007-04-18 17:43:58 UTC
7099	APW_ENG_20070418.1355.LDC2009T13	A freelance journalist who said she left New York's "rat race" for the adventure of the Peace Corps was found dead Wednesday, her body in a shallow grave in the northern Philippines where she had gone to hike, officials said.
7100	APW_ENG_20070418.1355.LDC2009T13	Police said they believed foul play was involved in the death of Julia Campbell, 40, from Fairfax, Virginia, who came to the country two years ago and had about two weeks left in an English- teaching stint.
7101	APW_ENG_20070418.1355.LDC2009T13	She went missing April 8 on a solo trip to see the famed mountainside rice terraces of Banaue, in Ifugao province north of Manila.
7102	APW_ENG_20070418.1355.LDC2009T13	More than 80 police commandos, soldiers and volunteers had searched for Campbell in the rugged area, backed by helicopters and tracking dogs.
7103	APW_ENG_20070418.1355.LDC2009T13	Her body was found buried in a dry riverbed, where a stray dog had dug out one of her feet.
7104	APW_ENG_20070418.1355.LDC2009T13	Army spokesman Lt. Col. Ernesto Torres said officials at the site confirmed that the body was Campbell's, saying she was wearing the same clothes as when she was last seen buying soda from a store in Batad town, not far from the grave site.
7105	APW_ENG_20070418.1355.LDC2009T13	Her glasses were found near a trail about 50 meters (165 feet) away, with one of the lenses laying nearby.
7106	APW_ENG_20070418.1355.LDC2009T13	No cause of death was immediately available.
7107	APW_ENG_20070418.1355.LDC2009T13	Campbell's body was being flown Thursday to Camp Crame, the national police headquarters in Manila, where forensics experts were set to examine it.
7108	APW_ENG_20070418.1355.LDC2009T13	During the search, officials had speculated that Campbell might have fallen off a cliff.
7109	APW_ENG_20070418.1355.LDC2009T13	But now they have opened a criminal investigation.
7110	APW_ENG_20070418.1355.LDC2009T13	"This is no longer an accident," Ifugao provincial police chief Senior Superintendent Pedro Ganir told The Associated Press by telephone.
7111	APW_ENG_20070418.1355.LDC2009T13	Campbell had worked for The New York Times, People magazine, Fox.com, CourtTV.com and Star Magazine, and had reported for CNN on a December typhoon that hit the area where she was working for the Peace Corps.
7112	APW_ENG_20070418.1355.LDC2009T13	"At the age of 38, I decided to step out of the rat race of New York, join the Peace Corps and board a plane for Manila," Campbell wrote in her blog.
7113	APW_ENG_20070418.1355.LDC2009T13	Peace Corps director Ron Tschetter said Campbell, who was among the organization's 137 volunteers currently in the Philippines, "contributed greatly to the lives of Filipino citizens."
7114	APW_ENG_20070418.1355.LDC2009T13	"Julia was a proud member of the Peace Corps family, and she contributed greatly to the lives of Filipino citizens," Tschetter said in a statement.
7115	APW_ENG_20070418.1355.LDC2009T13	He had traveled to the Philippines to join the search for Campbell, and he praised the local police effort to find her as "incredible."
7116	APW_ENG_20070418.1355.LDC2009T13	"The U.S. Peace Corps is saddened by the loss of such a dedicated and vibrant volunteer, who so loved this country," Tschetter said.
7117	APW_ENG_20070418.1355.LDC2009T13	"Our hearts go out to her family and friends in the United States."
7118	APW_ENG_20070418.1355.LDC2009T13	On Tuesday, Philippine national police chief Oscar Calderon ruled out communist rebels' involvement in Campbell's disappearance, "because the area has been cleared of insurgents."
7119	APW_ENG_20070418.1355.LDC2009T13	She had bought a bus ticket to return to Manila by April 9, indicating she did not plan to extend her stay or make a long hike to a spot to look at the rice terraces, he said.
7120	APW_ENG_20070418.1355.LDC2009T13	"It's horrible," said Michael Cooper, a New York Times political reporter who had worked with Campbell at the newspaper when they covered New York City police.
7121	APW_ENG_20070418.1355.LDC2009T13	"She was a very dogged, very hardworking reporter," Cooper said.
7122	APW_ENG_20070418.1355.LDC2009T13	"She put in long hours.
7123	APW_ENG_20070418.1355.LDC2009T13	When doing street reporting, she was always sure to ring the 10th doorbell, not just leave after a few."
7124	APW_ENG_20070418.1355.LDC2009T13	Cooper said that she left the Times to cover hard news for People magazine, and that he had not talked to her for a couple of years.
7125	APW_ENG_20070418.1355.LDC2009T13	Campbell had been teaching English at the Divine Word College in Albay province's Legazpi city, southeast of Manila, since October 2006.
7126	APW_ENG_20070418.1355.LDC2009T13	She previously taught at a public school in Donsol in nearby Sorsogon province, said Nora Gallano, assistant dean of Divine Word's College of Liberal Arts.
7127	APW_ENG_20070418.1355.LDC2009T13	"She just felt not fulfilled in New York, and shocked us when she said she was joining the Peace Corps," said her aunt, Ann Knight, of Pensacola, Florida.
7128	APW_ENG_20070418.1355.LDC2009T13	"She was doing what she wanted to do."
7129	APW_ENG_20070418.1355.LDC2009T13	Knight described her niece as "a very adventuresome, very interesting, loving, giving person who loved a good story."
7130	APW_ENG_20070418.1355.LDC2009T13	Campbell had moved around a lot as a child because her father was in the Marines.
7131	APW_ENG_20070418.1355.LDC2009T13	She graduated from high school in Fairfax, where her mother still lives.

7135	APW_ENG_20070423.0312.LDC2009T13	LUXEMBOURG 2007-04-23 09:05:52 UTC
7136	APW_ENG_20070423.0312.LDC2009T13	Javier Solana, the EU's foreign policy chief, will meet with top Iranian negotiator Ali Larijani Wednesday in Ankara to see if Iran can be persuaded to halt uranium enrichment in exchange for negotiations about economic incentives.
7137	APW_ENG_20070423.0312.LDC2009T13	"I am going to meet him Wednesday ... in Ankara (to) see if we can move to a negotiation," Solana said on arrival at an EU foreign ministers meeting.
7138	APW_ENG_20070423.0312.LDC2009T13	He did not elaborate.
7139	APW_ENG_20070423.0312.LDC2009T13	In a related devlopment later Monday, the foreign ministers approved -- without debate -- a second round of U.N. sanctions adopted by the Security Council in March.
7140	APW_ENG_20070423.0312.LDC2009T13	These ban Iranian arms exports and freeze the assets of 28 additional individuals and organizations involved in the country's nuclear and missile programs.
7141	APW_ENG_20070423.0312.LDC2009T13	About a third of these individuals have links to Iran's Revolutionary Guard, an elite military corps.
7142	APW_ENG_20070423.0312.LDC2009T13	The package also calls for voluntary restrictions on travel by the individuals subject to sanctions, on arms sales to Iran, and on new financial assistance or loans to the Iranian government.
7143	APW_ENG_20070423.0312.LDC2009T13	In the bid to push Iran to drop some aspects of its nuclear program, Solana is negotiating on behalf of permanent U.N. Security Council members France, Britain, Russia, the United States and China, as well as Germany.
7144	APW_ENG_20070423.0312.LDC2009T13	The international community wants Tehran to freeze uranium enrichment work before any talks can be held on a package of economic and other incentives for Iran, including assistance for its nuclear power generation program.
7145	APW_ENG_20070423.0312.LDC2009T13	Iran has started feeding small amounts of uranium gas into centrifuges that can enrich it to weapons-grade level and is already running more than 1,300 of the machines, according to an International Atomic Energy Agency document obtained last week by The Associated Press.
7146	APW_ENG_20070423.0312.LDC2009T13	The IAEA has protested Iran's decision to prevent agency inspectors from visiting the country's heavy water reactor, which, when built, will produce plutonium.
7147	APW_ENG_20070423.0312.LDC2009T13	Enriched uranium and plutonium can both be used for the fissile core of nuclear warheads.
7148	APW_ENG_20070423.0312.LDC2009T13	Iran denies it plans to produce nuclear weapons, saying it only wants to generate energy.
7149	APW_ENG_20070423.1050.LDC2009T13	Tribeca festival presents a diverse lineup for a myriad of moviegoers
7150	APW_ENG_20070423.1050.LDC2009T13	NEW YORK 2007-04-23 18:02:53 UTC
7151	APW_ENG_20070423.1050.LDC2009T13	The word "tentpole" is used to describe a blockbuster movie that can appeal to everyone.
7152	APW_ENG_20070423.1050.LDC2009T13	If it were applied to a festival, the Tribeca Film Festival would be it.
7153	APW_ENG_20070423.1050.LDC2009T13	The sixth annual festival opens Wednesday with a wide selection of international art house fare, populist premieres and family friendly films -- 157 features and 88 shorts jammed into 12 days of screenings, panel discussions and parties.
7154	APW_ENG_20070423.1050.LDC2009T13	Since being founded in response to the Sept. 11 attacks by Robert De Niro, his producing partner, Jane Rosenthal, and her husband, the entrepreneur Craig Hatkoff, the Tribeca festival has gradually developed an identity as diverse as the city itself.
7155	APW_ENG_20070423.1050.LDC2009T13	"We're showing everything from an avant garde film called `Passio' with live music by Arvo Part at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine -- to `Spider-Man 3,'" said chief festival programmer and executive director Peter Scarlet.
7156	APW_ENG_20070423.1050.LDC2009T13	"You can't get two things that are more unlike each other, but it's that almost surreal juxtaposition of different kinds of things that I think is an example of how we're trying to redefine what a film festival is."
7157	APW_ENG_20070423.1050.LDC2009T13	Tribeca was launched in 2002, as Rosenthal says, because of an "act of war."
7158	APW_ENG_20070423.1050.LDC2009T13	She and De Niro wanted to do something to benefit their neighborhood, just north of where the World Trade Center towers once stood.
7159	APW_ENG_20070423.1050.LDC2009T13	They began with no long-term plans, but six years later, the festival has become an international fixture -- nestled between the more domestic Sundance Film Festival in January and the pre- eminent international fest, Cannes, in mid-May.
7160	APW_ENG_20070423.1050.LDC2009T13	Because of its origins, Tribeca will always be defined by its connection to Sept. 11 and the continuing reverberations of that tragedy.
7161	APW_ENG_20070423.1050.LDC2009T13	"We are a political festival," said Rosenthal in a recent interview in her Tribeca office.
7162	APW_ENG_20070423.1050.LDC2009T13	Though Tribeca in its early years intentionally opened with heartwarming comedies like "About a Boy," last year it confronted its history by opening with "United 93," the documentary-like recounting of the flight that crashed in Pennsylvania on Sept. 11.
7163	APW_ENG_20070423.1050.LDC2009T13	The festival has increasingly highlighted films that deal with post-Sept.11 issues like the Iraq and Afghanistan wars.
7164	APW_ENG_20070423.1050.LDC2009T13	That mission expands this year with a series of global warming-themed short films produced by the SOS (Save Our Selves) campaign.
7165	APW_ENG_20070423.1050.LDC2009T13	They will open the festival in a gala hosted by Al Gore on Wednesday.
7166	APW_ENG_20070423.1050.LDC2009T13	"We will do things and show things and whether you like it or not, it's something to see and it's ways to ask questions," said Rosenthal.
7167	APW_ENG_20070423.1050.LDC2009T13	"We might be able to do something about climate change quicker than we can do something about our current administration."
7168	APW_ENG_20070423.1050.LDC2009T13	Among this year's political documentaries are "Taxi to the Dark Side" by Alex Gibney ("Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room"), which details the policies behind the Abu Ghraib scandal
7169	APW_ENG_20070423.1050.LDC2009T13	"Beyond Belief," about two Sept. 11 widows traveling to Afghanistan
7170	APW_ENG_20070423.1050.LDC2009T13	and "I Am an American Soldier: One Year in Iraq in the 101st Airborne," for which filmmaker John Laurence documented soldiers' lives for 14 months.
7171	APW_ENG_20070423.1050.LDC2009T13	Among the big-tent events are the U.S. premiere of "Spider-Man 3" on April 30
7172	APW_ENG_20070423.1050.LDC2009T13	the premiere of Curtis Hanson's romance "Lucky You," starring Eric Bana and Drew Barrymore
7173	APW_ENG_20070423.1050.LDC2009T13	and one of the festival's signature events: the Tribeca Drive-in.
7174	APW_ENG_20070423.1050.LDC2009T13	"It's really a sit-in," joked Rosenthal, explaining that the outdoor screenings are her favorite part of the festival.
7175	APW_ENG_20070423.1050.LDC2009T13	This year will feature a 20th anniversary screening of "Dirty Dancing," the animated "Surf's Up" and "Planet B-Boy," a documentary about breakdancing.
7176	APW_ENG_20070423.1050.LDC2009T13	A new addition this year also pays respect to a genre often given scant attention at movie festivals: the sports movie.
7177	APW_ENG_20070423.1050.LDC2009T13	Sponsored by ESPN, Tribeca will present 14 premieres of sports-related films, as well as a screening of the baseball classic "The Natural."
7178	APW_ENG_20070423.1050.LDC2009T13	Serving as ambassadors of the sports festival are former National Foortball League running back and now TV personality Tiki Barber, and tennis legend Billie Jean King.
7179	APW_ENG_20070423.1050.LDC2009T13	Movies playing in the Tribeca Family Festival include "Gumby: The Movie" and a documentary on student council races in four different middle schools entitled "The Third Monday in October."
7180	APW_ENG_20070423.1050.LDC2009T13	A festival's merit is often measured in its ability to present movies appealing to distributors -- it is a marketplace.
7181	APW_ENG_20070423.1050.LDC2009T13	The two most successful Tribeca-showcased films are "Transamerica," which went on to yield Felicity Huffman a best actress Academy Award nomination, and "Jesus Camp," which received an Oscar nomination this year for best documentary.
7182	APW_ENG_20070423.1050.LDC2009T13	"I'd like to see a narrative picture break out in a mainstream way, but that takes time," said Rosenthal.
7183	APW_ENG_20070423.1050.LDC2009T13	"You can't do anything about it."
7184	APW_ENG_20070423.1050.LDC2009T13	Predicting what will catch on this year is impossible, but among the eagerly awaited films are the Leonardo DiCaprio-produced "Gardener of Eden"
7185	APW_ENG_20070423.1050.LDC2009T13	the poker mockumentary "The Grand"
7186	APW_ENG_20070423.1050.LDC2009T13	and "Lady Chatterley," an adaptation of the second version (of three) of D.H. Lawrence's erotic novel.
7187	APW_ENG_20070423.1050.LDC2009T13	The film won five Cesar Awards, the French equivalent of the Oscars.
7188	APW_ENG_20070423.1050.LDC2009T13	But there are many more, from 47 countries and territories.
7189	APW_ENG_20070423.1050.LDC2009T13	Among the international entries are the Turkish "Times and Winds," the Kurdish "Half Moon" and "The Last Man," hyped as the first Lebanese vampire movie.
7190	APW_ENG_20070423.1050.LDC2009T13	The festival can similarly boast the first movie directed by Fred Durst, frontman of rock-rap group Limp Bizkit: "The Education of Charlie Banks."
7191	APW_ENG_20070423.1050.LDC2009T13	It's surely a sign that at Tribeca, everyone is welcome.

7193	APW_ENG_20070426.1514.LDC2009T13	ATLANTA 2007-04-26 18:52:12 UTC
7194	APW_ENG_20070426.1514.LDC2009T13	Earthlink Inc. says it will study the performance of its citywide wireless Internet networks in four cities -- Philadelphia, New Orleans and California's Anaheim and Milpitas -- before deciding how to move forward with similar municipal Wi-Fi networks elsewhere in the U.S.
7195	APW_ENG_20070426.1514.LDC2009T13	While more cities are expressing interest in striking deals with the company, Earthlink is "not yet able to establish that comfort level" that the investments are really profitable, Kevin Dotts, chief financial officer for the Atlanta-based company, said Thursday.
7196	APW_ENG_20070426.1514.LDC2009T13	That doesn't mean Earthlink is pulling the plug on cities under contract, like Houston, which would eventually be the nation's largest network at about 600 square miles (1,550 sq. kilometers), Dotts said.
7197	APW_ENG_20070426.1514.LDC2009T13	Instead, the company wants to review a range of factors to determine where it would be most profitable to invest what Dotts estimates are up to $40 million a year in capital expenditure.
7198	APW_ENG_20070426.1514.LDC2009T13	Factors include topography -- less dense cities like Atlanta are harder to cover
7199	APW_ENG_20070426.1514.LDC2009T13	concentration of households
7200	APW_ENG_20070426.1514.LDC2009T13	and alternative revenues like electronic gas reading services, Dotts said.
7201	APW_ENG_20070426.1514.LDC2009T13	He added the company will closely study the four designated markets over the next few months before defining its strategy.
7202	APW_ENG_20070426.1514.LDC2009T13	He said it will probably focus any expansion on large metropolitan areas like Chicago.
7203	APW_ENG_20070426.1514.LDC2009T13	Also Thursday, Earthlink announced it posted a loss of $29.9 million, or 24 cents per share, in the latest period.
7204	APW_ENG_20070426.1514.LDC2009T13	A year ago, it had reported earnings of $16.3 million, or 12 cents per share.

7210	APW_ENG_20070429.0018.LDC2009T13	Three police were also wounded.
7211	APW_ENG_20070429.0018.LDC2009T13	Lt. Col. Angela Billings, spokeswoman for NATO's International Security Assistance Force or ISAF, confirmed that NATO launched an airstrike early Saturday, causing some insurgent casualties.
7212	APW_ENG_20070429.0018.LDC2009T13	She said there were no NATO or civilian casualties.
7213	APW_ENG_20070429.0018.LDC2009T13	The latest violence came as NATO-led forces pushed forward with their largest-ever operation in southern Afghanistan to root out militants in Helmand province's opium-producing heartland.
7214	APW_ENG_20070429.0018.LDC2009T13	On Saturday in Helmand, Afghan and coalition forces killed 10 suspected Taliban in a clash and airstrike, the coalition said in a statement.

7225	APW_ENG_20070501.0242.LDC2009T13	A huge explosion blamed on a gas leak ripped through an apartment building in northern Spain on Tuesday, toppling the building and killing at least two people, officials said.
7226	APW_ENG_20070501.0242.LDC2009T13	Sixteen people were injured.
7227	APW_ENG_20070501.0242.LDC2009T13	The five-story building collapsed in smoke and flames in the city of Palencia.
7228	APW_ENG_20070501.0242.LDC2009T13	Its mayor, Heliodoro Gallego, said the blast was apparently caused by a gas leak.

7231	APW_ENG_20070501.1082.LDC2009T13	Joost, a company attempting to broadcast television via the Internet, said Tuesday it had signed several new content distribution agreements, including one with Turner Broadcasting System Inc. to show CNN news and interview programs.
7232	APW_ENG_20070501.1082.LDC2009T13	The company also announced its "commercial availability" -- which means it will allow current users to invite anyone to use its service, which is free.
7233	APW_ENG_20070501.1082.LDC2009T13	"Later this month we will be completely open" and allow anyone to download the Joost software from the company's Web site, said Yvette Alberdingk Thijm, the company's top executive for content acquisition, in a telephone interview.
7234	APW_ENG_20070501.1082.LDC2009T13	"This is the way you normally ramp up peer-to-peer software ... and it's a way to give our friends a little bit of a scoop."
7235	APW_ENG_20070501.1082.LDC2009T13	Joost -- pronounced "juiced" -- was co-founded by Janus Friis and Niklas Zennstrom, the entrepreneurs who upset the music industry with the Kazaa file-sharing service and then developed Skype, the Internet telephone system that was bought by eBay Inc. for at least US$2.6 billion in 2005.
7236	APW_ENG_20070501.1082.LDC2009T13	Joost operates by distributing streaming video of shows from "peer-to-peer," or user-to-user, over the Internet.
7237	APW_ENG_20070501.1082.LDC2009T13	Consumers choose a channel via a software interface on their desktop that resembles a remote control.
7238	APW_ENG_20070501.1082.LDC2009T13	Like regular TV, it is free for viewers, and aims to be ad-supported.
7239	APW_ENG_20070501.1082.LDC2009T13	In Tuesday's deal, Joost said it will air episodes of "Aqua Teen Hunger Force" and "Robot Chicken" from Turner's Adult Swim network, while it would air "Larry King Live," among other news and interview programs from Turner's CNN, which is owned by Time Warner Inc.
7240	APW_ENG_20070501.1082.LDC2009T13	Joost also announced several other content deals Tuesday: Sony will run episodes of several old TV series including "Charlie's Angels" and "Starsky &amp
7241	APW_ENG_20070501.1082.LDC2009T13	Hutch" on Joost
7242	APW_ENG_20070501.1082.LDC2009T13	Sports Illustrated will run photo shoots and programs about its swimsuit issue
7243	APW_ENG_20070501.1082.LDC2009T13	the National Hockey League will broadcast vintage games, game highlights, and, later, full matches
7244	APW_ENG_20070501.1082.LDC2009T13	and Hasbro will run old episodes of "Transformers" and "G.I. Joe."
7245	APW_ENG_20070501.1082.LDC2009T13	Joost has previously signed deals with Viacom Inc., Warner Music Group Corp. and CBS Corp
7246	APW_ENG_20070501.1082.LDC2009T13	it has advertising trials with numerous companies, including Coca-Cola Co., Nike Inc., Microsoft Corp., Procter &amp
7247	APW_ENG_20070501.1082.LDC2009T13	Gamble Co., Sony Corp. and Visa.
7248	APW_ENG_20070501.1082.LDC2009T13	It is seen as one of the many candidates to become a primary distributor of television and video over the Internet, competing against Google Inc., YouTube, Revver Inc., broadcasters' own Web sites, an as-yet unnamed cooperation between NBC and NewsCorp., and file-sharing programs such as BitTorrent, among others.
7249	APW_ENG_20070501.1082.LDC2009T13	Joost's Viacom deal was particularly noteworthy as it came close on the heels of Viacom's lawsuit against Google for alleged copyright infringement.
7250	APW_ENG_20070501.1082.LDC2009T13	In contrast to Kazaa, Joost actively seeks deals with copyright holders and promises to protect music and images on its platform against piracy.
7251	APW_ENG_20070501.1082.LDC2009T13	"This is a mode of distribution that Viacom is more comfortable with," said Loeb &amp
7252	APW_ENG_20070501.1082.LDC2009T13	Loeb attorney Ken Florin, who was not involved in Tuesday's deal.
7253	APW_ENG_20070501.1082.LDC2009T13	"Internet ad revenue could become a very effective way to monetize maybe not the same content, but content that appeals to a different audience," specifically 18-34 year old men.
7254	APW_ENG_20070501.1082.LDC2009T13	Alberdingk Thijm said Joost was not aiming to be a venue for B-grade programming and reruns, pointing to CSI and Adult Swim programs as among the highest viewer ratings in the U.S. cable industry.
7255	APW_ENG_20070501.1082.LDC2009T13	She could not disclose details of specific deals, but said ad revenues were shared between Joost and the content providers
7256	APW_ENG_20070501.1082.LDC2009T13	while advertisers were charged on a per-view basis.
7257	APW_ENG_20070501.1082.LDC2009T13	Due to the nature of Joost's Internet-based platform, ads are matched with appropriate content and views are exactly measured, she said.
7258	APW_ENG_20070501.1082.LDC2009T13	Alberdingk Thijm said the company is still experimenting with when and how it will run ads, including short advertisements before or after programs, traditional 30-second ads in the middle of longer programs, and more experimental ideas such as ads that appear on the screen briefly and then fade away while a program is running.
7259	APW_ENG_20070501.1082.LDC2009T13	Overall, she said, there would be less advertising than on regular TV.
7260	APW_ENG_20070501.1082.LDC2009T13	Joost is owned by Friis and Zennstrom via their Luxembourg-based Joost Operations SA, but it has offices in New York, London and Leiden, Netherlands, and expects to incorporate under the Joost name globally.

7265	APW_ENG_20070502.0032.LDC2009T13	Tensions between Estonia and Russia grew as the Baltic country's foreign minister canceled a meeting with lawmakers from Moscow, saying they were spreading lies about a disputed Soviet monument.
7266	APW_ENG_20070502.0032.LDC2009T13	The two-day visit by a delegation from Russia's State Duma was meant to defuse a diplomatic row between the two countries over Estonia's removal of the Bronze Soldier statue from downtown Tallinn.
7267	APW_ENG_20070502.0032.LDC2009T13	But it only appeared to have escalated the feud.
7268	APW_ENG_20070502.0032.LDC2009T13	"I will not meet with a delegation that spreads only lies regarding events in Estonia and whose objective is not the accurate portrayal of the situation, but rather election campaigning," Foreign Minister Urmas Paet said in a statement issued Tuesday.
7269	APW_ENG_20070502.0032.LDC2009T13	The Estonian capital was rocked by violent clashes last week between riot police and ethnic Russian protesters, angered by the government's decision to move the Bronze Soldier, a statue honoring Soviet troops killed during World War II.
7270	APW_ENG_20070502.0032.LDC2009T13	Many ethnic Estonians consider the monument a bitter reminder of five decades of Soviet occupation.
7271	APW_ENG_20070502.0032.LDC2009T13	One man was stabbed to death, more than 150 people were hurt and 1,100 detained in the worst riots since Estonia regained independence from the Soviet Union in 1991.
7272	APW_ENG_20070502.0032.LDC2009T13	Estonian police banned public gatherings in the capital region starting Tuesday and extended a ban on alcohol retail sales through May 9, fearing unrest on the date when ethnic Russians traditionally celebrate the Red Army's 1945 defeat of Nazi Germany.
7273	APW_ENG_20070502.0032.LDC2009T13	The delegation from Moscow, headed by Leonid Slutsky, vice chairman of the Duma's foreign affairs committee, placed a wreath of flowers at the statue Tuesday, a day after it was re-erected at a military cemetery outside the city center.
7274	APW_ENG_20070502.0032.LDC2009T13	At the start of the visit, the Russians called on the Estonian government to resign.
7275	APW_ENG_20070502.0032.LDC2009T13	On Tuesday, one of them suggested the statue had been damaged in the move.
7276	APW_ENG_20070502.0032.LDC2009T13	"We see marks -- they are masked, of course, the statue has been restored -- but one can see that it has been subjected to sawing," Nikolai Kovalyov, chairman of the Duma veteran's affairs committee, said in comments shown on Russia's NTV television.
7277	APW_ENG_20070502.0032.LDC2009T13	Estonia forcefully denied any damage to the statue, saying that bronze statues are made in pieces that are joined together.
7278	APW_ENG_20070502.0032.LDC2009T13	Paet said the visitors were "out of line" and accused them of spreading lies about the monument.
7279	APW_ENG_20070502.0032.LDC2009T13	Russia is considering sanctions against Estonia, but Kovalyov said at a news conference they were "not an efficient instrument" because they would also hit ethnic Russians in the Baltic country.
7280	APW_ENG_20070502.0032.LDC2009T13	In Moscow, however, Mayor Yuri Luzhkov called for a boycott on Estonia and its products.
7281	APW_ENG_20070502.0032.LDC2009T13	Russian media reported that Russian police detained a few demonstrators at the Estonian Embassy, after an Estonian flag was ripped off its pole outside the building.
7282	APW_ENG_20070502.0032.LDC2009T13	The flag was later restored.
7283	APW_ENG_20070502.0032.LDC2009T13	The dispute has strained already tense relations between the Kremlin and Estonia, and highlighted long-standing Russian complaints about the treatment of Russian-speaking minorities in Estonia and neighboring Latvia.
7284	APW_ENG_20070502.0032.LDC2009T13	While Russian speakers in the Baltic states enjoyed advantages under Soviet rule, many now struggle to get education, deal with government offices and get jobs amid a resurgence in native languages and inroads by English.
7285	APW_ENG_20070502.0032.LDC2009T13	Late Tuesday, Paet urged the European Union, of which Estonia has been a member since 2004, to express support for his country.
7286	APW_ENG_20070502.0032.LDC2009T13	He also said that hacker attacks blocking several Estonian government Web sites had been traced to IP addresses linked to "the office of the Russian president and individuals at Russian government organizations."
7287	APW_ENG_20070502.0032.LDC2009T13	The Estonian government was to officially inaugurate the statue at its new location on May 8, a day before Russians celebrate the Allied victory over Nazi Germany.
7288	APW_ENG_20070502.0032.LDC2009T13	In the next step of its contentious plan, the government wants to move the remains of Soviet soldiers believed to be buried next to the statue's original site.
7289	APW_ENG_20070502.0032.LDC2009T13	Archeologists excavating the grave said they had found 12 coffins by Monday, and opened six of them to examine the remains.

7294	APW_ENG_20070503.1093.LDC2009T13	Government forces and Tamil Tiger rebels clashed for a third straight day in northern Sri Lanka on Thursday, as Britain suspended millions of dollars in aid payments to the country amid the intensified fighting.
7295	APW_ENG_20070503.1093.LDC2009T13	The insurgents attacked a bunker along the defensive lines outside Vavuniya, the last government-held town before rebel territory in northern Sri Lanka, killing a police officer, military spokesman Lt. Col. Upali Rajapakse said.
7296	APW_ENG_20070503.1093.LDC2009T13	Separately, the rebels said three combatants were killed as they beat back a military assault in Vavuniya and in Mannar, also in the north.
7297	APW_ENG_20070503.1093.LDC2009T13	"We have captured two dead bodies of the Sri Lankan soldiers and one of our soldiers was killed in action," rebel spokesman Rasiah Ilanthirayan said.
7298	APW_ENG_20070503.1093.LDC2009T13	Rajapakse said he had heard no reports of those clashes.
7299	APW_ENG_20070503.1093.LDC2009T13	The fighting took place a day after the military said at least 13 insurgents had been killed in two days of fierce battles along the front lines in the north -- news that heightened concerns that the renewed ethnic war was entering an even bloodier phase.
7300	APW_ENG_20070503.1093.LDC2009T13	Britain, which had agreed to give US$5.9 million (euro4.3 million) to help Sri Lanka pay down its debts to the World Bank, has suspended the program after making only half the payments, a spokesman for the British High Commission in Colombo said on customary condition of anonymity.
7301	APW_ENG_20070503.1093.LDC2009T13	The payments will resume if a series of conditions are met, including no unjustified increases in military spending and no instigations of hostility, the official said.
7302	APW_ENG_20070503.1093.LDC2009T13	There was no immediate government response to the news.
7303	APW_ENG_20070503.1093.LDC2009T13	The aid suspension came as a senior British diplomat planned a trip to war-torn northern Sri Lanka to meet rebel leaders and urge them to return to peace talks.
7304	APW_ENG_20070503.1093.LDC2009T13	British Deputy High Commissioner to Sri Lanka Lesley Craig had been due to travel Thursday to Kilinochchi, the main rebel-held city, but the trip was postponed, the spokesman said.
7305	APW_ENG_20070503.1093.LDC2009T13	While no reason was given for the delay, he said Craig would travel soon to meet with leaders of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, as the rebels are formally known.
7306	APW_ENG_20070503.1093.LDC2009T13	The Sri Lankan government recently barred the Norwegian ambassador from making a similar trip to Kilinochchi.
7307	APW_ENG_20070503.1093.LDC2009T13	Norway helped broker a 2002 cease-fire between the government and rebels, and has continued to serve as a mediator as sporadic fighting has intensified in the past 18 months.
7308	APW_ENG_20070503.1093.LDC2009T13	The cease-fire officially remains in place although the fighting has worsened.
7309	APW_ENG_20070503.1093.LDC2009T13	Both sides insist they respect the truce and are only responding to the other's aggression.
7310	APW_ENG_20070503.1093.LDC2009T13	The government has already ousted insurgents from bases in eastern Sri Lanka, and officials say they plan to make a push soon into the rebels' heartland in the north, where they run a mini-state complete with border guards, schools and traffic police.
7311	APW_ENG_20070503.1093.LDC2009T13	Also Thursday, the military said anti-insurgency commandos found four suicide jackets strapped with bombs, each weighing about 3.5 kilograms (7.7 pounds), hidden in a Hindu temple in eastern Sri Lanka.
7312	APW_ENG_20070503.1093.LDC2009T13	The jackets were found Wednesday in the peak of the 42-foot (12.6-meter) -tall temple in Kokkadichcholai village which was recently captured from Tamil rebels in Batticaloa district, the Defense Ministry said.
7313	APW_ENG_20070503.1093.LDC2009T13	Tamil Tiger suicide bombers have killed former President Ranasinghe Premadasa, former Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, and other political and military leaders.
7314	APW_ENG_20070503.1093.LDC2009T13	The rebels have been fighting since 1983 for a separate homeland for Sri Lanka's 3.1 million Tamils, a largely Hindu minority concentrated in eastern and northern Sri Lanka.
7315	APW_ENG_20070503.1093.LDC2009T13	The Tamils have faced decades of discrimination from the predominantly Buddhist Sinhalese, who comprise a majority of the Indian Ocean island nation's 19 million people.

7320	APW_ENG_20070504.0444.LDC2009T13	Germany's powerful IG Metall union and industrial employers struggled to find common ground early Friday, as make-or-break wage talks entered their second day.
7321	APW_ENG_20070504.0444.LDC2009T13	Leaders from IG Metall, which represents more than 3 million auto workers, steel makers and other engineering professions, began meeting Thursday afternoon to try to agree on how much to raise workers' wages.
7322	APW_ENG_20070504.0444.LDC2009T13	The union has threatened to call a full-blown strike if it can not secure a significant wage increase for its members.
7323	APW_ENG_20070504.0444.LDC2009T13	IG Metall has been pushing for a 6.5 percent raise.
7324	APW_ENG_20070504.0444.LDC2009T13	It rejected an offer employers made last month of a 3 percent increase -- made up of a formal salary rise of 2.5 percent and a half-percent "economy bonus."
7325	APW_ENG_20070504.0444.LDC2009T13	After a 2 1/2-hour break early Friday, a union leader said employers had made a better offer, but declined to provide any numbers.
7326	APW_ENG_20070504.0444.LDC2009T13	More than 300,000 workers walked off their jobs briefly in a rash of warning strikes organized by IG Metall ahead of the talks, in an effort to keep the pressure on employers for what they say is their share of Germany's recent economic upswing.
7327	APW_ENG_20070504.0444.LDC2009T13	"The cupboard is full and we finally want our slice of the ham," said Uwe Hueck, a union representative for Porsche.
7328	APW_ENG_20070504.0444.LDC2009T13	Unemployment in Germany is below 10 percent for the first time since 2002, production is on the rise and optimism among both businesses and consumers is reaching new highs.
7329	APW_ENG_20070504.0444.LDC2009T13	The government has also raised its forecast for 2007 economic growth for the second time this year, predicting that gross domestic product would increase by 2.3 percent.

7335	APW_ENG_20070507.0512.LDC2009T13	Sri Lankan jets pounded rebel positions Monday as the government acknowledged a collapsing cease-fire had been repeatedly violated by both sides and said the country's national security was more important than the truce.
7336	APW_ENG_20070507.0512.LDC2009T13	Hours after the latest attacks on rebel targets, a Nordic truce monitoring mission said the Sri Lankan military had in recent weeks upped the number of airstrikes and assaults on the northern heartland of the Tamil Tiger rebels.
7337	APW_ENG_20070507.0512.LDC2009T13	As violence has spiraled, both sides have insisted they are abiding by the 2002 truce -- which remains officially in place -- and are only responding to the other's aggression.
7338	APW_ENG_20070507.0512.LDC2009T13	But on Monday, government spokesman Keheliya Rambukwella acknowledged the cease-fire "has been violated over and over again" by both sides, and warned: "wherever national security is threatened we will take appropriate action."
7339	APW_ENG_20070507.0512.LDC2009T13	Earlier, the military said fighter jets bombed a rebel base and training camp in Mullativu, a coastal town in the wide swath of northern Sri Lanka controlled by the Tigers.
7340	APW_ENG_20070507.0512.LDC2009T13	Spokesman Brig. Prasad Samarasinghe gave no casualty figures but said a large number of rebels were at the base at the time.
7341	APW_ENG_20070507.0512.LDC2009T13	There was no immediate response from the rebels to the government or military statements, although the insurgents routinely dispute official accounts of air strikes and clashes.
7342	APW_ENG_20070507.0512.LDC2009T13	Meanwhile, the Nordic truce monitors said the air force has increased airstrikes and spy plane activity over Tamil Tiger rebel-held areas in the north.
7343	APW_ENG_20070507.0512.LDC2009T13	Combat seems to have "shifted from the east to the areas closer to Kilinochchi, the main rebel-held town in the north," the Sri Lanka Monitoring Mission said in its weekly media statement.

7354	APW_ENG_20070509.1265.LDC2009T13	Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said Wednesday Congress would make a "huge mistake" if it fails to reinforce economic gains in Peru and Colombia by rejecting free trade agreements that U.S. officials have negotiated with the two countries.
7355	APW_ENG_20070509.1265.LDC2009T13	"We need to realize how far these partners of ours have come, and what trade agreements will mean for their people," Rice said in remarks prepared for a gathering of business leaders.
7356	APW_ENG_20070509.1265.LDC2009T13	But many Democrats are wary of bilateral trade agreements and may be in no mood to do favors for Colombia because of allegations that rightist paramilitary groups have penetrated the Colombian government.
7357	APW_ENG_20070509.1265.LDC2009T13	In Bogota, Vice President Francisco Santos said Tuesday his country "might need to re-evaluate its relationship with the United States" if the trade pact is jettisoned.
7358	APW_ENG_20070509.1265.LDC2009T13	The fate of the agreement was the key issue on Tuesday during discussions in Bogota involving visiting U.S. Deputy Secretary of State John Negroponte and Colombian officials.
7359	APW_ENG_20070509.1265.LDC2009T13	Rice said that just five years ago, Peru was still reeling from a legacy of destructive economic policies, while Colombia "teetered on the brink of failure.

7370	APW_ENG_20070514.1001.LDC2009T13	GRAND RAPIDS, Michigan 2007-05-14 16:51:59 UTC
7371	APW_ENG_20070514.1001.LDC2009T13	Dow Chemical Co. said Monday it plans to build multibillion- dollar production complexes in Saudi Arabia and China by entering into pacts with large energy companies in those nations.
7372	APW_ENG_20070514.1001.LDC2009T13	Dow Chemical has signed an agreement with Saudi Aramco, the world's largest supplier of energy, to enter into the final negotiation phase for the formation of a joint venture to build, own and operate a "world-scale" chemicals and plastics production complex near Ras Tanura in Saudi Arabia's Eastern Province.
7373	APW_ENG_20070514.1001.LDC2009T13	The Ras Tanura petrochemical joint venture would take years to complete and be operationally integrated with Saudi Aramco's Ras Tanura refinery complex and its Ju'aymah gas-processing plant, which would supply raw materials to be used in production at the new facility, Midland-based Dow said in a statement.
7374	APW_ENG_20070514.1001.LDC2009T13	The new business would produce a broad range of products, including ethylene and propylene, the building blocks used in the production of various plastics and chemical products.
7375	APW_ENG_20070514.1001.LDC2009T13	"These are basic chemicals that you use to make either commodity products or specialty products," Andrew N. Liveris, Dow's president and chief executive, said in a telephone interview from London.
7376	APW_ENG_20070514.1001.LDC2009T13	"That's the unusual part of the Aramco-Dow joint venture -- that we're going to actually put in place an ability to make our specialty products as well."
7377	APW_ENG_20070514.1001.LDC2009T13	The massive project would help expand Saudi Arabia's economic base, create jobs and promote economic diversification in the country, said Abdallah S. Jum'ah, president and CEO of Saudi Aramco.
7378	APW_ENG_20070514.1001.LDC2009T13	Dow and the Shenhua Group of China were to sign a cooperation agreement for conducting a detailed, two-year feasibility study for building a coal-to-chemicals complex in China's Shaanxi Province.
7379	APW_ENG_20070514.1001.LDC2009T13	The project would use "clean coal" technologies that convert coal to methanol to produce basic products such as ethylene and propylene, as well as other derivative products.
7380	APW_ENG_20070514.1001.LDC2009T13	Liveris said the project is in line with Dow's strategy to improve its competitive position in Asia "with locally produced products and solutions."
7381	APW_ENG_20070514.1001.LDC2009T13	"The building of the world-scale coal chemical plant jointly with Dow will make full use of the respective advantages of the two companies," said Chen Biting, chairman of Shenhua Group.
7382	APW_ENG_20070514.1001.LDC2009T13	"It is of great significance for the world to produce the oil substitute converted from coal and it is the case for China in particular."
7383	APW_ENG_20070514.1001.LDC2009T13	The feasibility study is expected to take about two years.
7384	APW_ENG_20070514.1001.LDC2009T13	The two companies then would put together a project-application report for submission to the Chinese government for approval.
7385	APW_ENG_20070514.1001.LDC2009T13	Liveris declined to say how much money Dow planned to spend on the two projects other than to describe the Saudi Aramco project as the larger of the two and that each would cost "multiple billions of dollars."

7392	APW_ENG_20070515.1038.LDC2009T13	President-elect Nicolas Sarkozy faced his first political hurdle even before taking office Wednesday, with members of his own conservative party irked by plans to include rival Socialists in a government spanning the left-right divide.
7393	APW_ENG_20070515.1038.LDC2009T13	Socialist Party leader Francois Hollande denounced the overtures as "depraved" and "seductive" maneuvers designed to increase Sarkozy's power.
7394	APW_ENG_20070515.1038.LDC2009T13	Former Prime Minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin stepped in Tuesday to try to lower rising temperatures in Sarkozy's UMP party, saying it was important that the new president "share his project with people from other horizons."
7395	APW_ENG_20070515.1038.LDC2009T13	Some members of the Union for a Popular Movement who helped the conservative candidate win election May 6 have grumbled at overtures in recent days to Socialists, apparently fearing leftists could squeeze loyalists out of prominent posts.
7396	APW_ENG_20070515.1038.LDC2009T13	Sarkozy's surprising pre-inaugural meetings with labor unions and some leading Socialists reflect his effort to distance himself from his one-time mentor, outgoing President Jacques Chirac, and the economic stagnation and social tensions left over from his 12-year tenure.
7397	APW_ENG_20070515.1038.LDC2009T13	Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin, a die-hard Chirac loyalist, presented the outgoing president with his resignation on Tuesday.
7398	APW_ENG_20070515.1038.LDC2009T13	Sarkozy is widely expected to name conservative four-time minister Francois Fillon, a close confidant, to succeed Villepin.
7399	APW_ENG_20070515.1038.LDC2009T13	The widely popular Bernard Kouchner, a former Socialist health minister and founder of the Nobel-prize winning organization Doctors Without Borders, is among those being considered as new foreign minister.
7400	APW_ENG_20070515.1038.LDC2009T13	On Tuesday afternoon, Anne Lauvergeon, head of the nuclear group Areva and once a top adviser of former Socialist President Francois Mitterrand, was seen entering Sarkozy's office.
7401	APW_ENG_20070515.1038.LDC2009T13	Sarkozy also continued consultations with unions.
7402	APW_ENG_20070515.1038.LDC2009T13	With a streamlined government of only 15 ministers, half of whom are likely to be women, there was little room to reward the faithful with ministries.
7403	APW_ENG_20070515.1038.LDC2009T13	Aides to Sarkozy have put the accent on competence, not loyalty.
7404	APW_ENG_20070515.1038.LDC2009T13	Patrick Devedjian -- who had been tapped as a potential minister in Sarkozy's Cabinet -- bristled at the suggestion of Socialists in government, insisting that "loyalty is not necessarily the opposite of competence."
7405	APW_ENG_20070515.1038.LDC2009T13	Sarkozy confidant Brice Hortefeux told colleagues Tuesday to cut out the complaining.
7406	APW_ENG_20070515.1038.LDC2009T13	"Nicolas Sarkozy never promised a post to anyone," Hortefeux said on RTL radio.
7407	APW_ENG_20070515.1038.LDC2009T13	Sarkozy, elected with a mandate to rejuvenate France, takes office Wednesday, replacing Chirac, who was to address the nation Tuesday evening with a televised farewell message.
7408	APW_ENG_20070515.1038.LDC2009T13	Sarkozy was expected to name his prime minister on Thursday.

7410	APW_ENG_20070515.1038.LDC2009T13	The full government was expected to be announced within days, possibly as early as Thursday.
7411	APW_ENG_20070515.1038.LDC2009T13	The Socialist Party, whose candidate Segolene Royal lost to Sarkozy, was among those protesting his reaching out to the left, just as it tries to bolster its profile ahead of June legislative elections.
7412	APW_ENG_20070515.1038.LDC2009T13	Hollande, the party leader, said he spoke with Kouchner to warn him that "if he accepts, he will be in a government of the right, a majority of the right and have friends on the right .... Everyone must face his own conscience and (code of) ethics."
7413	APW_ENG_20070515.1038.LDC2009T13	Speaking to reporters, Hollande denounced the bid to lure Socialists to the government as a move by Sarkozy to increase his power and control, saying Sarkozy "backs away from no operation -- seduction, depravity, intimidation, pressure."
7414	APW_ENG_20070515.1038.LDC2009T13	Former Socialist Justice Minister Elisabeth Guigou accused Sarkozy of trying to break the left ahead of the legislative vote next month.

7448	APW_ENG_20070522.0136.LDC2009T13	Hawaii and the central Pacific Ocean face a slightly below average hurricane season this summer with just two or three tropical cyclones expected, the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration predicted.
7449	APW_ENG_20070522.0136.LDC2009T13	But officials warned residents Monday that a big storm could still hit the islands.
7450	APW_ENG_20070522.0136.LDC2009T13	With sea surface temperatures colder than average, scientists at NOAA's Central Pacific Hurricane Center in Hawaii predicted possible La Nina conditions resulting in less tropical cyclone activity, which covers tropical depressions, tropical storms and hurricanes over the central Pacific.
7451	APW_ENG_20070522.0136.LDC2009T13	Those conditions and the overall reduction in hurricane activity in that region since 1995 led to the cooled-down prediction for the June-November season, said Jim Weyman, director of NOAA's Central Pacific Hurricane Center, at a news conference.
7452	APW_ENG_20070522.0136.LDC2009T13	But he warned against not being prepared.
7453	APW_ENG_20070522.0136.LDC2009T13	"When I give a slightly below average forecast it always troubles me because people always think they don't have to worry, and that is not the message we want to take," Weyman said.
7454	APW_ENG_20070522.0136.LDC2009T13	"The message is it only takes that one to cause tremendous devastation."
7455	APW_ENG_20070522.0136.LDC2009T13	The islands get an average of 4.5 tropical cyclones a year and one hurricane about every 15 years.
7456	APW_ENG_20070522.0136.LDC2009T13	Last year, the central Pacific had five tropical cyclones after NOAA predicted two to three.
7457	APW_ENG_20070522.0136.LDC2009T13	The last hurricane to hit Hawaii was in 1992 when Iniki killed six people and caused $2.5 billion in damage.
7458	APW_ENG_20070522.0136.LDC2009T13	Weyman said the Central Pacific Hurricane Center will now use Hawaiian names for tropical storms and hurricanes.
7459	APW_ENG_20070522.0136.LDC2009T13	The next one will be called Kika, which means strong and energetic.

7474	APW_ENG_20070526.0745.LDC2009T13	The doping scandal in German cycling spread to the amateur ranks Saturday when a doctor for the country's Olympic team admitted providing performance-enhancing testosterone to riders as far back as 1980.
7475	APW_ENG_20070526.0745.LDC2009T13	Georg Huber, who worked on six Olympic teams, was suspended by both German cycling authorities and the University of Freiburg.
7476	APW_ENG_20070526.0745.LDC2009T13	Like the two doctors who provided EPO to Team Telekom riders, he worked at the college clinic.
7477	APW_ENG_20070526.0745.LDC2009T13	Two former riders triggered his resignation, naming him in a story in Saturday's Suddeutsche Zeitung and claiming doping in German cycling was widespread in amateur ranks long before the Team Telekom scandal.
7478	APW_ENG_20070526.0745.LDC2009T13	Several former Team Telekom riders including Erik Zabel, Rolf Aldag and 1996 Tour de France winner Bjarne Riss admitted this week that they used blood-doping EPO during the 1990s.
7479	APW_ENG_20070526.0745.LDC2009T13	Christian Henn, one of the Team Telekom riders who acknowledged EPO use, said in the newspaper story that doping began while he was on a youth national team.
7480	APW_ENG_20070526.0745.LDC2009T13	"It was made clear to us they were doping in the East (the former Soviet bloc), so we had also had to take something," Henn said.
7481	APW_ENG_20070526.0745.LDC2009T13	"The whole thing took place in close cooperation with Huber."
7482	APW_ENG_20070526.0745.LDC2009T13	Peter Weibel, coach of Germany's under-23 national, was also accused of involvement by one of his former riders.
7483	APW_ENG_20070526.0745.LDC2009T13	Joerg Mueller said the coach personally gave him performance-enhancing drugs at a 1987 street race in France.
7484	APW_ENG_20070526.0745.LDC2009T13	"I don't know what -- injections too," said Mueller, now 39.
7485	APW_ENG_20070526.0745.LDC2009T13	Weibel will be questioned Monday by the German cycling federation.
7486	APW_ENG_20070526.0745.LDC2009T13	"We will discuss the situation with him and in that light decide over further consequences," a federation statement said.
7487	APW_ENG_20070526.0745.LDC2009T13	The 64-year-old Huber acknowledged he gave the cyclists testosterone between 1980 and 1990.
7488	APW_ENG_20070526.0745.LDC2009T13	He has been head doctor for the German paralympics team and worked for the German skiing federation.
7489	APW_ENG_20070526.0745.LDC2009T13	The two other University of Freiburg doctors suspected of providing the EPO to Team Telekom, Andreas Schmid and Lothar Heinrich, have been suspended.
7490	APW_ENG_20070526.0745.LDC2009T13	They are threatened with a lifetime ban from their profession.
7491	APW_ENG_20070526.0745.LDC2009T13	The federation also said it has started an internal investigation and won't take action against Zabel until it is completed.
7492	APW_ENG_20070526.0745.LDC2009T13	He is the only active cyclist to admit to using EPO while with Team Telekom, now called T-Mobile.
7493	APW_ENG_20070526.0745.LDC2009T13	The only major figures connected to the 1990s Team Telekom not to have admitted being part of the doping are 1997 Tour de France winner Jan Ullrich and Walter Godefroot, the team's manager at the time.

7497	APW_ENG_20070527.0310.LDC2009T13	A flash flood swept away a group of hikers alongside a river in southern Greece, killing at least five people, police said Sunday.
7498	APW_ENG_20070527.0310.LDC2009T13	Three others were missing.
7499	APW_ENG_20070527.0310.LDC2009T13	The dead were only identified as four women and a man, all Greek nationals.
7500	APW_ENG_20070527.0310.LDC2009T13	Police said the incident occurred late Saturday as a group of 18 Greek hikers, including two guides, were walking along the banks of the Lousios River, near the village of Dimitsana in the western Peloponnese, about 180 kilometers (110 miles) southwest of Athens.
7501	APW_ENG_20070527.0310.LDC2009T13	A flash flood, caused by heavy rains, struck the group as they were trying to cross the river and swept eight people away, police said.

7504	APW_ENG_20070530.0738.LDC2009T13	SRINAGAR, India 2007-05-30 13:34:22 UTC
7505	APW_ENG_20070530.0738.LDC2009T13	An Australian geologist said Wednesday that high magnitude earthquakes are likely to hit the Himalayan territory of Kashmir, but the frequency may not be as high as in the past.
7506	APW_ENG_20070530.0738.LDC2009T13	Clifford David Ollier, professor emeritus at the University of Western Australia, said more scientific and fundamental research was needed to clearly determine the probability of future tectonic events in the region.
7507	APW_ENG_20070530.0738.LDC2009T13	However, the Himalayan region lacked basic scientific research in seismology, Ollier said.
7508	APW_ENG_20070530.0738.LDC2009T13	"We need more fundamental information, which I believe is not available."
7509	APW_ENG_20070530.0738.LDC2009T13	Ollier was speaking at an institute in Srinagar, the summer capital of India's Jammu-Kashmir state, after visiting the earthquake-hit areas in the Indian portion of Kashmir.
7510	APW_ENG_20070530.0738.LDC2009T13	"I think there will be more earthquakes of high magnitude in this region," he said.
7511	APW_ENG_20070530.0738.LDC2009T13	Kashmir is divided between South Asian archrivals Pakistan and India.
7512	APW_ENG_20070530.0738.LDC2009T13	In 2005, both sides were struck by a magnitude 7.6 quake, killing more than 80,000 people and devastating hundreds of villages and towns, mostly in the Pakistan-controlled portion.
7513	APW_ENG_20070530.0738.LDC2009T13	"My study of past one year also shows that we're not safe of earthquakes," said M. I. Bhat, head of the Geology Department at University of Kashmir.
7514	APW_ENG_20070530.0738.LDC2009T13	"Unfortunately, we don't have worthwhile geological maps of Kashmir which could have acted as reference for research in active tectonic."
7515	APW_ENG_20070601.0485.LDC2009T13	Low chance of terrorists obtaining nukes, but governments must be vigilant, US expert says
7516	APW_ENG_20070601.0485.LDC2009T13	SINGAPORE 2007-06-01 08:58:20 UTC
7517	APW_ENG_20070601.0485.LDC2009T13	Terrorists have little chance of making a nuclear bomb, but governments must remain on guard against the possibility, a top U.S. expert said Friday.
7518	APW_ENG_20070601.0485.LDC2009T13	Only about 8 kilograms (17.6 pounds) of highly enriched uranium -- far too little to make a nuclear device -- is believed to have leaked into the global black market, said Mark Fitzpatrick, senior fellow for nonproliferation at the London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies.
7519	APW_ENG_20070601.0485.LDC2009T13	"This is the classic low-probability, high-consequence danger that governments must focus a great deal of attention" on, said Fitzpatrick, a former deputy assistant secretary for nonproliferation at the U.S. State Department.
7520	APW_ENG_20070601.0485.LDC2009T13	Fitzpatrick was speaking to reporters ahead of the IISS's annual Shangri-La Dialogue, a meeting of defense chiefs and scholars held in Singapore.
7521	APW_ENG_20070601.0485.LDC2009T13	A minimum of 20-25 kilograms (44-55 pounds) of weapons-grade uranium would be needed to make an implosion-type nuclear device, while four times that much would be needed to make a much simpler gun-type device, Fitzpatrick said.
7522	APW_ENG_20070601.0485.LDC2009T13	Amounts of uranium involved in most clandestine smuggling attempts are typically small, Fitzpatrick said, citing a sting operation on the Russia-Georgia border last year in which 100 grams (3.53 ounces) of uranium was recovered.
7523	APW_ENG_20070601.0485.LDC2009T13	"Probably it's not so easy to get hold of fissile material, but that doesn't mean complacency should rule.
7524	APW_ENG_20070601.0485.LDC2009T13	Maybe it's only the tip of the iceberg," Fitzpatrick said.
7525	APW_ENG_20070601.0485.LDC2009T13	Osama bin Laden's al-Qaida network has expressed interest in obtaining nuclear weapons while Iran, considered a major sponsor of Islamic terrorist groups by Washington, is in a deadlock with the West over its refusal to suspend uranium enrichment.
7526	APW_ENG_20070601.0485.LDC2009T13	Fears of nuclear weapons technology falling into terrorist hands were also stirred by investigations into the black market network of Pakistani scientist A.Q. Khan.
7527	APW_ENG_20070601.0485.LDC2009T13	That incident, in part, prompted the U.N. Security Council to adopt Resolution 1540 in April 2004, requiring all U.N. members to pass laws preventing terrorists and black marketeers from dealing in weapons of mass destruction, the materials to make them, and the missiles and other systems to deliver them.
7528	APW_ENG_20070601.0485.LDC2009T13	Fitzpatrick called the resolution a "good start," but said follow-through by states on implementing its requirements has been "weak to the point of negligence."
7529	APW_ENG_20070601.0485.LDC2009T13	While such defects must be addressed, the public should not be overly anxious about the possibility of a terrorist nuclear bomb, Fitzpatrick said.
7530	APW_ENG_20070601.0485.LDC2009T13	"Is it a kind of a risk that the public should be worrying about day-to-day?
7531	APW_ENG_20070601.0485.LDC2009T13	I would say not," said Fitzpatrick.
7532	APW_ENG_20070601.0485.LDC2009T13	"The probability is too low for people to be worrying about and keeping up at night.
7533	APW_ENG_20070601.0485.LDC2009T13	"But is it the kind of risk that governments should spend a great deal of attention trying to prevent?
7534	APW_ENG_20070601.0485.LDC2009T13	Absolutely," he said.

7536	APW_ENG_20070601.1299.LDC2009T13	BOSTON 2007-06-01 19:04:15 UTC
7537	APW_ENG_20070601.1299.LDC2009T13	The death of a defrocked priest who was about to go to trial on child rape charges has left his alleged victim feeling robbed of a chance for justice, the man said Friday.
7538	APW_ENG_20070601.1299.LDC2009T13	Anthony Laurano, 82, the former pastor of St. Mary's Church in Plymouth, died Sunday of natural causes.
7539	APW_ENG_20070601.1299.LDC2009T13	He was charged in 2005 in the 1991 rape of an 8-year-old boy.
7540	APW_ENG_20070601.1299.LDC2009T13	While he was awaiting trial, he was charged with molesting his mentally disabled neighbor in Hull, outraging members of the Survivors Network of Those Abused by Priests, who criticized the decision to allow him to remain free on bail on the earlier charges.
7541	APW_ENG_20070601.1299.LDC2009T13	Laurano's alleged victim in the 1991 case said he went to the police in 2005 after recovering repressed memories of being raped.
7542	APW_ENG_20070601.1299.LDC2009T13	Since then, he has been waiting for Laurano's trial to tell his story.
7543	APW_ENG_20070601.1299.LDC2009T13	"That was my one chance.
7544	APW_ENG_20070601.1299.LDC2009T13	It was not for me, it was for the little kid I left behind," he said in a phone interview Friday.
7545	APW_ENG_20070601.1299.LDC2009T13	"Now I won't have that chance."
7546	APW_ENG_20070601.1299.LDC2009T13	Laurano retired from active service in 1995 and was placed on administrative leave by the Boston Archdiocese in 2002 at the height of the clergy sex abuse scandal, which forced the resignation of Cardinal Bernard Law after hundreds of people came forward and said they had been sexually abused by priests when they were children.
7547	APW_ENG_20070601.1299.LDC2009T13	In March, Laurano was defrocked by the Vatican, meaning he could no longer function as a priest.
7548	APW_ENG_20070601.1299.LDC2009T13	Laurano faced two counts of child rape for allegedly raping the boy twice in one day in the sacristy of St. Mary's.
7549	APW_ENG_20070601.1299.LDC2009T13	The trial was expected to begin later this month.
7550	APW_ENG_20070601.1299.LDC2009T13	The alleged victim, who is now 24 and still lives in Plymouth, said he passes by the church every day and thinks about what happened to him there.
7551	APW_ENG_20070601.1299.LDC2009T13	He said he was angry Laurano's trial was repeatedly delayed.
7552	APW_ENG_20070601.1299.LDC2009T13	"I can't help but feel that the justice system let me down ... not because a man was innocent, but because he cheated facing his (actions) in death," he said in a statement he wrote after learning of Laurano's death.
7553	APW_ENG_20070601.1299.LDC2009T13	The Associated Press does not identify victims of sexual abuse without their permission.
7554	APW_ENG_20070601.1299.LDC2009T13	Laurano was one of the priests shown in the PBS documentary, "Hand of God," made by the brother of a man who was allegedly molested in the 1960s by the late Rev. Joseph Birmingham, who was accused by more than 50 men of sexually abusing them as children.
7555	APW_ENG_20070601.1299.LDC2009T13	Laurano's attorney, Elliot Weinstein, said Laurano maintained his innocence and was confident a jury would have found him not guilty.

7557	APW_ENG_20070602.0097.LDC2009T13	OTTAWA 2007-06-02 00:59:13 UTC
7558	APW_ENG_20070602.0097.LDC2009T13	Canada, which has been accused of being responsible for 20 to 25 percent of all pirated movies, is considering legislation that would make it a criminal offense to record movies in theaters.
7559	APW_ENG_20070602.0097.LDC2009T13	Last month, Warner Bros. threatened to cancel all of its advance screenings in Canada and accused the country of being at the forefront of the piracy market.
7560	APW_ENG_20070602.0097.LDC2009T13	It is currently not a criminal offense in Canada to make recordings of movies in theaters for personal use.
7561	APW_ENG_20070602.0097.LDC2009T13	Under a new bill introduced Friday, recording a movie without permission can bring up to two years in jail, while taping a film for later sale or rental could carry a five-year penalty.
7562	APW_ENG_20070602.0097.LDC2009T13	The movie industry has lobbied for years for a crackdown, saying piracy costs it US$6 billion (euro4.5 billion) dollars a year.
7563	APW_ENG_20070602.0097.LDC2009T13	In a meeting Wednesday, Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper promised California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger that Canada would crack down on piracy.
7564	APW_ENG_20070602.0097.LDC2009T13	Canadian Heritage Minister Bev Oda said the legislation averts a Warner Bros. threat to cancel Canadian preview showings of likely summer hits such as the latest Harry Potter sequel.
7565	APW_ENG_20070602.0097.LDC2009T13	Oda said she has been told that Canada may be responsible for 20 to 25 percent of all pirated movies.

7579	APW_ENG_20070609.0341.LDC2009T13	Lebanon's army on Saturday pounded al-Qaida-inspired Islamic militants hiding in a Palestinian refugee camp in renewed heavy clashes following a few days of intermittent fighting.
7580	APW_ENG_20070609.0341.LDC2009T13	Black smoke billowed from the Nahr el-Bared camp in northern Lebanon where witnesses reported some of the heaviest army shelling since June 1, when the Lebanese army -- using tanks and artillery -- launched an offensive to drive the Fatah Islam militants from their positions inside the settlement.
7581	APW_ENG_20070609.0341.LDC2009T13	Ambulances were seen rushing to the area of the camp, and security officials said 13 soldiers were wounded in the fighting Saturday morning.
7582	APW_ENG_20070609.0341.LDC2009T13	The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not allowed to give official statements.
7583	APW_ENG_20070609.0341.LDC2009T13	The army sent heavy reinforcements -- including armored carriers and special combat units -- that were spotted heading toward the camp.
7584	APW_ENG_20070609.0341.LDC2009T13	The main road linking Tripoli with the province of Akkar and the Syrian border was closed Saturday for the first time in several days.
7585	APW_ENG_20070609.0341.LDC2009T13	It was not immediately clear if the army intended to make a final push toward the camp in its attempt to uproot the militants hiding there.
7586	APW_ENG_20070609.0341.LDC2009T13	Local and Arab television stations billed it as a major army assault on militants inside the camp, but a senior Fatah Islam commander denied the reports and said fighters were holding their ground.
7587	APW_ENG_20070609.0341.LDC2009T13	"We are steadfast and, God willing, we will not retreat for one moment.
7588	APW_ENG_20070609.0341.LDC2009T13	Let them (army) advance if they want.
7589	APW_ENG_20070609.0341.LDC2009T13	... We are on the front lines across from them," Abu Hureira, Fatah Islam's deputy commander, told The Associated Press by telephone from inside the camp.
7590	APW_ENG_20070609.0341.LDC2009T13	Abu Hureira, whose real name is Shehab al-Qaddour, dismissed as "rumors" media reports that he and Fatah Islam leader Shaker Youssef al-Absi, were wounded.
7591	APW_ENG_20070609.0341.LDC2009T13	He said some fighters were "lightly" injured "but it's nothing compared to them," he said, referring to Lebanese army casualties.
7592	APW_ENG_20070609.0341.LDC2009T13	He said the militants were still fighting with the same tenacity, claiming that Fatah Islam fighters attacked an army position on the northern edge of the camp Friday and seizing weapons from Lebanese army soldiers.
7593	APW_ENG_20070609.0341.LDC2009T13	Tensions in Lebanon have been high since fighting broke out May 20 between the army and Fatah Islam militants in Nahr el-Bared.
7594	APW_ENG_20070609.0341.LDC2009T13	Fears of spreading chaos have also been sparked by clashes at another Palestinian refugee camp, Ein el-Hilweh in the south, and several bombings in the Beirut area.
7595	APW_ENG_20070609.0341.LDC2009T13	In a statement issued Friday, the army said it was "gradually taking control of the terrorists' positions" in Nahr el-Bared to end this "abnormal phenomenon ... imposed on Lebanon."
7596	APW_ENG_20070609.0341.LDC2009T13	The statement did not say how many militant positions were overtaken so far.
7597	APW_ENG_20070609.0341.LDC2009T13	More than 120 people, including at least 60 Fatah Islam militants, 46 soldiers and 20 civilians, have been reported killed in the fighting -- the worst internal violence in Lebanon since the 1975-90 civil war.
7598	APW_ENG_20070609.0341.LDC2009T13	Recent civilian casualties are not known because the camp has been closed to journalists and aid workers for days.
7599	APW_ENG_20070609.0341.LDC2009T13	Though most of Nahr el-Bared's residents have fled, thousands remain trapped inside.
7600	APW_ENG_20070610.0182.LDC2009T13	New York medical examiner says muscle cream killed teen runner
7601	APW_ENG_20070610.0182.LDC2009T13	NEW YORK 2007-06-10 05:58:07 UTC
7602	APW_ENG_20070610.0182.LDC2009T13	A medical examiner blamed a 17-year-old track star's death on the use of too much anti-inflammatory muscle cream, the kind used to soothe aching legs after exercise.
7603	APW_ENG_20070610.0182.LDC2009T13	Arielle Newman, a cross-country runner at Notre Dame Academy on New York's Staten Island, died after her body absorbed high levels of methyl salicylate, an anti-inflammatory found in sports creams such as Bengay and Icy Hot, the New York City medical examiner said Friday.
7604	APW_ENG_20070610.0182.LDC2009T13	The medical examiner's spokeswoman, Ellen Borakove, said the teen used "topical medication to excess."
7605	APW_ENG_20070610.0182.LDC2009T13	She said it was the first time that her office had reported a death from using a sports cream.
7606	APW_ENG_20070610.0182.LDC2009T13	In addition to spreading the muscle cream on her legs between track meets, Newman was using adhesive pads containing the anti- inflammatory, plus an unspecified third product containing the chemical, Borakove said.
7607	APW_ENG_20070610.0182.LDC2009T13	The products were used and the chemical absorbed over time, she said.
7608	APW_ENG_20070610.0182.LDC2009T13	Newman, who garnered numerous track awards, died April 3.
7609	APW_ENG_20070610.0182.LDC2009T13	She had gone to a party the night before, then returned home and spent hours talking with her mother.
7610	APW_ENG_20070610.0182.LDC2009T13	Methyl salicylate poisoning is unusual, and deaths from high levels of the chemical are rare.
7611	APW_ENG_20070610.0182.LDC2009T13	"Chronic use is more dangerous than one-time use," Edward Arsura, chairman of medicine at Richmond University Medical Center, told the Staten Island Advance on Friday.
7612	APW_ENG_20070610.0182.LDC2009T13	"Exercise and heat can accentuate absorption."
7613	APW_ENG_20070610.0182.LDC2009T13	Dr. Ronald Grelsamer, of Mount Sinai Medical Center, said Newman had a very abnormal amount of methyl salicylate in her body.
7614	APW_ENG_20070610.0182.LDC2009T13	"She either lathered herself with it, or used way too much, or she used a normal amount and an abnormal percentage was absorbed into her body," he said.
7615	APW_ENG_20070610.0182.LDC2009T13	Her mother, Alice Newman, said she still could not believe her daughter's death was caused by a sports cream.
7616	APW_ENG_20070610.0182.LDC2009T13	"I am scrupulous about my children's health," she told the Advance newspaper.
7617	APW_ENG_20070610.0182.LDC2009T13	"I did not think an over-the-counter product could be unsafe."
7618	APW_ENG_20070610.0182.LDC2009T13	Johnson &amp
7619	APW_ENG_20070610.0182.LDC2009T13	Johnson, the makers of Bengay, expressed sympathy for the family and reminded consumers about "the importance of reading the label on this and all over-the-counter medicines to ensure safe and proper use," in a statement released Saturday.
7620	APW_ENG_20070610.0182.LDC2009T13	The label on Ultra Strength Bengay says the product should be applied no more than three or four times daily and consumers should stop and see a doctor if the condition worsens or symptoms persist for more than a week, spokeswoman Meghan Marschall said.

7667	APW_ENG_20070613.0578.LDC2009T13	GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip 2007-06-13 10:17:57 UTC
7668	APW_ENG_20070613.0578.LDC2009T13	Fierce battles over key security positions spread to central Gaza early Wednesday, with Hamas fighters wresting control of the coastal strip's main north-south road -- and putting themselves in position to cut off reinforcements to beleaguered Fatah forces.
7669	APW_ENG_20070613.0578.LDC2009T13	Gunmen also fought for control of high-rise buildings in Gaza City that serve as sniper positions.
7670	APW_ENG_20070613.0578.LDC2009T13	Six militants died in clashes near the besieged house of a senior Fatah commander in Gaza City, in addition to four killed there on Tuesday, Hamas said.
7671	APW_ENG_20070613.0578.LDC2009T13	Two other people died of wounds sustained in earlier fighting.
7672	APW_ENG_20070613.0578.LDC2009T13	A mortar shell hit the home of a deputy Cabinet minister from Hamas in the nearby Shati refugee camp, setting it aflame, security officials said.
7673	APW_ENG_20070613.0578.LDC2009T13	No one was injured, and the official was not at home, officials said.
7674	APW_ENG_20070613.0578.LDC2009T13	Violence in Gaza between the two factions, which nominally share power in the Palestinian government, has rapidly spiraled in the direction of all-out civil war, with more than 50 reported killed since Monday.
7675	APW_ENG_20070613.0578.LDC2009T13	Hamas has systematically taken control of security positions in the north and south, apparently leaving the main battle for the strip's security and political nerve center in Gaza City for last.
7676	APW_ENG_20070613.0578.LDC2009T13	On Wednesday afternoon, Hamas demanded Fatah-allied security forces in the north relinquish their weapons by 7 p.m. (1600 GMT) Friday, or risk having them taken by force.
7677	APW_ENG_20070613.0578.LDC2009T13	The ultimatum was delivered in text messages and radio announcements.
7678	APW_ENG_20070613.0578.LDC2009T13	Shops in Gaza City were shuttered tight Wednesday, and streets were mostly empty as terrified residents huddled in homes that could at any moment turn into battlegrounds, The U.N. Relief and Works Agency announced it couldn't distribute food to the 30 percent of the Gaza Strip that relies on international food aid.
7679	APW_ENG_20070613.0578.LDC2009T13	The mounting bloodshed touched off protests in two main Gaza towns.
7680	APW_ENG_20070613.0578.LDC2009T13	Several hundred tribal leaders, women, children and Islamic Jihad militants turned out in Gaza City for a protest initiated by Egyptian mediators.
7681	APW_ENG_20070613.0578.LDC2009T13	Some demonstrators scattered after masked Hamas gunmen fired in the air, but others pushed on, carrying Palestinian flags and shouting, "Do not shoot" and "national unity" over a loudspeaker.
7682	APW_ENG_20070613.0578.LDC2009T13	Witnesses said Hamas gunmen shot at the protesters as they approached the besieged house of the Fatah commander from the Bakr family in Gaza City, trapping the demonstrators.
7683	APW_ENG_20070613.0578.LDC2009T13	Protester Bilal Qurashali said he saw a man get shot in the head.
7684	APW_ENG_20070613.0578.LDC2009T13	"We are unable to get out.
7685	APW_ENG_20070613.0578.LDC2009T13	The place is closed," he said.
7686	APW_ENG_20070613.0578.LDC2009T13	Health officials said 15 protesters were injured by bullets -- five of them in the head -- and were brought to the hospital in civilian cars because ambulances couldn't navigate the heavy fire.
7687	APW_ENG_20070613.0578.LDC2009T13	Demonstrators had hoped the stature of the tribal leaders leading the protest would protect them, he said.
7688	APW_ENG_20070613.0578.LDC2009T13	Separately, Hamas gunmen opened fire from a high-rise building at about 1,000 protesters in the southern town of Khan Younis, injuring one and breaking up the protest.
7689	APW_ENG_20070613.0578.LDC2009T13	And a Fatah-affiliated officer was shot to death at the National Security compound in the town.
7690	APW_ENG_20070613.0578.LDC2009T13	Confrontations have turned increasingly brutal in recent days, with some killed execution-style in the streets, others in hospital shootouts or thrown off rooftops.
7691	APW_ENG_20070613.0578.LDC2009T13	Both sides have been arming themselves in recent weeks, smuggling weapons through tunnels under the Gaza-Egypt border.
7692	APW_ENG_20070613.0578.LDC2009T13	On Tuesday, Hamas gunmen scored a key victory when they overran the headquarters of a Fatah-allied security force in northern Gaza.
7693	APW_ENG_20070613.0578.LDC2009T13	For hours, about 200 Hamas fighters fired mortars, rocket- propelled grenades and machine guns at the compound, where some 500 Fatah loyalists were holed up and returned fire.
7694	APW_ENG_20070613.0578.LDC2009T13	Thirty-five jeeploads of Fatah fighters were sent as reinforcements, but never made it through Hamas roadblocks.
7695	APW_ENG_20070613.0578.LDC2009T13	After nightfall, Hamas seized control.
7696	APW_ENG_20070613.0578.LDC2009T13	Hamas reported another strategic win Wednesday, saying it seized a Fatah post on the main north-south road, where security forces often stopped cars carrying Hamas loyalists.
7697	APW_ENG_20070613.0578.LDC2009T13	Hamas said it brought a bulldozer to flatten the post, made up of a mobile home and several shacks.
7698	APW_ENG_20070613.0578.LDC2009T13	Hamas also seized control of a Fatah post on Gaza's coastal road -- another main artery for reinforcing Fatah troops.
7699	APW_ENG_20070613.0578.LDC2009T13	Hamas and Fatah have waged a power struggle in fits and spurts since Hamas won parliament elections last year, ending four decades of Fatah rule.
7700	APW_ENG_20070613.0578.LDC2009T13	On Tuesday, Hamas signaled it was moving into a decisive phase.
7701	APW_ENG_20070613.0578.LDC2009T13	It ignored pleas by Abbas and exasperated Egyptian mediators to honor a cease-fire, and appeared to be moving ahead according to a plan.
7702	APW_ENG_20070613.0578.LDC2009T13	In contrast, Fatah commanders complained they were not given clear orders by Abbas to fight back and that they had no central command.
7703	APW_ENG_20070613.0578.LDC2009T13	Fatah's strongman in Gaza, Mohammed Dahlan, has spent the last few weeks in Cairo for treatment of a knee injury.
7704	APW_ENG_20070613.0578.LDC2009T13	Other leading Fatah officials left Gaza for the West Bank after previous rounds of bloodshed.
7705	APW_ENG_20070613.0578.LDC2009T13	"There's a difference between leading on the ground and leading by mobile phone," police Col. Nasser Khaldi said of Dahlan's absence.
7706	APW_ENG_20070613.0578.LDC2009T13	"Hamas is just taking over our positions.
7707	APW_ENG_20070613.0578.LDC2009T13	There are no orders."
7708	APW_ENG_20070613.0578.LDC2009T13	The power struggle escalated further Tuesday when Fatah suspended the activities of its ministers in the government it shares with Hamas.
7709	APW_ENG_20070613.0578.LDC2009T13	In an emergency meeting in the West Bank, Fatah warned it would pull out of the government if the fighting doesn't stop, said Nabil Abu Rdeneh, an aide to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, of Fatah.
7710	APW_ENG_20070613.0578.LDC2009T13	There was concern that fighting might spread to the West Bank, where Fatah has the upper hand.
7711	APW_ENG_20070613.0578.LDC2009T13	Late Tuesday, Fatah gunmen wounded four Hamas activists in the West Bank city of Nablus, Fatah said in a statement.
7712	APW_ENG_20070613.0578.LDC2009T13	On Wednesday, unidentified gunmen opened fire at a Hamas school in the West Bank city of Ramallah, security officials said.
7713	APW_ENG_20070613.0578.LDC2009T13	No one was injured.
7714	APW_ENG_20070613.0578.LDC2009T13	Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert proposed stationing international forces along the Gaza Strip's volatile border with Egypt to prevent arms from reaching Palestinian militants, including Hamas.
7715	APW_ENG_20070613.0578.LDC2009T13	However, he ruled out assistance to Abbas' forces.
7716	APW_ENG_20070613.0578.LDC2009T13	The U.S. State Department, warning of a "very dangerous security situation" in Gaza, advised journalists not to travel there and urged any American journalists there to leave.
7717	APW_ENG_20070614.1533.LDC2009T13	France suspends use of type of cancer radiotherapy machines after malfunctions reported
7718	APW_ENG_20070614.1533.LDC2009T13	PARIS 2007-06-14 19:52:22 UTC
7719	APW_ENG_20070614.1533.LDC2009T13	A series of problems with radiation machines used to treat brain cancer sufferers -- with malfunctioning machines and some patients receiving overdoses -- is raising questions around France about the safety of the treatment.
7720	APW_ENG_20070614.1533.LDC2009T13	The Health Ministry this week ordered half the country's brain tumor radiotherapy machines suspended indefinitely following a warning from the manufacturer, Brainlab, that they were not targeting properly.
7721	APW_ENG_20070614.1533.LDC2009T13	Some 550 similar machines from the company, based in Munich, Germany, are in use worldwide -- the largest number of them in the United States, according to Brainlab founder and chief executive officer Stefan Vilsmeier.
7722	APW_ENG_20070614.1533.LDC2009T13	He said the problem stems from a rare combination of components and is only believed to affect seven of the machines: four in France, two in the United States and one in Spain.
7723	APW_ENG_20070614.1533.LDC2009T13	He would not name the hospitals outside France involved, but said they and government health authorities in the U.S. and Spain had been contacted, and that Brainlab was leaving it up to them to inform their patients of the malfunction.
7724	APW_ENG_20070614.1533.LDC2009T13	Another Brainlab official said the U.S. hospitals were in Washington state and Ohio.
7725	APW_ENG_20070614.1533.LDC2009T13	Dr. Georges Noel, a radiotherapy expert at the Paul Strauss cancer center in Strasbourg, France, says this treatment is reserved for patients who cannot undergo an operation.
7726	APW_ENG_20070614.1533.LDC2009T13	If the tumor cannot be removed by surgery, radiotherapy can provide comparable results, Noel said.
7727	APW_ENG_20070614.1533.LDC2009T13	For these patients, radiology "is the most effective alternative," he said.
7728	APW_ENG_20070614.1533.LDC2009T13	While other treatments for these patients are available, none provides results as effective as radiotherapy, Noel explained in an e-mail message.
7729	APW_ENG_20070614.1533.LDC2009T13	Noel said that the machine malfunctions were potentially harmful for patients.
7730	APW_ENG_20070614.1533.LDC2009T13	"A mistargeted machine could irradiate healthy brain tissue.
7731	APW_ENG_20070614.1533.LDC2009T13	... It could kill healthy tissue," Noel said.
7732	APW_ENG_20070614.1533.LDC2009T13	Whether this would have a large or small effect on the patient depends on the part of the brain affected, he said.
7733	APW_ENG_20070614.1533.LDC2009T13	The Brainlab case has raised concern because it is the latest of several cases involving brain cancer radiation treatment in hospitals around France dating back to 2004.
7734	APW_ENG_20070614.1533.LDC2009T13	In the latest incident, Brainlab alerted the four French hospitals directly June 7, after it identified a calibration error in a machine in Spain, Vilsmeier said.
7735	APW_ENG_20070614.1533.LDC2009T13	That machine has not yet been used on patients.
7736	APW_ENG_20070614.1533.LDC2009T13	The problem was identified after 145 patients received an improper dose of radiation from Brainlab equipment in Toulouse in southern France in April.
7737	APW_ENG_20070614.1533.LDC2009T13	It has not yet been determined whether it was an underdose or an overdose, the French Nuclear Safety Authority said.
7738	APW_ENG_20070614.1533.LDC2009T13	Following that incident, Brainlab, in conjunction with two French regulatory bodies, began a nationwide assessment of all Brainlab machines in use, and detected the targeting problem.
7739	APW_ENG_20070614.1533.LDC2009T13	The two incidents, however, were not connected, the Health Ministry said in a statement Monday.
7740	APW_ENG_20070614.1533.LDC2009T13	The ministry responded with an order on Sunday for all four hospitals using the identified Brainlab equipment to suspend their activities.
7741	APW_ENG_20070614.1533.LDC2009T13	Four other brain tumor radiotherapy machines, not made by Brainlab, in operation elsewhere in France were not affected.
7742	APW_ENG_20070614.1533.LDC2009T13	Radiotherapy treatment involves a one-time blast by a high-energy X-Ray that is aimed from several sources and focused on one point to kill the tumor.
7743	APW_ENG_20070614.1533.LDC2009T13	It typically has a margin of error of 0.8 millimeters when used on brain tumors, but when an older software used to map the brain is combined with a newer aiming apparatus, that margin can increase, Vilsmeier said in a telephone interview.
7744	APW_ENG_20070614.1533.LDC2009T13	In the malfunctioning French machines, the margin was found to have increased to 1.25 millimeters, Brainlab said in a statement.
7745	APW_ENG_20070614.1533.LDC2009T13	"We don't expect any problems with the patients," said Vilsmeier, because a doctor will typically use a safety margin of 1 to 3 millimeters (0.04 inches to 0.12 inches).
7746	APW_ENG_20070614.1533.LDC2009T13	"This security margin is always used to avoid critical organs: very important parts of the brain such as those that control sight," said Dr. Christian Carrie, coordinator of radiotherapy at the Leon Berard Cancer Centre in Lyon.
7747	APW_ENG_20070614.1533.LDC2009T13	Carrie said that with a security margin, "we cannot be sure, but we can hope" to avoid killing healthy brain tissue "even if there is a problem with the targeting of 1 millimeter."
7748	APW_ENG_20070614.1533.LDC2009T13	Four hospitals, in Nancy, Tours, Montpellier and Paris, shut down their radiotherapy machines Monday and an analysis of the machines has begun.
7749	APW_ENG_20070614.1533.LDC2009T13	The hospitals have also begun the process of tracking down all patients who may have received treatment from the malfunctioning machines, a number that may top 620, reported Le Parisien newspaper.
7750	APW_ENG_20070614.1533.LDC2009T13	Brainlab is offering a software update that should take care of the problem, Vilsmeier said.
7751	APW_ENG_20070614.1533.LDC2009T13	In 2004 and 2005, 24 patients in Epinal received as much as a 30 percent overdose of radiation while undergoing prostate cancer treatment.
7752	APW_ENG_20070614.1533.LDC2009T13	Four of these patients died, and their families are suing the hospitals, claiming that the deaths were a result of the overdoses.
7753	APW_ENG_20070614.1533.LDC2009T13	A 32-year-old woman died of complications after receiving a radiation treatment to an area 10 times the size she should have, in Lyon in 2004.
7754	APW_ENG_20070614.1533.LDC2009T13	In both the Epinal and Lyon incidents, hospitals blamed the problems on human error.

7757	APW_ENG_20070615.1162.LDC2009T13	Hamas on Friday condemned the appointment of political independent Salam Fayyad as the new Palestinian prime minister as a "coup."
7758	APW_ENG_20070615.1162.LDC2009T13	President Mahmoud Abbas announced the appointment in the West Bank, a day after Hamas defeated forces loyal to Abbas' Fatah movement and took control of the Gaza Strip.
7759	APW_ENG_20070615.1162.LDC2009T13	Fayyad, an economist who is well-respected by the international community, will replace Ismail Haniyeh of Hamas, who was fired by Abbas on Thursday.
7760	APW_ENG_20070615.1162.LDC2009T13	In Gaza, Hamas spokesman Ismail Ridwan accused Abbas of taking "hasty and illegal steps" meant to please Israel and the United States.
7761	APW_ENG_20070615.1162.LDC2009T13	He said the appointment will divide the Palestinians.
7762	APW_ENG_20070615.1162.LDC2009T13	"This is a political coup and it has serious consequences," he said.

7769	APW_ENG_20070617.0159.LDC2009T13	Another suspicious device was found hidden in a nearby planter, and two threatening letters were sent to the school, authorities said.
7770	APW_ENG_20070617.0159.LDC2009T13	Yung attended the university in 2002 and 2003, and took summer session classes as recently as 2006, authorities said.

7780	APW_ENG_20070621.0078.LDC2009T13	Nearly a million visitors trek every year to the cemetery overlooking Omaha Beach, one of the two landing points where U.S. troops stormed ashore on D-Day -- June 6, 1944 -- and helped the Allies rid the menace of Nazi Germany over Europe.
7781	APW_ENG_20070621.0078.LDC2009T13	Six years in the making, the new center was inaugurated recently by U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates for the 63rd anniversary of the start of "Operation Overlord" that helped end the war.
7782	APW_ENG_20070621.0078.LDC2009T13	"We build memorials like this to remind us of the past.
7783	APW_ENG_20070621.0078.LDC2009T13	So that successive generations will know the enormous cost of freedom," Gates said at the ceremony.
7784	APW_ENG_20070621.0078.LDC2009T13	Designers faced a delicate task balancing the desire to educate while not overshadowing sacrifices of nearly 10,000 Americans buried nearby.
7785	APW_ENG_20070621.0078.LDC2009T13	The US$30 million (euro22.4 million) visitor center is purposely understated, with most of the 10,000-square-feet (929-square- meters) of display space underground, though it is now the entryway for tourists onto the cemetery's manicured lawn.
7786	APW_ENG_20070621.0078.LDC2009T13	"The cemetery has always had this extremely powerful emotional component," said Macarena Aristegui of the American Battle Monuments Commission, which runs the cemetery and memorial.

7788	APW_ENG_20070621.0078.LDC2009T13	The site is one of the most visited U.S. military cemeteries in the world.
7789	APW_ENG_20070621.0078.LDC2009T13	It draws veterans' relatives, many of them Americans who feel proud of their country's contribution to the liberation of France and Europe, as well as veterans themselves whose numbers are dwindling -- but who still have many thoughts for their fallen comrades-in-arms.
7790	APW_ENG_20070621.0078.LDC2009T13	The center displays scratched and dented weapons, photos of soldiers who carried them, and excerpts from letters they sent home.
7791	APW_ENG_20070621.0078.LDC2009T13	It also shows documentary films and news reports about the war's progress.
7792	APW_ENG_20070621.0078.LDC2009T13	U.S. Congressmen David Obey, D-Wis., and John Murtha, D-Pa., proposed building the center in 2001, and it was designed by French-American architect Nicolas Kelemen.
7793	APW_ENG_20070621.0078.LDC2009T13	The first stone was laid two years ago.
7794	APW_ENG_20070621.0078.LDC2009T13	Some 200 American World War II veterans were on hand for the center's June 6, 2007, inauguration, along with 15 who had fought on the beaches, some of whom hadn't been back since the war, Aristegui said.

7805	APW_ENG_20070621.1381.LDC2009T13	WASHINGTON 2007-06-21 20:18:17 UTC
7806	APW_ENG_20070621.1381.LDC2009T13	The Iraq Study Group may be coming back.
7807	APW_ENG_20070621.1381.LDC2009T13	The House of Representatives adopted legislation Thursday to revive the bipartisan panel of prominent former U.S. officials who last year said President George W. Bush should change course on the war.
7808	APW_ENG_20070621.1381.LDC2009T13	A new assessment by the panel would offer lawmakers an independent alternative to an administration progress report due in September.
7809	APW_ENG_20070621.1381.LDC2009T13	And because the panel is unlikely to suggest U.S. combat troops remain in Iraq in large numbers, its recommendations could provide political cover for Republicans who want Bush to start bringing troops home.
7810	APW_ENG_20070621.1381.LDC2009T13	The measure was proposed by Rep. Chris Shays, who was hammered in the 2006 elections for his support for the war.
7811	APW_ENG_20070621.1381.LDC2009T13	Shays, a Republican and a political target for next year's elections as well, says Congress could benefit from an updated assessment by the Iraq Study Group.
7812	APW_ENG_20070621.1381.LDC2009T13	"We should remember we went into Iraq on a bipartisan basis," Shays wrote in a June 12 letter to Defense Secretary Robert Gates.
7813	APW_ENG_20070621.1381.LDC2009T13	Finding a bipartisan solution "will send a signal to our enemies and friends the United States stands together to confront this challenge."
7814	APW_ENG_20070621.1381.LDC2009T13	The House voted 355-69 to adopt the proposal as part of a $34.2 billion (euro25.5 illion) bill that funds State Department operations and foreign aid.
7815	APW_ENG_20070621.1381.LDC2009T13	Shays' proposal had already been adopted by voice vote, but the congressman said he insisted on a roll call to gauge support among his colleagues.
7816	APW_ENG_20070621.1381.LDC2009T13	The assessment would no doubt be juxtaposed to a progress report due in September from Gen. David Petraeus, the Iraq war commander, and U.S. Ambassador Ryan Crocker.
7817	APW_ENG_20070621.1381.LDC2009T13	Several Republicans say if progress is not made by then, they may call for a new strategy in Iraq.
7818	APW_ENG_20070621.1381.LDC2009T13	Lee Hamilton, the Democratic co-chairman of the Iraq Study Group, said in an interview Thursday that he is up for the job but did not want to pick apart the work of Petraeus or Crocker.
7819	APW_ENG_20070621.1381.LDC2009T13	"There was concern in some circles that we not monitor or pass judgment on Petraeus or his report in September.
7820	APW_ENG_20070621.1381.LDC2009T13	I agree generally with that" because it would make the work "highly political," Hamilton said.
7821	APW_ENG_20070621.1381.LDC2009T13	Accordingly, Shays gave the group only a general mandate to assess the war.
7822	APW_ENG_20070621.1381.LDC2009T13	It does not set a deadline.
7823	APW_ENG_20070621.1381.LDC2009T13	In December, the blue-ribbon study group, co-chaired by Republican James Baker, said U.S. troops' primary mission should evolve to supporting Iraqi security forces.
7824	APW_ENG_20070621.1381.LDC2009T13	The group also said the U.S. should reduce political, military or economic support for Iraq if the government in Baghdad cannot make substantial progress.
7825	APW_ENG_20070621.1381.LDC2009T13	Ultimately, the panel wrote, combat troops could be out by March 2008 if specific steps were taken.
7826	APW_ENG_20070621.1381.LDC2009T13	Baker was traveling Thursday and not available for comment, according to a spokesman.

7838	APW_ENG_20070625.0979.LDC2009T13	Roger Federer came onto Centre Court at Wimbledon dressed like a player from a bygone era.
7839	APW_ENG_20070625.0979.LDC2009T13	He then played like his usual modern- day great self.
7840	APW_ENG_20070625.0979.LDC2009T13	The top-ranked Swiss star began his bid for a record equaling fifth consecutive Wimbledon title Monday by beating Teimuraz Gabashvili of Russia 6-3, 6-2, 6-4 on a cool and wet opening day at the All England Club.
7841	APW_ENG_20070625.0979.LDC2009T13	It was Federer's 49th consecutive grass-court victory and 29th straight at Wimbledon, a streak dating back to 2003.
7842	APW_ENG_20070625.0979.LDC2009T13	With six more victories over the next two weeks, he would become the first player to win five straight championships since Bjorn Bjorg in 1976-80.
7843	APW_ENG_20070625.0979.LDC2009T13	"It was OK," Federer said.

7851	APW_ENG_20070625.0979.LDC2009T13	As is so often the case at Wimbledon, the tournament began in wet weather, with play getting under way after a rain delay of about 2 hours, 40 minutes.
7852	APW_ENG_20070625.0979.LDC2009T13	Play was suspended later in the afternoon because of more rain.
7853	APW_ENG_20070625.0979.LDC2009T13	In keeping with tradition, Federer was the first player to walk onto Centre Court as defending men's champion.
7854	APW_ENG_20070625.0979.LDC2009T13	He did it in style, wearing a white customized dinner-style jacket -- similar to the cream-colored model he donned last year -- with a gold crest and letters RF on the breast pocket and retro long white trousers.
7855	APW_ENG_20070625.0979.LDC2009T13	"Matching shoes, matching pants, matching vest and headband," Federer said.
7856	APW_ENG_20070625.0979.LDC2009T13	"It's a very nice outfit."
7857	APW_ENG_20070625.0979.LDC2009T13	Federer took off the jacket and warmed up with a white sweater vest and the long pants before getting straight down to business -- firing a service winner down the middle on the first point.
7858	APW_ENG_20070625.0979.LDC2009T13	He was never troubled by the 86th-ranked Gabashvili, who was making his Wimbledon debut and had won only one previous grass-court match.

7888	APW_ENG_20070626.1057.LDC2009T13	SOFIA, Bulgaria 2007-06-26 16:40:57 UTC
7889	APW_ENG_20070626.1057.LDC2009T13	Nigeria coach Berti Vogts denied reports he has offered to take over the Bulgarian national team, news reports said.
7890	APW_ENG_20070626.1057.LDC2009T13	Bulgaria's state-run news agency BTA reported earlier Tuesday that Vogts' manager Misha Stancovic said he had approached Bulgaria's soccer federation with an offer from Vogt to become the new coach of the team.
7891	APW_ENG_20070626.1057.LDC2009T13	However, Vogts told German news agency DPA that he was not aware of such an offer.
7892	APW_ENG_20070626.1057.LDC2009T13	"That's the first I hear ot it," DPA quoted Vogts as saying.
7893	APW_ENG_20070626.1057.LDC2009T13	BTA's report quoted Stancovic as saying he had "sent a fax to the Bulgarian Football Union with an offer from Berti Vogts to take over the Bulgarian national team, if union President Borislav Mihailov and the union leadership agree."
7894	APW_ENG_20070626.1057.LDC2009T13	The soccer federation would not say whether it had approached Vogts about the job, and did not immediately comment on the issue.
7895	APW_ENG_20070626.1057.LDC2009T13	It has previously said it wants to hire a foreigner as new coach, after Hristo Stoitchkov resigned from the post in April.

7901	APW_ENG_20070626.1332.LDC2009T13	WASHINGTON 2007-06-26 19:18:05 UTC
7902	APW_ENG_20070626.1332.LDC2009T13	Sen. George Voinovich said Tuesday the U.S. should begin pulling troops out of Iraq, joining Richard Lugar as the second Republican lawmaker in as many days to suggest President George W. Bush's war strategy is failing.
7903	APW_ENG_20070626.1332.LDC2009T13	He said the Iraqi people must become more involved and "I don't think they'll get it until they know we're leaving."
7904	APW_ENG_20070626.1332.LDC2009T13	The Ohio senator's remarks followed similar comments by Lugar, the top Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, the previous night.
7905	APW_ENG_20070626.1332.LDC2009T13	The two Republican senators previously had expressed concerns about Bush's decision to send 30,000 extra troops to Iraq in a massive U.S.-led security push in Baghdad and Anbar province.
7906	APW_ENG_20070626.1332.LDC2009T13	But they had stopped short of saying U.S. troops should leave and declined to back Democratic legislation setting a deadline for troop withdrawals.
7907	APW_ENG_20070626.1332.LDC2009T13	"We must not abandon our mission, but we must begin a transition where the Iraqi government and its neighbors play a larger role in stabilizing Iraq," Voinovich wrote in a letter to Bush.
7908	APW_ENG_20070626.1332.LDC2009T13	Lugar and Voinovich said they were still not ready to insist on a timetable for withdrawal.
7909	APW_ENG_20070626.1332.LDC2009T13	But they both made it clear their patience was gone.
7910	APW_ENG_20070626.1332.LDC2009T13	Once Iraq's neighbors "know we are genuinely leaving, I think all of a sudden the fear of God will descend upon them and say, 'We've got to get involved in this thing,'" Voinovich told reporters.
7911	APW_ENG_20070626.1332.LDC2009T13	"It can't be something that is precipitous, but I do believe that it should be enough so that people know we are indeed disengaging," he added.
7912	APW_ENG_20070626.1332.LDC2009T13	The loss of Republican support for the president's strategy is significant.
7913	APW_ENG_20070626.1332.LDC2009T13	Democrats may still not be able to push through legislation demanding an end date to the war, but softer alternative proposals are in the works that could still challenge Bush.
7914	APW_ENG_20070626.1332.LDC2009T13	After a holiday recess early next month, "you'll be hearing a number of statements from other (Republican) colleagues," predicted Sen. John Warner, a longtime skeptic of the war strategy.
7915	APW_ENG_20070626.1332.LDC2009T13	Spokesman John Ullyot said Warner is drafting a legislative proposal on the war, but declined to discuss the details.
7916	APW_ENG_20070626.1332.LDC2009T13	The measure would likely be offered as an amendment to the 2008 defense authorization bill on the floor next month.
7917	APW_ENG_20070626.1332.LDC2009T13	The White House on Tuesday appealed to members for more patience on the war in Iraq.
7918	APW_ENG_20070626.1332.LDC2009T13	"We hope that members of the House and Senate will give the Baghdad security plan a chance to unfold," said White House spokesman Tony Snow.
7919	APW_ENG_20070626.1332.LDC2009T13	Snow also said Lugar was a thoughtful man and that his remarks came as no surprise.
7920	APW_ENG_20070626.1332.LDC2009T13	"We've known that he's had reservations about the policy for some time," he said.
7921	APW_ENG_20070626.1332.LDC2009T13	In January, Lugar expressed concerns about the president's decision to send 30,000 extra troops to Baghdad.
7922	APW_ENG_20070626.1332.LDC2009T13	But he voted against a resolution opposing Bush's troop build up, contending that the nonbinding measure would have no practical effect.
7923	APW_ENG_20070626.1332.LDC2009T13	In the spring, he voted against a Democratic bill that would have triggered troop withdrawals by Oct. 1 with the goal of completing the pullout in six months.
7924	APW_ENG_20070626.1332.LDC2009T13	In a floor speech Monday, Lugar said the U.S. should reduce the military's role in Iraq and called on Bush to press other diplomatic and economic initiatives instead.
7925	APW_ENG_20070626.1332.LDC2009T13	Because of Lugar's position as the top Republican on the Foreign Relations Committee, his speech was a considered a blow to the administration as it tries to shore up sagging political support for the unpopular war.
7926	APW_ENG_20070626.1332.LDC2009T13	"In my judgment, the costs and risks of continuing down the current path outweigh the potential benefits that might be achieved," Lugar, R-Ind., said in a Senate floor speech.
7927	APW_ENG_20070626.1332.LDC2009T13	"Persisting indefinitely with the surge strategy will delay policy adjustments that have a better chance of protecting our vital interests over the long term."

7942	APW_ENG_20070701.0319.LDC2009T13	Jordan's King Abdullah II flatly rejected a confederation with the Palestinians on Sunday, calling any such proposal at the current time a "conspiracy" against his kingdom and the Palestinians, a local newspaper reported.
7943	APW_ENG_20070701.0319.LDC2009T13	Despite government assertions to the contrary, speculation has mounted in recent weeks that Jordan may want to assume a protectorate role in the West Bank by forming a confederation with the Palestinians.
7944	APW_ENG_20070701.0319.LDC2009T13	In newspaper remarks published Sunday, Abdullah said he was "fed up talking about this issue."
7945	APW_ENG_20070701.0319.LDC2009T13	"We reject the formula of confederation and federation and we believe that proposing this issue at this specific period is a conspiracy against both Palestine and Jordan," Abdullah told the independent Al-Ghad newspaper.

7951	APW_ENG_20070701.0319.LDC2009T13	But Abdullah echoed his father's position Sunday, saying it was "premature to talk about the shape of future relations with Palestine and we will not tackle this issue until an independent Palestinian state on Palestinian soil is established."
7952	APW_ENG_20070701.0319.LDC2009T13	When asked if there was Israeli or U.S. pressure on Jordan to accept a confederation with the Palestinians, he said, "We will not accept such solutions no matter what the pressures are."
7953	APW_ENG_20070701.0319.LDC2009T13	The king harshly rebuked Israel in the interview, underlining his frustration with its peace policies.
7954	APW_ENG_20070701.0319.LDC2009T13	Despite cordial relations with his neighbor under a 1994 peace treaty, Abdullah described Israel as a "solid enemy" of the Palestinians, saying the Jewish state "will not achieve the security it desires, unless Palestinian political rights are addressed."

7962	APW_ENG_20070703.1244.LDC2009T13	Street battles between Islamic radicals and security forces at a fortress-like mosque in the Pakistani capital left at least nine people dead Tuesday, adding to the country's sense of crisis.
7963	APW_ENG_20070703.1244.LDC2009T13	Militant supporters of the mosque later pelted two government buildings, including the Ministry of Environment, with rocks and set them ablaze, and torched a dozen cars in the ministry's lot.
7964	APW_ENG_20070703.1244.LDC2009T13	The violence dramatically deepened a six-month standoff at Islamabad's Lal Masjid, or Red Mosque, whose hardline clerics have challenged the government by kidnapping alleged prostitutes and police in a Taliban-style anti-vice campaign.
7965	APW_ENG_20070703.1244.LDC2009T13	At nightfall, the city's top security official, Khalid Pervez, said a ceasefire had been reached with the armed militants.
7966	APW_ENG_20070703.1244.LDC2009T13	Deputy Interior Minister Zafar Warriach said the dead included four students, three civilians, one soldier and a journalist.
7967	APW_ENG_20070703.1244.LDC2009T13	However, clerics at the mosque claimed that 10 of their supporters died, according to a lawmaker sent to mediate.
7968	APW_ENG_20070703.1244.LDC2009T13	Warriach said 148 were injured, most of them by tear gas fired by security forces.

7971	APW_ENG_20070703.1244.LDC2009T13	Officials said the trouble started on Tuesday morning when police moved to stop militant students from occupying a government building.
7972	APW_ENG_20070703.1244.LDC2009T13	Reporters saw dozens of students, including young men with guns and women in black burqas, moving toward security forces deployed about 200 meters (yards) from the red-walled, white domed mosque.
7973	APW_ENG_20070703.1244.LDC2009T13	Police shot tear gas and several male students, some of them masked, opened fire toward the security forces.
7974	APW_ENG_20070703.1244.LDC2009T13	Gunfire was also heard from the police position.
7975	APW_ENG_20070703.1244.LDC2009T13	Security forces, some riding in armored vehicles, cordoned off the area with barbed wire and checkpoints, and sporadic gunfire continued for several hours.

7977	APW_ENG_20070703.1244.LDC2009T13	At one point, a man used the mosque's loudspeakers to order suicide bombers to get into position.

7982	APW_ENG_20070703.1244.LDC2009T13	When asked about the presence of armed students at his mosque, Ghazi said they "are our guards."
7983	APW_ENG_20070703.1244.LDC2009T13	Shah Abdul Aziz, a lawmaker for a hard-line religious party who rushed to the mosque to mediate said the mosque's leaders claimed that 10 of their supporters had died, including two female students.

7986	APW_ENG_20070703.1244.LDC2009T13	Police and witnesses said more than 2,000 students from an Islamic school in the eastern city of Lahore rallied Tuesday, chanting slogans against Pakistani President Gen. Pervez Musharraf.
7987	APW_ENG_20070703.1244.LDC2009T13	Addressing the protesters, Mufti Hamidullah Jan, a cleric at the Jamia Ashrafia madrassa, vowed to send his students to Islamabad if the government did not stop its action at the Red Mosque.
7988	APW_ENG_20070703.1244.LDC2009T13	"Now is not the time for protests, but jihad (holy war)," he said.
7989	APW_ENG_20070703.1244.LDC2009T13	The students shouted "yes" when Jan asked them if they were ready for holy war.
7990	APW_ENG_20070703.1244.LDC2009T13	Also Tuesday, about 200 supporters of a radical religious party in the southwestern city of Quetta burned tires to protest the police action against the Islamabad mosque and chanted slogans against Musharraf and U.S. President George W. Bush.
7991	APW_ENG_20070703.1244.LDC2009T13	"Anyone who is a friend of America, is a traitor," many of the protesters chanted.
7992	APW_ENG_20070703.1244.LDC2009T13	Authorities have been at loggerheads with the mosque for months over a land dispute and after its followers began a campaign to impose a harsh version of Islamic law in the capital.
7993	APW_ENG_20070703.1244.LDC2009T13	Senior officials, including the head of the ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Q party, have tried to negotiate a settlement of their grievances.
7994	APW_ENG_20070703.1244.LDC2009T13	However, the clerics have steadily raised the stakes, staging kidnappings of police officers and alleged prostitutes, including several Chinese nationals, and repeatedly threatening suicide attacks if security forces intervene.
7995	APW_ENG_20070703.1244.LDC2009T13	Some accuse intelligence agencies of encouraging the crisis to justify a state of emergency and prolong military rule -- a conspiracy theory with considerable traction in Pakistan's intrigue-ridden politics.
7996	APW_ENG_20070703.1244.LDC2009T13	Plans for the general, a close U.S. ally who seized power in a 1999 coup, to ask lawmakers for a new five-year term this fall are in doubt because of a political row over his attempt to fire the country's top judge.
7997	APW_ENG_20070703.1244.LDC2009T13	However, Musharraf's failure to crack down on the clerics' spreading fear in the capital has dented his credentials as a bulwark against extremism -- diminishing his worth to Washington, his key international backer.
7998	APW_ENG_20070703.1244.LDC2009T13	Musharraf said last week that he was ready to raid the mosque, but warned that militants linked to al-Qaida had slipped inside and that the media would blame any bloodbath on the government.

8003	APW_ENG_20070705.0209.LDC2009T13	Johnny Frigo, a versatile jazz violinist and bassist who toured with Jimmy Dorsey and wrote a jazz standard recorded by Billie Holiday and Sarah Vaughn, has died, according to his son.
8004	APW_ENG_20070705.0209.LDC2009T13	He was 90.
8005	APW_ENG_20070705.0209.LDC2009T13	Frigo died early Wednesday at a Chicago hospital after battling cancer in recent years, said his son Rick Frigo.
8006	APW_ENG_20070705.0209.LDC2009T13	Johnny Frigo was born on Chicago's South Side and spent much of his career playing bass.
8007	APW_ENG_20070705.0209.LDC2009T13	After playing with the U.S. Coast Guard band at Ellis Island during World War II, he toured with clarinetist Jimmy Dorsey and his orchestra.
8008	APW_ENG_20070705.0209.LDC2009T13	Around that time, Frigo wrote "Detour Ahead," a song that became a jazz standard recorded by Holiday and Vaughn, among others.
8009	APW_ENG_20070705.0209.LDC2009T13	He was in his late 60s or early 70s when he turned his attention to the violin, appearing twice on "The Tonight Show" with Johnny Carson.
8010	APW_ENG_20070705.0209.LDC2009T13	"Nobody played violin like him," said his son.
8011	APW_ENG_20070705.0209.LDC2009T13	"Chicago's a poorer place without him."
8012	APW_ENG_20070705.0209.LDC2009T13	Frigo was also a poet and artist with a keen sense of humor, his son said.
8013	APW_ENG_20070705.0209.LDC2009T13	When Carson asked him why he'd waited so long to launch his jazz violin career, he replied that he did not want there to be enough time for him to become a has-been, his son said.

8019	APW_ENG_20070705.1256.LDC2009T13	A six-year-old girl has been hospitalized after a horrifying accident at a swimming pool, when she sat on an open drain and a powerful suction pump tore out part of her intestinal tract.
8020	APW_ENG_20070705.1256.LDC2009T13	Abigail Taylor was injured in the wading pool on June 29, according to her family.
8021	APW_ENG_20070705.1256.LDC2009T13	Her father, Scott Taylor, told WCCO-TV that the suction caused a 2-inch (5-centimeter) tear in Abigail's rectum and pulled out much of her small intestine.
8022	APW_ENG_20070705.1256.LDC2009T13	Doctors had to remove the part of her intestines that remained, according to the family's lawyer, Bob Bennett.
8023	APW_ENG_20070705.1256.LDC2009T13	Abigail remained in intensive care at Children's Hospital on Thursday and appears to be doing better, Bennett said.
8024	APW_ENG_20070705.1256.LDC2009T13	She was to undergo surgery on Friday, Bennett said.
8025	APW_ENG_20070705.1256.LDC2009T13	"She'll receive her nutrition through a port for the rest of her life," he said.
8026	APW_ENG_20070705.1256.LDC2009T13	Bennett said that the swimming pool's drain hole was improperly uncovered.
8027	APW_ENG_20070705.1256.LDC2009T13	However, the general manager of the club where the pool is located told the St. Paul Pioneer Press he did not think anything was wrong with the pool.

8034	APW_ENG_20070707.0102.LDC2009T13	A property owned by Atlanta Falcons quarterback Michael Vick was used as the "main staging area for housing and training the pit bulls involved" in an illegal dog-fighting operation, according to court documents.
8035	APW_ENG_20070707.0102.LDC2009T13	The papers, filed by federal authorities Monday in U.S. District Court in Richmond and obtained Friday by The Associated Press, contain the address of the Vick property that has been the center of the investigation.
8036	APW_ENG_20070707.0102.LDC2009T13	The three-time National Football League Pro Bowl quarterback is not identified in the documents, which were filed in attempt to condemn the property and force its forfeiture.
8037	APW_ENG_20070707.0102.LDC2009T13	Friday, federal agents again searched the property.
8038	APW_ENG_20070707.0102.LDC2009T13	They finished their work at about 4:30 p.m. and declined to answer reporters' questions as they left.
8039	APW_ENG_20070707.0102.LDC2009T13	Staging or facilitating dog fighting is a felony in 48 of 50 states in the United States, including Virginia.
8040	APW_ENG_20070707.0102.LDC2009T13	According to the documents, dog fights have been sponsored by "Bad Newz Kennels" at the property since at least 2002.
8041	APW_ENG_20070707.0102.LDC2009T13	For the events, participants and dogs traveled from South Carolina, North Carolina, Maryland, New York, Texas and other states.
8042	APW_ENG_20070707.0102.LDC2009T13	Fifty-four animals were recovered from the property during searches in April, along with a "rape stand," used to hold dogs in place for mating

8045	APW_ENG_20070707.0102.LDC2009T13	Fights would end when one dog died or with the surrender of the losing dog, which was sometimes put to death by drowning, strangulation, hanging, gun shot, electrocution or some other method, according to the documents.
8046	APW_ENG_20070707.0102.LDC2009T13	Vick has said he rarely visited the property.
8047	APW_ENG_20070707.0102.LDC2009T13	No criminal charges have been filed.
8048	APW_ENG_20070707.0102.LDC2009T13	Officials raided the property on April 25, and -- after an informant suggested authorities could find as many as 30 dogs buried on the property -- Surry County officials secured a search warrant but never acted on it because prosecutor Gerald G. Poindexter said he had concerns with the document.
8049	APW_ENG_20070707.0102.LDC2009T13	On June 7, the day that warrant expired, federal officials executed their own with the help of state police investigators.
8050	APW_ENG_20070707.0102.LDC2009T13	Poindexter publicly questioned the federal government's interest in the case.
8051	APW_ENG_20070707.0102.LDC2009T13	He suggested Vick's celebrity was the draw and raised race as a possible motivation.
8052	APW_ENG_20070707.0102.LDC2009T13	Poindexter and Vick are black, as is Sheriff Harold Brown.
8053	APW_ENG_20070707.0102.LDC2009T13	Vick has said he had no idea the property may have been used in a criminal enterprise and blamed family members for taking advantage of his generosity.

8056	APW_ENG_20070707.0463.LDC2009T13	BEIRUT, Lebanon 2007-07-07 14:06:06 UTC
8057	APW_ENG_20070707.0463.LDC2009T13	The investigation into last year's assassination of a Christian Cabinet minister points to the involvement of al-Qaida-inspired Islamic militants, a Lebanese security official familiar with the case said Saturday.
8058	APW_ENG_20070707.0463.LDC2009T13	Lebanon's An-Nahar newspaper also reported that police investigating the killing of former Industry Minister Pierre Gemayel turned up evidence that the Fatah Islam group battling the Lebanese army in northern Lebanon was behind the assassination.
8059	APW_ENG_20070707.0463.LDC2009T13	Gemayel was shot dead by gunmen at an intersection north of Beirut on November 21 last year.
8060	APW_ENG_20070707.0463.LDC2009T13	His death was part of a string of other assassinations that are being investigated by a U.N. commission initially established to investigate the February 2005 assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri.
8061	APW_ENG_20070707.0463.LDC2009T13	Lebanon's ruling anti-Syrian coalition, including Gemayel's father, former President Amin Gemayel, have implied Syria was behind the assassinations -- a charge Syria denies.
8062	APW_ENG_20070707.0463.LDC2009T13	Lebanese government officials also accuse Syria of backing Fatah Islam to stir up trouble in Lebanon, which Damascus long controlled before being forced to leave in 2005 because of international pressure in the wake of Hariri's death.
8063	APW_ENG_20070707.0463.LDC2009T13	Damascus denies the claim, saying it considers Fatah Islam a dangerous terrorist organization.
8064	APW_ENG_20070707.0463.LDC2009T13	The security official, speaking on customary condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to give official statements, confirmed An-Nahar's report and said that "important progress" had been made with regards to the investigation into Pierre Gemayel's killing.
8065	APW_ENG_20070707.0463.LDC2009T13	The official said interrogations of Fatah Islam detainees show that the al-Qaida-inspired group is involved in the assassination.
8066	APW_ENG_20070707.0463.LDC2009T13	He refused to elaborate, saying details would soon be made public and had already been relayed to the U.N. investigating team.
8067	APW_ENG_20070707.0463.LDC2009T13	A Lebanese cabinet minister, Ahmed Fatfat, said the involvement of Fatah Islam in Gemayel's assassination is now "much clearer" than before, but the investigations were continuing.
8068	APW_ENG_20070707.0463.LDC2009T13	Asked by the pan-Arab satellite TV station Al-Arabiya if there were other suspects, he replied: "Unfortunately it looks like it is confined to Fatah Islam, and, behind it unfortunately, are hands linked to Syrian intelligence agencies."
8069	APW_ENG_20070707.0463.LDC2009T13	The exact number of Fatah Islam militants arrested since the group clashed with the army has not been disclosed.
8070	APW_ENG_20070707.0463.LDC2009T13	But the defense minister said last month that about 40 militants, including some suspected of links with al-Qaida, had been arrested.
8071	APW_ENG_20070707.0463.LDC2009T13	Fatah Islam has been fighting Lebanese army troops at the Nahr el-Bared Palestinian refugee camp since May 20.
8072	APW_ENG_20070707.0463.LDC2009T13	Authorities also accuse it of carrying out the Feb. 13 bombings of two commuter buses in the Christian heartland north of Beirut that killed three people.
8073	APW_ENG_20070707.0463.LDC2009T13	The group has denied being involved in these bombings.
8074	APW_ENG_20070707.0463.LDC2009T13	More than 160 people, including 84 soldiers, have been killed in the Nahr el-Bared fighting, the worst internal violence since Lebanon's 1975-90 civil war.
8075	APW_ENG_20070707.0463.LDC2009T13	The army on Saturday renewed its call for the militants inside Nahr el-Bared to surrender to "avoid more bloodshed and limit moral and material losses," according to a statement.

8079	APW_ENG_20070709.0936.LDC2009T13	Four men were convicted Monday of plotting to bomb London's public transport system on July 21, 2005 -- an attack with deliberate echoes of suicide bombings that killed 52 commuters on the network two weeks earlier.
8080	APW_ENG_20070709.0936.LDC2009T13	Inspired by al-Qaida, the four attempted to detonate explosives- laden backpacks on three subway trains and a bus, as in the July 7, 2005, attacks.
8081	APW_ENG_20070709.0936.LDC2009T13	The devices -- made from a volatile mix of hydrogen peroxide and flour -- failed to explode, and no one was injured.
8082	APW_ENG_20070709.0936.LDC2009T13	A jury unanimously found Muktar Said Ibrahim, 29
8083	APW_ENG_20070709.0936.LDC2009T13	Yassin Omar, 26
8084	APW_ENG_20070709.0936.LDC2009T13	and Ramzi Mohammed, 25, guilty of conspiracy to murder.
8085	APW_ENG_20070709.0936.LDC2009T13	Several hours later they returned another guilty verdict on Hussain Osman, 28.
8086	APW_ENG_20070709.0936.LDC2009T13	Unlike the July 7 bombers, who were British-born, those in the July 21 plot had come to Britain as young men from places like Eritrea, Ethiopia and Somalia in the war-wracked Horn of Africa.
8087	APW_ENG_20070709.0936.LDC2009T13	There was no indication any were in the country illegally -- some had become British citizens, others had refugee status.
8088	APW_ENG_20070709.0936.LDC2009T13	The verdicts, at the end of a six-month trial, came days after police uncovered a plot to detonate car bombs in London's entertainment district and two men rammed a flaming Jeep Cherokee into Glasgow International Airport.
8089	APW_ENG_20070709.0936.LDC2009T13	The jury was still deliberating on two alleged accomplices.
8090	APW_ENG_20070709.0936.LDC2009T13	Judge Adrian Fulford told the jury of nine women and three men he would accept 10-2 majority verdicts on the other two defendants, Manfo Kwaku Asiedu, 34
8091	APW_ENG_20070709.0936.LDC2009T13	and Adel Yahya, 24.
8092	APW_ENG_20070709.0936.LDC2009T13	All six suspects denied the charges, saying the devices were duds and their actions a protest against the Iraq war.
8093	APW_ENG_20070709.0936.LDC2009T13	But police and prosecutors said scientific tests proved the bombs were all viable.
8094	APW_ENG_20070709.0936.LDC2009T13	They do not know why they did not work.
8095	APW_ENG_20070709.0936.LDC2009T13	The gang convicted Monday had bought 442 liters (117 gallons) of hydrogen peroxide -- an easily available chemical commonly used for bleaching and coloring hair.
8096	APW_ENG_20070709.0936.LDC2009T13	At a makeshift "bomb factory" in Omar's north London apartment, they boiled the chemical to a concentration of 70 percent to increase its explosive potential.
8097	APW_ENG_20070709.0936.LDC2009T13	The bombs' main explosive charge was 70 percent liquid hydrogen peroxide and 30 percent flour of the sort used to make chapatis, a type of Indian flat bread.
8098	APW_ENG_20070709.0936.LDC2009T13	The explosives were packed in plastic tubs, with screws, bolts and other pieces of metal taped to the outside as shrapnel.
8099	APW_ENG_20070709.0936.LDC2009T13	The detonators contained triacetone triperoxide (TATP), an explosive used by the July 7 bombers.
8100	APW_ENG_20070709.0936.LDC2009T13	Omar, Mohammed and Osman tried to set off their devices aboard three subway trains
8101	APW_ENG_20070709.0936.LDC2009T13	a couple of hours later, Ibrahim's bomb failed aboard a double-decker bus.
8102	APW_ENG_20070709.0936.LDC2009T13	Prosecutors say Asiedu lost his nerve and abandoned his device in a London park.
8103	APW_ENG_20070709.0936.LDC2009T13	Yahya left Britain for Ethiopia several weeks before the attacks.
8104	APW_ENG_20070709.0936.LDC2009T13	During the trial, Asiedu turned on the others and claimed Ibrahim, the gang's self-proclaimed leader, had wanted the attacks "to be bigger and better" than the July 7 bombs.
8105	APW_ENG_20070709.0936.LDC2009T13	The botched plot rattled a city already shaken by the July 7 attacks, as detectives launched the biggest manhunt in British history.
8106	APW_ENG_20070709.0936.LDC2009T13	A day after the failed attacks, police shot dead Jean Charles de Menezes, a Brazilian electrician they mistook for one of the bombers.
8107	APW_ENG_20070709.0936.LDC2009T13	Police said they were under enormous pressure to capture the men, uncertain over whether they would try again and anxious to avoid a repeat of the aftermath of the hunt for terrorists responsible for the 2004 Madrid train bombings.
8108	APW_ENG_20070709.0936.LDC2009T13	Then, suspects killed a police officer and themselves when they exploded booby traps as police stormed their hideout.
8109	APW_ENG_20070709.0936.LDC2009T13	Most of the suspects were arrested in England a few days after the attacks.
8110	APW_ENG_20070709.0936.LDC2009T13	Osman fled to Italy and was detained in Rome a week later.

8112	APW_ENG_20070709.0936.LDC2009T13	"In all honesty, I still don't know to this day how I did not shoot him," said the officer, describing how his submachine gun was trained on Omar's head.
8113	APW_ENG_20070709.0936.LDC2009T13	Much of the prosecution's case was based on eyewitness testimony and closed circuit television footage from the targeted subway cars and bus.

8121	APW_ENG_20070709.1240.LDC2009T13	Judge allows testimony that Phil Spector threatened to shoot women
8122	APW_ENG_20070709.1240.LDC2009T13	LOS ANGELES 2007-07-09 21:49:46 UTC
8123	APW_ENG_20070709.1240.LDC2009T13	The judge in music producer Phil Spector's murder trial reversed an earlier ruling Monday and decided to allow jurors to hear damaging testimony from a celebrity security guard who says he heard Spector rant profanely against women and declare they should all be shot in the head.
8124	APW_ENG_20070709.1240.LDC2009T13	The ruling came after Vincent Tannazzo, a retired New York City police detective, testified without the jury present that at two Manhattan Christmas parties given a year apart in the early 1990s, Spector was ejected, yelling obscenities against women and shouting, "These (expletive for women).
8125	APW_ENG_20070709.1240.LDC2009T13	They all deserve a bullet in their heads."
8126	APW_ENG_20070709.1240.LDC2009T13	While he originally thought it was inadmissible because it was too long ago and did not address the specific details of the Feb. 3, 2003, gunshot death of actress Lana Clarkson, Superior Court Judge Larry Paul Fidler said he researched the law further and changed his mind.
8127	APW_ENG_20070709.1240.LDC2009T13	Although the comments by Spector may have occurred as long ago as 1993, they were relevant to show Spector's state of mind toward women, the judge said.
8128	APW_ENG_20070709.1240.LDC2009T13	"In this case you have a woman who is shot in the head," Fidler said, referring to Clarkson's death from a bullet fired through her mouth.
8129	APW_ENG_20070709.1240.LDC2009T13	"It is highly particularized."
8130	APW_ENG_20070709.1240.LDC2009T13	The defense contends Clarkson shot herself.
8131	APW_ENG_20070709.1240.LDC2009T13	The judge also said the testimony "tends to show the depth of Mr. Spector's anger."
8132	APW_ENG_20070709.1240.LDC2009T13	Defense attorney Roger Rosen denounced the testimony as "character assassination" and said it should be excluded.
8133	APW_ENG_20070709.1240.LDC2009T13	In both instances, a year apart, Tannazzo said he ejected a ranting Spector from the parties hosted by comedian Joan Rivers.
8134	APW_ENG_20070709.1240.LDC2009T13	On the first occasion in 1993 or 1994, Dorothy Melvin, Rivers' manager, called him at his post outside the party, Tannazzo said.
8135	APW_ENG_20070709.1240.LDC2009T13	"She said, 'Vinnie, get up here.
8136	APW_ENG_20070709.1240.LDC2009T13	Phil Spector just pulled out a gun,'" Tannazzo testified.
8137	APW_ENG_20070709.1240.LDC2009T13	He could tell Spector had a handgun in his waistband, and the producer made the comment about women deserving to be shot in the head.
8138	APW_ENG_20070709.1240.LDC2009T13	At the second party, Tannazzo said he was again called to escort Spector outside.
8139	APW_ENG_20070709.1240.LDC2009T13	This time, he said, another woman walked out while Spector was leaving and "Phil Spector looked at her and said, 'That (expletive).
8140	APW_ENG_20070709.1240.LDC2009T13	I ought to put a bullet in her head right now.'"
8141	APW_ENG_20070709.1240.LDC2009T13	The Tannazzo issue came up as the trial resumed after a one-week recess for the Independence Day holiday.
8142	APW_ENG_20070709.1240.LDC2009T13	The defense has already begun its side of the case, but the judge's ruling allowed the prosecution to reopen its case to call him to the stand.
8143	APW_ENG_20070709.1240.LDC2009T13	Spector, 67, rose to fame in the 1960s with a recording technique known as the "Wall of Sound."
8144	APW_ENG_20070709.1240.LDC2009T13	Clarkson, 40, was a struggling actress best known for her role in the 1985 film "Barbarian Queen."
8145	APW_ENG_20070709.1240.LDC2009T13	She was working as a nightclub hostess when she met Spector and agreed to go to his suburban mansion when she got off work in the early morning of Feb. 3, 2003.

8150	APW_ENG_20070710.0317.LDC2009T13	Two years later, the Iraqi woman is mourning the death of her husband.
8151	APW_ENG_20070710.0317.LDC2009T13	Ahearn, 43, was killed Thursday in Baghdad when his vehicle struck a roadside bomb.
8152	APW_ENG_20070710.0317.LDC2009T13	And Lena Ahearn said she is left feeling ashamed that her husband died in her country at the hands of her people.
8153	APW_ENG_20070710.0317.LDC2009T13	Ahearn, a member of the 96th Civil Affairs Battalion, 95th Civil Affairs Brigade at Fort Bragg, was on his third tour of Iraq when he was killed.
8154	APW_ENG_20070710.0317.LDC2009T13	He had served in the Army for 18 years and was supposed to retire in 2009.
8155	APW_ENG_20070710.0317.LDC2009T13	"Jimmy was the greatest gift I ever had," Lena said from the couple's home near the Army post where she lives with their 17 -month-old daughter, Kadi.
8156	APW_ENG_20070710.0317.LDC2009T13	"I will never regret marrying him for two years and moving to the United States."
8157	APW_ENG_20070710.0317.LDC2009T13	Lena Ahearn said her husband tried to use his new belief in Islam to bridge the cultural gap between American soldiers and the Iraqi people.
8158	APW_ENG_20070710.0317.LDC2009T13	"He told them there are no differences between people," she said.
8159	APW_ENG_20070710.0317.LDC2009T13	Now Lena Ahearn says she wants to become an American citizen, which she thinks would have made her husband proud.
8160	APW_ENG_20070710.0317.LDC2009T13	And she will hold onto the memories of that good-looking American soldier who used his own money to buy toys for Iraqi children.

8163	APW_ENG_20070711.1331.LDC2009T13	LAGOS, Nigeria 2007-07-11 17:33:16 UTC
8164	APW_ENG_20070711.1331.LDC2009T13	In Nigeria's oil-rich south, foreign workers are known as "white gold" among the gangs who kidnap them for ransom.
8165	APW_ENG_20070711.1331.LDC2009T13	"Ah, the whites are coming," chuckled one young gang member -- sipping beer in a ramshackle, roadside bar -- as a heavily guarded oil company convoy sped through traffic-choked Port Harcourt, sirens blaring.
8166	APW_ENG_20070711.1331.LDC2009T13	"It's like the vans for ice creams in your country."
8167	APW_ENG_20070711.1331.LDC2009T13	Nigeria is Africa's largest producer of crude oil, known as "black gold."
8168	APW_ENG_20070711.1331.LDC2009T13	But the country is in the grip of a kidnapping epidemic, with more than 150 foreigners seized so far this year, including a woman and a child -- nearly the total for all of last year.
8169	APW_ENG_20070711.1331.LDC2009T13	The attacks have contributed to a drop in production of about 25 percent, driving up oil prices worldwide with no end to the string of kidnappings in sight.
8170	APW_ENG_20070711.1331.LDC2009T13	Ransoms are fueling the surge, gang members and oil industry officials say.
8171	APW_ENG_20070711.1331.LDC2009T13	They also claim a cut goes to the government officials who shuttle between the charm-bedecked, rifle-toting gunmen in the swamps and professional negotiators flown in from Paris or London.
8172	APW_ENG_20070711.1331.LDC2009T13	"Absolutely not true," Rivers state spokesman Emmanuel Okah said earlier this week.
8173	APW_ENG_20070711.1331.LDC2009T13	But a militant from the Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta, a group behind a number of high-profile kidnappings said all sides pocket a portion of the ransom.
8174	APW_ENG_20070711.1331.LDC2009T13	"Practically everyone involved in hostage negotiations has had his hands soiled," the militant said by e-mail on condition of anonymity.
8175	APW_ENG_20070711.1331.LDC2009T13	"Officials merely up the demands of the abductors and keep the rest to themselves, most times unknown to the abductors."
8176	APW_ENG_20070711.1331.LDC2009T13	One oil worker recounted how his captors and visiting officials argued over his ransom.
8177	APW_ENG_20070711.1331.LDC2009T13	The kidnappers insisted they had asked for more than twice the offered amount
8178	APW_ENG_20070711.1331.LDC2009T13	officials said it had been stolen when they left the cash unattended.
8179	APW_ENG_20070711.1331.LDC2009T13	He said he remained in captivity while they were sent back for more.
8180	APW_ENG_20070711.1331.LDC2009T13	In another case, Nigerian security forces threatened to kill a hostage if he revealed the discrepancy between what his company paid and what his kidnappers received, a security expert said.
8181	APW_ENG_20070711.1331.LDC2009T13	"In many cases, the proportion of released funds that ends up in the hands of the kidnappers is unknown," another security professional said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
8182	APW_ENG_20070711.1331.LDC2009T13	"State or local government officials are keen to act as the intermediaries in kidnap negotiations."
8183	APW_ENG_20070711.1331.LDC2009T13	It's a delicate subject.
8184	APW_ENG_20070711.1331.LDC2009T13	Company officials refuse to discuss ransoms for fear of alienating powerful local interests or becoming targets themselves.
8185	APW_ENG_20070711.1331.LDC2009T13	Former hostages fear retribution from ex-captors or losing their job if they talk to the media.
8186	APW_ENG_20070711.1331.LDC2009T13	Even gang members fear speaking out, even though they often serve as hired muscle during elections and frequently engage in violent clashes between themselves.
8187	APW_ENG_20070711.1331.LDC2009T13	The ex-hostage, security professionals and the gang member asked that no further details be published to protect their identity, and most of those who talked to The Associated Press about government collusion in kidnappings asked for anonymity for similar reasons.
8188	APW_ENG_20070711.1331.LDC2009T13	Few companies have a direct line to the kidnappers.
8189	APW_ENG_20070711.1331.LDC2009T13	When four Agip employees were kidnapped late last year, the militant group holding them said the company spent a total of US$1.5 million trying to secure their release through various middlemen, a charge denied by Agip's parent company, Eni SpA.
8190	APW_ENG_20070711.1331.LDC2009T13	"The company has never paid any ransom for the release of its employees kidnapped in Nigeria," a spokeswoman said from Rome, speaking on condition of anonymity on accordance with company policy.
8191	APW_ENG_20070711.1331.LDC2009T13	No oil company has ever publicly admitted paying for hostages, but militants insist it happens.
8192	APW_ENG_20070711.1331.LDC2009T13	"Agip has so far lost more than 200 million naira (US$1.5 million) to various con artists," the militant group said in an e-mail before announcing that the ransom -- allegedly unsolicited -- had been "confiscated."
8193	APW_ENG_20070711.1331.LDC2009T13	The militants, who claim to kidnap as part of a campaign for political concessions and a greater share of oil revenues for the poverty-stricken region, appeared to be trying to distinguish themselves from criminal gangs that kidnap for money.
8194	APW_ENG_20070711.1331.LDC2009T13	Yet the web of connections among the militants, the criminals and the government is more tangled than the roots of the steamy mangrove swamps where the hostages are held.
8195	APW_ENG_20070711.1331.LDC2009T13	The militant group balked when pressed for more details on government involvement.
8196	APW_ENG_20070711.1331.LDC2009T13	"I never wish to seem like a snitch," said a spokesman, who denied soliciting ransoms.
8197	APW_ENG_20070711.1331.LDC2009T13	But one state official admitted to the AP that he took cash during the Agip kidnapping.
8198	APW_ENG_20070711.1331.LDC2009T13	He spoke on condition of anonymity.
8199	APW_ENG_20070711.1331.LDC2009T13	Okah, the Rivers state spokesman, said no ransom was paid to secure the freedom Sunday of British 3-year-old Margaret Hill, the first foreign child snatched in the region.
8200	APW_ENG_20070711.1331.LDC2009T13	He said the state government no longer doles out cash from shadowy slush funds following a federal order last year prohibited ransom payments.
8201	APW_ENG_20070711.1331.LDC2009T13	In 2006, the Rivers state government allocated nearly US$40 million as a "security vote," up from $US27 million the year before.
8202	APW_ENG_20070711.1331.LDC2009T13	No records are available on how the money has been spent or how much has been allocated this year.
8203	APW_ENG_20070711.1331.LDC2009T13	"In the early stage, the state government facilitated releases," Okah acknowledged.
8204	APW_ENG_20070711.1331.LDC2009T13	"Now, it's individuals ... who pay ransoms."
8205	APW_ENG_20070711.1331.LDC2009T13	And the kidnappings are escalating.
8206	APW_ENG_20070711.1331.LDC2009T13	Two foreigners were taken captive Sunday, and five seized last Wednesday were held for a week before being released, police said.
8207	APW_ENG_20070711.1331.LDC2009T13	And expatriates aren't the only targets.
8208	APW_ENG_20070711.1331.LDC2009T13	Two senior Nigerian managers of Royal Dutch Shell PLC were seized last Saturday before being released Wednesday, according to colleagues, and two Nigerian toddlers have been taken captive in the past.
8209	APW_ENG_20070711.1331.LDC2009T13	Nigeria is second only to Iraq as the country with the greatest risk of kidnap of foreign workers, the firm ASI Global Response says.
8210	APW_ENG_20070711.1331.LDC2009T13	The root causes behind the kidnappings -- poverty, corruption and lawlessness -- must be tackled before the country degenerates into a Colombia-style situation in which any wealthy person is a potential victim, regardless of employer or nationality, said Dimieari von Kemedi, a human rights lawyer working in the Delta.
8211	APW_ENG_20070711.1331.LDC2009T13	"A time may come when anyone wearing a tie is a target," he warned.

8221	APW_ENG_20070711.1480.LDC2009T13	ERIE, Pennsylvania 2007-07-11 19:03:24 UTC
8222	APW_ENG_20070711.1480.LDC2009T13	A pizza deliveryman who robbed a bank and was killed when the bomb around his neck exploded was not a hostage -- he was a conspirator in the plot, federal authorities said Wednesday.
8223	APW_ENG_20070711.1480.LDC2009T13	The deliveryman, Brian Wells, 46, had told police before the bomb exploded in August 2003 that he was an innocent victim and had been forced by gunmen to rob the bank.
8224	APW_ENG_20070711.1480.LDC2009T13	However, in the indictments unsealed Wednesday, Wells is named as a co-conspirator in the bizarre case.
8225	APW_ENG_20070711.1480.LDC2009T13	Two other people, Marjorie Diehl-Armstrong and her friend, Kenneth E. Barnes, are charged with bank robbery and conspiracy.
8226	APW_ENG_20070711.1480.LDC2009T13	Authorities said the plot was concocted so Diehl-Armstrong, 58, could pay someone to kill her father.
8227	APW_ENG_20070711.1480.LDC2009T13	Diehl-Armstrong and Barnes are accused of contriving a series of notes to make Wells appear to be "merely a hostage," according to the indictments.
8228	APW_ENG_20070711.1480.LDC2009T13	Their plan was to get the money from Wells in a way that if he was caught, he could claim he was an unwilling participant, authorities said in court papers.
8229	APW_ENG_20070711.1480.LDC2009T13	According to the indictments, they locked a live bomb onto Well's neck to ensure he followed their instructions and turned over the money.
8230	APW_ENG_20070711.1480.LDC2009T13	"If he died, he could not be a witness," authorities said in the indictment.
8231	APW_ENG_20070711.1480.LDC2009T13	U.S. Attorney Mary Beth Buchanan described Wells as having a limited role in the plot and couldn't comment on what his motive might have been for being involved.
8232	APW_ENG_20070711.1480.LDC2009T13	The bomb that killed Wells was on a timer but it was unclear if his co-conspirators planned on his death, she said.
8233	APW_ENG_20070711.1480.LDC2009T13	"Sadly, the plans of these other individuals were much more sinister ... and he died as a result," Buchanan said.
8234	APW_ENG_20070711.1480.LDC2009T13	"It may be that his role transitioned from that of the planing stages to being an unwilling participant in the scheme."
8235	APW_ENG_20070711.1480.LDC2009T13	Diehl-Armstrong is currently serving a state prison sentence for killing her boyfriend, James Roden.
8236	APW_ENG_20070711.1480.LDC2009T13	In the indictment, authorities say she killed Roden to keep him from disclosing details of the robbery plot.
8237	APW_ENG_20070711.1480.LDC2009T13	Barnes, 53, is jailed in Erie County on unrelated drug charges.
8238	APW_ENG_20070711.1480.LDC2009T13	Authorities have described him as Diehl-Armstrong's fishing companion.
8239	APW_ENG_20070711.1480.LDC2009T13	Diehl-Armstrong was notified Tuesday that she may face charges of bank robbery, conspiracy and a firearms count, lawyer Lawrence D'Ambrosio said.
8240	APW_ENG_20070711.1480.LDC2009T13	He says she is innocent.
8241	APW_ENG_20070711.1480.LDC2009T13	Wells set out to deliver an order for two pizzas to a mysterious address that turned out to be the location of a TV tower on Aug. 28, 2003.
8242	APW_ENG_20070711.1480.LDC2009T13	He turned up about an hour later and roughly 2 miles (3 kilometers) away at a PNC Bank branch, with a note demanding money and saying he had a bomb.
8243	APW_ENG_20070711.1480.LDC2009T13	Wells took the money from a teller, got into his car and was soon captured by police.
8244	APW_ENG_20070711.1480.LDC2009T13	Hanging from his neck under his T-shirt was a triple-banded metal collar and a device with a locking mechanism that kept it in place.
8245	APW_ENG_20070711.1480.LDC2009T13	Attached to the collar was a bomb.
8246	APW_ENG_20070711.1480.LDC2009T13	"It's going to go off," Wells said.
8247	APW_ENG_20070711.1480.LDC2009T13	"I'm not lying."
8248	APW_ENG_20070711.1480.LDC2009T13	He said someone had started a timer on the bomb and forced him to rob the bank.
8249	APW_ENG_20070711.1480.LDC2009T13	While police waited for a bomb squad, the bomb exploded, killing Wells.
8250	APW_ENG_20070711.1480.LDC2009T13	Police found a gun resembling a cane in the car and a nine-page handwritten letter that included detailed instructions on what Wells was to do with the bank money and how he could unlock the collar by going through a kind of scavenger hunt, looking for clues and landmarks.
8251	APW_ENG_20070711.1480.LDC2009T13	The note also included a list of rules and a threat that Wells would be "destroyed" if he failed to complete his mission.
8252	APW_ENG_20070711.1480.LDC2009T13	Buchanan said Wednesday that while Wells was in the bank, Diehl- Armstrong and Barnes had watched from across the street, and Diehl-Armstrong was later seen twice along the route described in the notes.
8253	APW_ENG_20070711.1480.LDC2009T13	Jim Sadowski, a former co-worker of Wells, said he does not believe his friend could have been involved.
8254	APW_ENG_20070711.1480.LDC2009T13	"I worked with him and I knew him.
8255	APW_ENG_20070711.1480.LDC2009T13	I just don't see him doing anything like that.
8256	APW_ENG_20070711.1480.LDC2009T13	He was a nice person," Sadowski said.
8257	APW_ENG_20070711.1480.LDC2009T13	Diehl-Armstrong has been linked to the Wells investigation because her boyfriend's body was found in the freezer of a home near the TV tower where Wells made his final delivery.
8258	APW_ENG_20070711.1480.LDC2009T13	She pleaded guilty but mentally ill to killing her boyfriend and is serving a sentence of seven to 20 years in state prison.
8259	APW_ENG_20070711.1480.LDC2009T13	The man who owned the home, William Rothstein, was questioned in Wells' death but has since died of cancer.
8260	APW_ENG_20070711.1480.LDC2009T13	D'Ambrosio, Diehl-Armstrong's attorney, has said he believes she had nothing to do with Wells' death but may have known the people behind the robbery.

8265	APW_ENG_20070714.0794.LDC2009T13	Fourth-seeded Fabrice Santoro defeated Wesley Moodie, 7-6 (2), 6-3, on Saturday to set up the first all-French final in the 31-year history of the Hall of Fame Tennis Championships.
8266	APW_ENG_20070714.0794.LDC2009T13	Santoro will face No. 5 seed Nicolas Mahut, who beat Dick Norman, 6-4, 6-7 (2), 6-2, in the opening semifinal earlier Saturday.
8267	APW_ENG_20070714.0794.LDC2009T13	"A good day for the French.
8268	APW_ENG_20070714.0794.LDC2009T13	A good week so far," Santoro said.
8269	APW_ENG_20070714.0794.LDC2009T13	"We warmed up together this morning and we said it would be nice if we played the final together."
8270	APW_ENG_20070714.0794.LDC2009T13	Santoro, who relied on two-handed cuts, slices and well-placed lobs, completed the victorious pairing for the French on Bastille Day when he closed out Moodie at love in the final game.
8271	APW_ENG_20070714.0794.LDC2009T13	It's his first final since 2002 in Dubai, where he won his fourth ATP title.
8272	APW_ENG_20070714.0794.LDC2009T13	"His nickname is the magician," Mahut said of his countryman.

8275	APW_ENG_20070714.0794.LDC2009T13	Mahut, a winner in 10 of 12 matches, advanced to his second career final.
8276	APW_ENG_20070714.0794.LDC2009T13	He lost the other to Andy Roddick at London-Queens Club last month.

8279	APW_ENG_20070714.0794.LDC2009T13	In the first semi, Mahut broke Norman in the fourth game of the third set to go up 3-1.
8280	APW_ENG_20070714.0794.LDC2009T13	He closed out the fifth and seventh games with aces, taking a 5-2 edge.

8289	APW_ENG_20070716.0794.LDC2009T13	Polish President Lech Kaczynski and President George W. Bush were to discuss plans Monday to build a U.S. missile defense base on Polish soil-- a possibility that has rankled relations for both countries with Moscow.
8290	APW_ENG_20070716.0794.LDC2009T13	The White House meeting comes just days after Russia began a process to freeze a key European arms control treaty in apparent anger over the plan.
8291	APW_ENG_20070716.0794.LDC2009T13	Bush and Kaczynski also are expected to discuss their countries' alliance in Afghanistan and Iraq, where Poland has 900 troops.
8292	APW_ENG_20070716.0794.LDC2009T13	Warsaw is still deciding whether to bring its soldiers home from Iraq by year's end, as planned.
8293	APW_ENG_20070716.0794.LDC2009T13	The two leaders are likely to touch on Poland's wish to be included in a program that allows Europeans to enter the U.S. without visas.
8294	APW_ENG_20070716.0794.LDC2009T13	But missile defense, which has become a much more sensitive issue in recent months as Russia has intensified its opposition, is likely to dominate the talks.
8295	APW_ENG_20070716.0794.LDC2009T13	Washington says the planned system would protect most of the continent from long-range missile strikes from Iran.

8298	APW_ENG_20070716.0794.LDC2009T13	Russian officials have also threatened to retarget its missiles toward Europe to counter the proposed missile defense installations.
8299	APW_ENG_20070716.0794.LDC2009T13	Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Saturday his country would suspend its compliance with the Conventional Forces in Europe Treaty after 150 days.

8303	APW_ENG_20070719.0247.LDC2009T13	Oil prices retreated Thursday after closing the previous session above US$75 a barrel on an unexpected decline in U.S. gasoline inventories.

8307	APW_ENG_20070719.0247.LDC2009T13	The average expectation had been for a 560,000-barrel gain, according to an earlier Dow Jones Newswires survey of analysts.
8308	APW_ENG_20070719.0247.LDC2009T13	Gasoline demand over the previous four weeks has surged to record levels, keeping the fuel as one of the leading drivers of oil prices.
8309	APW_ENG_20070719.0247.LDC2009T13	Gasoline supplies have been a concern since a round of refinery outages in the spring left the U.S. with supplies deemed insufficient for the North American summer driving season.
8310	APW_ENG_20070719.0247.LDC2009T13	Stockpiles of crude oil and distillates, which include heating oil and diesel fuel, also fell last week.

8315	APW_ENG_20070719.0247.LDC2009T13	Operating rates are still lower than normal for this time of the year.
8316	APW_ENG_20070719.0247.LDC2009T13	U.S. refinery outages in the lead up to the summer driving season have been a major factor the past six months in crude oil's 45 percent gain from around US$50 a barrel.
8317	APW_ENG_20070719.0247.LDC2009T13	U.S. gasoline demand in the four weeks ended July 13 was 9.626 million barrels a day, the Energy Information Agency's data show, a gain of 1.3 percent from a year ago and the highest on record for any four-week period.

8322	APW_ENG_20070720.0539.LDC2009T13	TAIPEI, Taiwan 2007-07-20 09:04:47 UTC
8323	APW_ENG_20070720.0539.LDC2009T13	Taiwanese presidential candidate Frank Hsieh set off on a 10-day visit to the United States Friday, expected to provide American officials a firsthand opportunity to hear his views on the key issue of relations with rival China.
8324	APW_ENG_20070720.0539.LDC2009T13	Hsieh's trip comes against the background of rising unease in Washington over plans by Taiwanese President Chen Shui-bian to hold a referendum on Taiwan's entry into the United Nations under its own name, a move that has been broadly condemned by Beijing.
8325	APW_ENG_20070720.0539.LDC2009T13	Hsieh won the presidential nomination of Chen's Democratic Progressive Party in May, and is set to face Ma Ying-jeou of the main opposition Nationalists in the presidential poll next March.
8326	APW_ENG_20070720.0539.LDC2009T13	Analysts believe his cross-strait views are more moderate than those of Chen, who has made no secret of his desire to formalize Taiwan's de facto independence.
8327	APW_ENG_20070720.0539.LDC2009T13	Although Taiwan and China split amid civil war in 1949, Beijing continues to view the island as part of its territory and has threatened to attack if it ever makes the break permanent.
8328	APW_ENG_20070720.0539.LDC2009T13	Hsieh spokesman Sky Chao said the main purpose of Hsieh's trip was to open communication channels with the United States and to develop confidence between the Hsieh camp and official Washington.
8329	APW_ENG_20070720.0539.LDC2009T13	"In the past it was unavoidable that U.S. and Taiwan had different stands on issues, and communications did not go well," he said.
8330	APW_ENG_20070720.0539.LDC2009T13	"We hope this time we can remedy that situation."
8331	APW_ENG_20070720.0539.LDC2009T13	Chao declined to say who Hsieh planned to meet in the U.S. capital, but Taiwanese media have reported one of his interlocutors will be Undersecretary of State Nicholas Burns.
8332	APW_ENG_20070720.0539.LDC2009T13	The American Institute in Taiwan -- the de facto U.S. Embassy on the island -- would not provide details on Hsieh's Washington itinerary.
8333	APW_ENG_20070720.0539.LDC2009T13	Tai-shuenn Yang of Taipei's Chinese Culture University said American officials were anxious to hear if Hsieh was really more moderate than Chen on cross-strait relations.
8334	APW_ENG_20070720.0539.LDC2009T13	"In the past few years, President Chen has taken some unpredictable steps, and the U.S. is concerned whether the new DPP leader will continue in (his path)," he said.
8335	APW_ENG_20070720.0539.LDC2009T13	"The U.S. wants to know enough to be able to make objective assessment about the 2008 elections."
8336	APW_ENG_20070720.0539.LDC2009T13	In February 2006 Chen scrapped a government body responsible for eventual unification with the mainland, infuriating Beijing, and causing great concern in Washington, which fears being drawn into a conflict in the western Pacific.
8337	APW_ENG_20070720.0539.LDC2009T13	His determination to move ahead with the U.N referendum is causing similar concern, because it appears to signal a desire to dispense with Taiwan's official title of "The Republic of China," and carve out a long-term identity separate from the mainland.
8338	APW_ENG_20070720.0539.LDC2009T13	As Hsieh's campaign begins to gather momentum, he may be torn between the demands of hardcore DPP supporters to identify with the pro-independence line, and the preference of centrist voters to continue the island's politically ambivalent status quo.
8339	APW_ENG_20070720.0539.LDC2009T13	It will not be an easy balancing act for the 61-year-old lawyer, who as mayor of the southern city of Kaohsiung from 1998 to 2005 pushed for exchanges with the nearby Chinese city of Xiamen and tried to promote better relations with Beijing under the slogan "coexistence and reconciliation."

8342	APW_ENG_20070720.1232.LDC2009T13	These are lean times for Lefty in the majors.
8343	APW_ENG_20070720.1232.LDC2009T13	Phil Mickelson came to the 18th hole at the British Open figuring he needed par to avoid missing his second straight cut in a major.
8344	APW_ENG_20070720.1232.LDC2009T13	He set his feet, had one last look down the fairway, took a mighty swing with the driver and watched the ball sail into the iron gray skies.
8345	APW_ENG_20070720.1232.LDC2009T13	Only to splash into the Barry Burn.
8346	APW_ENG_20070720.1232.LDC2009T13	Mickelson ended another frustrating round at Carnoustie on Friday with a double bogey on his last hole for a 6-over 77, leaving him in jeopardy of missing the cut at 6-over 148.
8347	APW_ENG_20070720.1232.LDC2009T13	"I thought I was playing better than this," Mickelson said.
8348	APW_ENG_20070720.1232.LDC2009T13	He had every reason to believe that.
8349	APW_ENG_20070720.1232.LDC2009T13	Five days ago, Mickelson was on the verge of winning the Scottish Open until he blew a lead on the back nine, then lost to unheralded Gregory Havret of France on the first playoff hole at Loch Lomond.
8350	APW_ENG_20070720.1232.LDC2009T13	Even so, it was his first time in contention, or even playing all four rounds, since winning The Players Championship in May.
8351	APW_ENG_20070720.1232.LDC2009T13	Was this a step back?
8352	APW_ENG_20070720.1232.LDC2009T13	"I don't know.
8353	APW_ENG_20070720.1232.LDC2009T13	It's hard to say," Mickelson said.
8354	APW_ENG_20070720.1232.LDC2009T13	"I've missed a lot of cuts lately.
8355	APW_ENG_20070720.1232.LDC2009T13	I missed U.S. Open, Congressional, most likely here.
8356	APW_ENG_20070720.1232.LDC2009T13	I better get better.
8357	APW_ENG_20070720.1232.LDC2009T13	I think my next tournament doesn't have a cut, so that will be nice."
8358	APW_ENG_20070720.1232.LDC2009T13	That would be a World Golf Championship at Firestone.
8359	APW_ENG_20070720.1232.LDC2009T13	The following week is the PGA Championship at Southern Hills, which will be Mickelson's final chance to continue his streak of winning a major each year that dates to his first one at the 2004 Masters.
8360	APW_ENG_20070720.1232.LDC2009T13	As well as he plays Southern Hills, this is not an upward trend.
8361	APW_ENG_20070720.1232.LDC2009T13	The 77 on Friday was the ninth straight round at a major that Mickelson failed to break par, his longest stretch since he played par or worse the final nine rounds of the 1999 season, which included a missed cut at Carnoustie.
8362	APW_ENG_20070720.1232.LDC2009T13	Mickelson no longer blames the left wrist he supposedly injured at Oakmont, rather his putting.
8363	APW_ENG_20070720.1232.LDC2009T13	"I was just never on line," he said.
8364	APW_ENG_20070720.1232.LDC2009T13	It was evident on the 15th hole, where Mickelson three-putted from about 60 feet (18 meters) to fall to 4 over par.
8365	APW_ENG_20070720.1232.LDC2009T13	First, he had caddie Jim "Bones" Mackay stand over the ball to make sure the line was the same as Mickelson had in mind.
8366	APW_ENG_20070720.1232.LDC2009T13	Lefty grazed the left edge of the cup, then missed the 4-foot (1.2 meter) comeback putt.
8367	APW_ENG_20070720.1232.LDC2009T13	He held the putter at both ends, looking as though he wanted to snap it in half.
8368	APW_ENG_20070720.1232.LDC2009T13	And while he made solid par save from deep grass behind the 17th green, his round ended on a sour note.
8369	APW_ENG_20070720.1232.LDC2009T13	After taking a drop the burn down the left side of the fairway, Mickelson hit 3-wood to the front of the green and left his first putt 4 feet (1.2 meters) short.
8370	APW_ENG_20070720.1232.LDC2009T13	The bogey putt never even touched the hole.
8371	APW_ENG_20070720.1232.LDC2009T13	"It was a really fair test," Mickelson said.
8372	APW_ENG_20070720.1232.LDC2009T13	"There were under- par scores out there, I just didn't putt well enough to have one of them."
8373	APW_ENG_20070720.1232.LDC2009T13	He also ran into rule that applies only at the British Open.
8374	APW_ENG_20070720.1232.LDC2009T13	Mickelson's approach to the second hole was imbedded in the right rough, and when a ball is plugged, players usually get free relief.
8375	APW_ENG_20070720.1232.LDC2009T13	The British Open rule is that imbedded lies only apply to those in the closely mown areas of the course.
8376	APW_ENG_20070720.1232.LDC2009T13	Mickelson had to put the ball back, then took a penalty drop for an unplayable lie.
8377	APW_ENG_20070720.1232.LDC2009T13	The slope was so steep that he dropped it twice and watched it roll closer to the hole, then had trouble making the ball stay put even after he placed it.
8378	APW_ENG_20070720.1232.LDC2009T13	He walked up to the green, and a few seconds later, the ball rolled into a beautiful lie short of the green, but no closer to the hole.
8379	APW_ENG_20070720.1232.LDC2009T13	It was a good break, even though it still led to bogey.
8380	APW_ENG_20070720.1232.LDC2009T13	"The rule is it has to be stationary five seconds, which it was," Mickelson said.
8381	APW_ENG_20070720.1232.LDC2009T13	"And then after a minute or so, you just play it where it lies unless I had addressed it, which I never did."
8382	APW_ENG_20070720.1232.LDC2009T13	Then he paused to smile.
8383	APW_ENG_20070720.1232.LDC2009T13	"Because I felt like it might roll," he added.
8384	APW_ENG_20070720.1232.LDC2009T13	That was about the only thing that went right for him Friday.

8386	APW_ENG_20070723.0564.LDC2009T13	BRUSSELS, Belgium 2007-07-23 12:56:50 UTC
8387	APW_ENG_20070723.0564.LDC2009T13	EU regulators on Monday warned Austria that it cannot ban heavy trucks from an Alpine highway linking the country with Germany.
8388	APW_ENG_20070723.0564.LDC2009T13	Authorities in the Tyrol want to stop heavy lorries traveling through the Inn valley in an effort to limit nitrogen dioxide emissions from road transport.
8389	APW_ENG_20070723.0564.LDC2009T13	The proposed ban would cover any truck carrying waste, grain, timber, stones, rubble, cars, steel and ceramic tiles.
8390	APW_ENG_20070723.0564.LDC2009T13	But the European Commission said that would break EU rules guaranteeing the free movement of goods anywhere in the 27-nation bloc.
8391	APW_ENG_20070723.0564.LDC2009T13	The transport of these goods could not easily switch to rail freight, it said, and the ban would not hugely improve air quality.
8392	APW_ENG_20070723.0564.LDC2009T13	Austria has been trying for years to control polluting truck traffic through its territory, a vital link for truckers bringing goods between the industrial heartland of Germany and markets in Italy and parts of Eastern Europe.
8393	APW_ENG_20070723.0564.LDC2009T13	Two years ago, the EU's highest court ruled against a similar ban on the same A12 highway, saying it went too far and Austria should have tried softer measures first.
8394	APW_ENG_20070723.0564.LDC2009T13	The EU executive said it would support environmental laws banning older or more polluting lorries or introducing speed limits for cars -- words meant for Germany where highways have no upper speed limit.

8397	APW_ENG_20070726.0328.LDC2009T13	A top envoy from South Korea headed to Afghanistan on Thursday, scrambling to save 22 South Koreans held captive by Taliban kidnappers after the militants killed one hostage.
8398	APW_ENG_20070726.0328.LDC2009T13	An Afghan police chief ruled out using force to free the remaining captive and said that Afghan negotiators were speaking with the Taliban over the phone, hoping to secure their release.
8399	APW_ENG_20070726.0328.LDC2009T13	On Wednesday, authorities found the bullet-riddled body of 42 -year-old Bae Hyung-kyu in Qarabagh district of Ghazni province where the South Koreans were abducted July 19.
8400	APW_ENG_20070726.0328.LDC2009T13	The victim was found with 10 bullet holes in his head, chest and stomach, said Abdul Rahman, a police officer.
8401	APW_ENG_20070726.0328.LDC2009T13	Another Afghan police official, who asked not to be identified because of the sensitivity of the situation, said militants told him the hostage was sick and couldn't walk and was therefore shot.
8402	APW_ENG_20070726.0328.LDC2009T13	The kidnappers "will be held accountable for taking the life of a Korean citizen," Baek Jong-chun, South Korea's chief presidential secretary for security affairs, said in a statement, before departing for Afghanistan to consult with top Afghan officials on how to secure the release of the remaining captives.
8403	APW_ENG_20070726.0328.LDC2009T13	After conflicting reports Wednesday from Western and Afghan officials that possibly eight of the other hostages had been released, South Korean presidential spokesman Chun Ho-sun said the 22 were still believed held but not suffering from health problems.
8404	APW_ENG_20070726.0328.LDC2009T13	Chun said South Korean President Roh Moo-hyun had spoken with his Afghan counterpart Hamid Karzai, but did not disclose the contents of their discussion.
8405	APW_ENG_20070726.0328.LDC2009T13	Ghazni police chief Ali Shah Ahmadzai said that the Afghan negotiators were speaking with the Taliban over the phone, in a hope of securing the hostages release.
8406	APW_ENG_20070726.0328.LDC2009T13	"We will not use force against the militants to free the hostages," he said.
8407	APW_ENG_20070726.0328.LDC2009T13	"The best way in this case is dialogue."
8408	APW_ENG_20070726.0328.LDC2009T13	"We are hopeful that by noon today we will reach some sort of deal for the release of six up to eight people," Ahmadzai said, without giving more explanation for his optimism.
8409	APW_ENG_20070726.0328.LDC2009T13	Chun said that both governments were cooperating and that an Afghan official had told South Korea earlier Thursday that Kabul intended to negotiate with the Taliban.
8410	APW_ENG_20070726.0328.LDC2009T13	He said Seoul was aware of the Taliban's current demands but declined to specify them.
8411	APW_ENG_20070726.0328.LDC2009T13	Seoul also repeated its call that no rescue mission be launched that could endanger the captives further.
8412	APW_ENG_20070726.0328.LDC2009T13	"We oppose military operations and there won't be military operations that we do not consent to," Chun said.
8413	APW_ENG_20070726.0328.LDC2009T13	Marajudin Pathan, the governor of Ghazni province, said militants have given a list of eight Taliban prisoners who they want released in exchange for eight Koreans.
8414	APW_ENG_20070726.0328.LDC2009T13	An Afghan official involved in the negotiations earlier said a large sum of money would be paid to free eight of the hostages.
8415	APW_ENG_20070726.0328.LDC2009T13	The official also spoke on condition he not be identified, citing the matter's sensitivity.
8416	APW_ENG_20070726.0328.LDC2009T13	No other officials would confirm this account.
8417	APW_ENG_20070726.0328.LDC2009T13	Foreign governments are suspected to have paid for the release of hostages in Afghanistan in the past, but have either kept it quiet or denied it outright.
8418	APW_ENG_20070726.0328.LDC2009T13	The Taliban at one point demanded that 23 jailed militants be freed in exchange for the Koreans.
8419	APW_ENG_20070726.0328.LDC2009T13	The South Koreans, including 18 women, were kidnapped while on a bus trip through Ghazni province on the Kabul-Kandahar highway, Afghanistan's main thoroughfare.
8420	APW_ENG_20070726.0328.LDC2009T13	South Korea has banned its citizens from traveling to Afghanistan in the wake of the kidnappings.
8421	APW_ENG_20070726.0328.LDC2009T13	Seoul also asked Kabul not to issue visas to South Koreans and to block their entry into the country.
8422	APW_ENG_20070726.0328.LDC2009T13	Because of a recent spike in kidnappings of foreigners -- including an attempt against a Danish citizen Wednesday -- Afghan police announced that foreigners were no longer allowed to leave the Afghan capital without their permission.
8423	APW_ENG_20070726.0328.LDC2009T13	The South Korean church that the abductees attend has said it will suspend at least some of its volunteer work in Afghanistan.
8424	APW_ENG_20070726.0328.LDC2009T13	It also stressed that the Koreans abducted were not involved in any Christian missionary work, saying they provided only medical and other volunteer aid to distressed people in the war-ravaged country.

8431	APW_ENG_20070727.0800.LDC2009T13	LONDON 2007-07-27 13:37:36 UTC
8432	APW_ENG_20070727.0800.LDC2009T13	Former heavyweight boxer James Oyebola died Friday, four days after being shot in the head following a dispute about smoking at a London bar, police said.
8433	APW_ENG_20070727.0800.LDC2009T13	Doctors turned off life-support systems after determining that Oyebola's brain was dead.
8434	APW_ENG_20070727.0800.LDC2009T13	Oyebola, 47, a native of Nigeria, was a bronze medalist at the 1986 Commonwealth Games and won the World Boxing Council international heavyweight title in 1993.
8435	APW_ENG_20070727.0800.LDC2009T13	He retired from the ring in 1996.
8436	APW_ENG_20070727.0800.LDC2009T13	Metropolitan Police said the 6-foot, 9-inch (206-centimeter-tall) boxer apparently tried to intervene in a dispute between staff at a west London bar and three customers, reportedly about enforcing the recent ban on smoking in public places.
8437	APW_ENG_20070727.0800.LDC2009T13	The argument, which occurred just after midnight Sunday, involved three men and security over smoking in the covered courtyard at the rear of the premises.

8442	APW_ENG_20070731.0997.LDC2009T13	With much of Europe on holiday in August, the European Central Bank's Governing Council will chat by phone Thursday about the state of the economy in the 13 countries that use the euro, mindful of the recent volatility in global stock markets.
8443	APW_ENG_20070731.0997.LDC2009T13	But experts are mixed on whether that will give the ECB a reason to put off an increase widely expected for next month, or for the Bank of England to hold off on another rate increase.
8444	APW_ENG_20070731.0997.LDC2009T13	Some are convinced that the subprime woes affecting U.S. markets -- which have spilled into sharp but short-lived declines on world markets -- are limited in their reach beyond American borders.
8445	APW_ENG_20070731.0997.LDC2009T13	"U.K. and euro-zone housing markets have their own dynamics and the same lenders are neither involved nor are the same lending practices or standards identical," said Andrew Wilkinson of Interactive Brokers in the United States.
8446	APW_ENG_20070731.0997.LDC2009T13	"In other words, this is a U.S. problem."
8447	APW_ENG_20070731.0997.LDC2009T13	The stock market rebound this week follows last week's sharp plunge, which was fueled by persistent worries that a deteriorating lending environment will make it harder for companies to borrow money.
8448	APW_ENG_20070731.0997.LDC2009T13	Investors are still nervous about the risk of a global credit crunch, leading to thoughts that central banks in Europe -- eager to avoid any fanning of the flames of concern and panic -- could ease off on their approach toward rate hikes.
8449	APW_ENG_20070731.0997.LDC2009T13	Both the ECB and BoE have indicated that a re-evaluation of market risk would be a positive development.
8450	APW_ENG_20070731.0997.LDC2009T13	ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet told German newspaper Die Zeit last week that the major market moves had been nothing more than a "healthy correction," and that while it was not a big detractor to the bank's mission of keeping inflation at bay, neither was it a sign to ignore.
8451	APW_ENG_20070731.0997.LDC2009T13	"In a number of segments in the global finance system we have observed in the past a certain under-appreciation of risks," he told the newspaper in the interview published July 23.
8452	APW_ENG_20070731.0997.LDC2009T13	"That was visible in the low level of volatility, the low level of spreads, the low level of risk premiums.
8453	APW_ENG_20070731.0997.LDC2009T13	During the last weeks we saw a correction.
8454	APW_ENG_20070731.0997.LDC2009T13	At the moment I would say it has been a healthy correction.
8455	APW_ENG_20070731.0997.LDC2009T13	But I remain cautious: It is no time for complacency."
8456	APW_ENG_20070731.0997.LDC2009T13	Inflation in the euro zone -- the 13 nations with more than 317 million residents that account for more than 15 percent of the world's economic growth -- has been within the ECB's guidelines of just under 2 percent.
8457	APW_ENG_20070731.0997.LDC2009T13	The EU statistics agency said Tuesday that the inflation in the euro area eased to 1.8 percent in July from last month's 1.9 percent and that unemployment in both the 27-nation European Union and the euro area held steady in June at a record low of 6.9 percent.
8458	APW_ENG_20070731.0997.LDC2009T13	That may be enough for rate hike proponents to clamor for an increase sooner rather than later, said Gilles Moec, an economist with Bank of America in London.
8459	APW_ENG_20070731.0997.LDC2009T13	"The hawks will probably focus on the continuation of the fall in the euro zone's unemployment rate to 6.9 percent in July, the lowest level ever recorded since the start of the series in 1990, arguing that the tensions on the labor market will eventually trigger a sharp increase in wage costs," he said in a research note to investors.
8460	APW_ENG_20070731.0997.LDC2009T13	However, he said that much of that improvement can be ascribed to structural factors, such as flexible labor contracts in Germany and Italy.
8461	APW_ENG_20070731.0997.LDC2009T13	"It would therefore probably be a mistake to assess the impact of the recent decline in the unemployment figures on wage costs on the basis of the experiences of the 1980s and 1990s," Moec said.
8462	APW_ENG_20070731.0997.LDC2009T13	Eurostat also said business confidence weakened from its near- record high -- but the euro remains within 2 cents of its recent all-time high of US$1.3852.

8468	APW_ENG_20070731.1207.LDC2009T13	TALLAHASSEE, Florida 2007-07-31 18:40:20 UTC
8469	APW_ENG_20070731.1207.LDC2009T13	Florida's optical scan voting machines are still flawed, despite efforts to fix them, and they could allow poll workers to tamper with the election results, according to a government-ordered study obtained Tuesday by The Associated Press.
8470	APW_ENG_20070731.1207.LDC2009T13	The state banned punch cards and replaced them with optical scan and touch-screen voting machines after its voting system drew national attention in 2000, when unclear ballots held up a final count in the presidential election.
8471	APW_ENG_20070731.1207.LDC2009T13	The state was eventually decided by 537 votes after the U.S. Supreme Court stepped in, handing the election to the Repubilcan candidate, George W. Bush.
8472	APW_ENG_20070731.1207.LDC2009T13	But, optical scan machines have proven to have problems.
8473	APW_ENG_20070731.1207.LDC2009T13	At the request of the secretary of state, Florida State University's information technology laboratory went over a list of previously discovered flaws on optical voting scan machines to see if they are still vulnerable to attack.
8474	APW_ENG_20070731.1207.LDC2009T13	"While the vendor has fixed many of these flaws, many important vulnerabilities remain unaddressed," the report said.
8475	APW_ENG_20070731.1207.LDC2009T13	The lab found, for example, that someone with only brief access to the machines could replace a memory card with one preprogramed to read one candidate's votes as counting for another, essentially switching the candidates and showing the loser winning.
8476	APW_ENG_20070731.1207.LDC2009T13	"The attack can be carried out with a reasonably low probability of detection assuming that audits with paper ballots are infrequent," the report said.
8477	APW_ENG_20070731.1207.LDC2009T13	Secretary of State Kurt Browning is asking Diebold Elections Systems to address the problems.
8478	APW_ENG_20070731.1207.LDC2009T13	Currently, 15 of Florida's 67 counties use paperless touch-screen voting machines.
8479	APW_ENG_20070731.1207.LDC2009T13	The remaining counties use optical scan machines where a voter marks a paper ballot with a pencil and it is electronically scanned.
8480	APW_ENG_20070731.1207.LDC2009T13	A newly signed state law requires a verifiable paper trail for all voting machines.

8492	APW_ENG_20070803.0567.LDC2009T13	A member of Ahmed's medical team said the suspect was in a coma during his entire time in hospital and he did not think police had been able to interview him.

8497	APW_ENG_20070803.0567.LDC2009T13	Three other people have been charged over the attacks, which prompted the government to raise Britain's threat status from "severe" to "critical," the highest level.

8511	APW_ENG_20070804.0049.LDC2009T13	WASHINGTON 2007-08-04 00:15:13 UTC
8512	APW_ENG_20070804.0049.LDC2009T13	Congress and the White House struggled over expanding authority to eavesdrop on suspected foreign terrorists in a high-stakes showdown over national security.
8513	APW_ENG_20070804.0049.LDC2009T13	"We're still hopeful that something can be worked out," said Ellen Cioccio, a spokeswoman for Director of National Intelligence Mike McConnell, after a day of fitful negotiations Friday.
8514	APW_ENG_20070804.0049.LDC2009T13	"They're still talking."
8515	APW_ENG_20070804.0049.LDC2009T13	Democratic leaders cleared the way for votes on different measures -- at least two in the Senate and one in the House.
8516	APW_ENG_20070804.0049.LDC2009T13	That left the outcome in doubt hours after President George W. Bush implored Congress to send him a bill before leaving this weekend on a monthlong vacation.
8517	APW_ENG_20070804.0049.LDC2009T13	In the House, Democrats claimed they had acceded to White House requests, but Bush's aides disputed that.
8518	APW_ENG_20070804.0049.LDC2009T13	Two bills emerged in the Senate, one with White House support, the other without.
8519	APW_ENG_20070804.0049.LDC2009T13	In his remarks, Bush coupled his demand for legislation with a threat.
8520	APW_ENG_20070804.0049.LDC2009T13	He said would veto any bill by the Democratic-led Congress that his intelligence director deemed unable "to prevent an attack on the country."
8521	APW_ENG_20070804.0049.LDC2009T13	"We've worked hard and in good faith with the Democrats to find a solution, but we are not going to put our national security at risk," Bush said after meeting with counterterror and homeland security officials at FBI headquarters.
8522	APW_ENG_20070804.0049.LDC2009T13	"Time is short."
8523	APW_ENG_20070804.0049.LDC2009T13	The Bush administration began pressing for changes to the law after a recent ruling by the special Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, or FISA, court that barred the government from eavesdropping on foreign suspects whose messages were being routed through U.S. communications carriers, including Internet sites.
8524	APW_ENG_20070804.0049.LDC2009T13	Democrats agree the law should not restrict U.S. spies from tapping in on foreign suspects.
8525	APW_ENG_20070804.0049.LDC2009T13	However, they want the FISA court to review the eavesdropping process before it begins to make sure that Americans aren't targeted.

8656	APW_ENG_20070805.0106.LDC2009T13	HELENA, Montana 2007-08-05 02:00:59 UTC
8657	APW_ENG_20070805.0106.LDC2009T13	Authorities worried about firefighters' safety pulled them away from a fast-growing wildfire in western Montana, and told residents of some 200 homes to get out of the way.
8658	APW_ENG_20070805.0106.LDC2009T13	"This fire is in the hands of God right now," Governor Brian Schweitzer said Saturday after taking a helicopter flight over the blaze, which already had burned nearly 8 square miles (20.7 sq. kilometers) since starting Friday afternoon.
8659	APW_ENG_20070805.0106.LDC2009T13	Schweitzer said the wind-whipped fire was volatile and could grow rapidly, jeopardizing crews.
8660	APW_ENG_20070805.0106.LDC2009T13	There were no reports of homes burning, said Jamie Kirby, a fire information officer.
8661	APW_ENG_20070805.0106.LDC2009T13	It was not known how close the fire was to the houses, a mix of year-round and vacation homes.
8662	APW_ENG_20070805.0106.LDC2009T13	Montana has seen dozens of fires in a wildfire season that began earlier than usual in the U.S. West.
8663	APW_ENG_20070805.0106.LDC2009T13	Major fires included one north of Helena that was last measured at about 58 square miles (150.2 sq. kilometers), and was projected to grow Saturday with the help of winds.
8664	APW_ENG_20070805.0106.LDC2009T13	Northwest of Los Angeles, meanwhile, fire crews braced for another possible flare-up by a month-old forest fire that has forced hundreds of people to flee rural cabins.
8665	APW_ENG_20070805.0106.LDC2009T13	"It's not good.
8666	APW_ENG_20070805.0106.LDC2009T13	We expect it to run again," fire spokesman Pete Nicklin said.
8667	APW_ENG_20070805.0106.LDC2009T13	The fire in Los Padres National Forest had charred an estimated 70 square miles (181.3 sq. kilometers) by Saturday and was 60 percent contained, little changed from Friday, fire officials said.
8668	APW_ENG_20070807.0411.LDC2009T13	Reports: Trials start in Shanghai fund scandal that brought down city ' s top official
8669	APW_ENG_20070807.0411.LDC2009T13	BEIJING 2007-08-07 08:17:52 UTC
8670	APW_ENG_20070807.0411.LDC2009T13	Trials have begun in a wide-ranging pension fund scandal in China's business hub of Shanghai that felled the city's top official, a magazine reported.
8671	APW_ENG_20070807.0411.LDC2009T13	Seven people have been indicted in Shanghai, with the trial of Wang Guoxiong, a manager with a city government investment arm, among those already under way, the highly regarded business weekly Caijing reported in its edition published Monday.
8672	APW_ENG_20070807.0411.LDC2009T13	Others face trials in the neighboring province of Anhui and the northern province of Jilin, where 14 officials and state industry managers are under indictment, including the head of Shanghai's social security bureau, it said.
8673	APW_ENG_20070807.0411.LDC2009T13	It wasn't immediately clear why those cases were being heard in Jilin, north of the capital Beijing.
8674	APW_ENG_20070807.0411.LDC2009T13	The highest official to fall in the case was Shanghai's powerful Communist Party secretary Chen Liangyu, who is reportedly in jail awaiting trial on corruption charges.
8675	APW_ENG_20070807.0411.LDC2009T13	Authorities announced last month that Chen had been kicked out of the party and removed from all government positions.
8676	APW_ENG_20070807.0411.LDC2009T13	Authorities have kept a tight lid on information about the scandal investigation, although the recent revelations seem to indicate it could be nearing a conclusion.
8677	APW_ENG_20070807.0411.LDC2009T13	The party is believed to want to wrap up those cases ahead of its twice-a-decade congress sometime later this year, at which president and party chief Hu Jintao will try to further entrench his rule and set the political and social agenda for the next five years.
8678	APW_ENG_20070807.0411.LDC2009T13	The scandal investigation and Chen's dismissal have been widely viewed as part of Hu's efforts to shove aside supporters of former party boss Jiang Zemin, whose political base was Shanghai.
8679	APW_ENG_20070807.0411.LDC2009T13	Chen, who had also been a member of the party's 24-seat Politburo, was among Jiang's most powerful allies.
8680	APW_ENG_20070807.0411.LDC2009T13	He is the highest-level Chinese official to be dismissed in a decade and is accused of being at the center of the high-profile scandal in which US$400 million (euro290 million) in pension funds were improperly invested in real estate and road toll projects.
8681	APW_ENG_20070807.0411.LDC2009T13	Dozens have been questioned or detained in the scandal, including Wang Weigong, a former secretary to Huang Ju, a member of the all-powerful nine-member Politburo Standing Committee who died of cancer in June.
8682	APW_ENG_20070807.0411.LDC2009T13	Wang has been suspended from his current job at a government power company for "severe discipline violations," a Shanghai government spokeswoman said on routine condition of anonymity.
8683	APW_ENG_20070807.0411.LDC2009T13	She said the investigation into Wang was continuing but gave no other details.
8684	APW_ENG_20070807.0411.LDC2009T13	Huang had served as the disgraced Chen's predecessor as both Shanghai mayor and party secretary, during which time he was assisted by Wang.
8685	APW_ENG_20070807.0411.LDC2009T13	Questions have been raised in past about Huang's possible involvement in the pension scandal, although no charges have ever been made.

8687	APW_ENG_20070809.1437.LDC2009T13	PITTSBURGH 2007-08-09 21:38:47 UTC
8688	APW_ENG_20070809.1437.LDC2009T13	The supermarket chain Giant Eagle Inc. won a bankruptcy court auction Thursday with a $20 million (euro14.57 million) bid to buy the shuttered Latrobe bottling facility of bankrupt drinks maker Le-Nature's Inc.
8689	APW_ENG_20070809.1437.LDC2009T13	The regional company edged out the beverage arm of U.K.-based Cadbury Schweppes PLC, which entered a $19 million (euro13.84 million) offer last week that it declined to increase during the brief hearing.
8690	APW_ENG_20070809.1437.LDC2009T13	Le-Nature's was forced into bankruptcy last year after a judge ruled that founder and chief executive Gregory J. Podlucky and other directors may have committed accounting fraud.
8691	APW_ENG_20070809.1437.LDC2009T13	A federal investigation is under way.
8692	APW_ENG_20070809.1437.LDC2009T13	The flagship plant closed in November, leaving 240 employees out of work.
8693	APW_ENG_20070809.1437.LDC2009T13	Creditors say the company racked up debts of more than $820 million (euro597.28 million), according to court documents.
8694	APW_ENG_20070809.1437.LDC2009T13	Giant Eagle plans to begin operating the facility in about eight weeks and hire some 50 people to work there, according to Dick Roberts, a spokesman for the company.
8695	APW_ENG_20070809.1437.LDC2009T13	Former Le-Nature's employees will be given special consideration, he said.
8696	APW_ENG_20070809.1437.LDC2009T13	"It's hoped numbers (of employees) will increase," he said.
8697	APW_ENG_20070809.1437.LDC2009T13	The facility about 35 miles (56 kms) southeast of Pittsburgh initially will be used to produce Giant Eagle's branded bottled water, teas and other beverages.
8698	APW_ENG_20070809.1437.LDC2009T13	It will also be used for outside contract work, Roberts said.
8699	APW_ENG_20070809.1437.LDC2009T13	A court-appointed trustee of Le-Nature's earlier agreed to sell the plant to Giant Eagle $20 million (euro14.57 million) before the company lowered its bid to $18.9 million (euro13.77 million) after reviewing the property.
8700	APW_ENG_20070809.1437.LDC2009T13	Daniel Shapira, an attorney representing the O'Hara Township- based chain, renewed the $20 million bid during Thursday's auction before U.S. Bankruptcy Court Chief Judge M. Bruce McCullough.
8701	APW_ENG_20070809.1437.LDC2009T13	He said the company had spent more than $500,000 (euro364,192) researching the proposed acquisition, which would include property, equipment, inventory and government permits, among other assets.
8702	APW_ENG_20070809.1437.LDC2009T13	The $20 million from the sale will be divided among creditors and companies that leased equipment to Le-Nature's.

8708	APW_ENG_20070814.0818.LDC2009T13	What's a country to do with a plague of crop-munching rodents?
8709	APW_ENG_20070814.0818.LDC2009T13	Spain's Castille-Leon region has such an infestation.
8710	APW_ENG_20070814.0818.LDC2009T13	Ideas abound on how to quell it: Burn them.
8711	APW_ENG_20070814.0818.LDC2009T13	Drown them.
8712	APW_ENG_20070814.0818.LDC2009T13	Squish them with a rolling pin attached to a plow.
8713	APW_ENG_20070814.0818.LDC2009T13	Then there's this high-tech solution from a government veterinarian: Zap the mouse-like voles with ultrasound, using a cross between the Pied Piper ploy and a military pincer movement to herd them together for a collective death by either water or fire.
8714	APW_ENG_20070814.0818.LDC2009T13	The government of Castille-Leon, a northern region that is one of Spain's agricultural heartlands, began burning already-harvested farmland last week to try to wipe out an invasion that has become a nightmare.
8715	APW_ENG_20070814.0818.LDC2009T13	Jose Carlos Pinero, a veterinarian with the Castille-Leon regional health department and proponent of the ultrasound idea, said Tuesday that scientists believe there may be 700 million of the pests.
8716	APW_ENG_20070814.0818.LDC2009T13	And they stink.
8717	APW_ENG_20070814.0818.LDC2009T13	"The other day I was driving along the highway and the smell was overpowering," he said from Valladolid, the regional capital.
8718	APW_ENG_20070814.0818.LDC2009T13	Grains have been devastated.
8719	APW_ENG_20070814.0818.LDC2009T13	The voles are now turning to summer crops like potatoes, grapes and beets.
8720	APW_ENG_20070814.0818.LDC2009T13	The government says it is flummoxed as to what is causing the infestation, although Pinero blames it on a mild winter -- freezing temperatures kill off many voles -- and an abundance of spring rain that led to bountiful harvests and a rodent feast.
8721	APW_ENG_20070814.0818.LDC2009T13	Everyone seems to have a different idea of what should be done.
8722	APW_ENG_20070814.0818.LDC2009T13	Pablo Villar, mayor of Villalar de los Comuneros, population 500, tied a huge iron tube to the back of a plow Tuesday.
8723	APW_ENG_20070814.0818.LDC2009T13	The idea was to uncover the voles' hideouts, then crush them with the roller.
8724	APW_ENG_20070814.0818.LDC2009T13	"The roller did not kill as many animals as we thought it would," he said in a telephone interview, adding he will try again with a heavier roller.
8725	APW_ENG_20070814.0818.LDC2009T13	"I am simply not going to allow voles to live here with me," he said.
8726	APW_ENG_20070814.0818.LDC2009T13	From cyberspace, Internet contributors offer ideas like piping exhaust fumes into vole holes, stuffing them with rags soaked with gasoline, setting up little fences outside farmland, and even electrifying them.

8730	APW_ENG_20070816.0291.LDC2009T13	Beckham's first goal with the Galaxy came in his first start since joining the Major League Soccer team on July 13.
8731	APW_ENG_20070816.0291.LDC2009T13	He had played just 37 minutes in two previous games because of a nagging left ankle injury.
8732	APW_ENG_20070816.0291.LDC2009T13	Beckham played a total of 63 minutes before heading to the bench.
8733	APW_ENG_20070816.0291.LDC2009T13	He received a yellow card in the 18th minute for fouling United's Jaime Moreno.

8751	APW_ENG_20070824.1236.LDC2009T13	Wall Street ended its calmest week in a month with a big advance Friday, rising on solid economic readings that countered the bleak sentiment that has blanketed the financial markets.
8752	APW_ENG_20070824.1236.LDC2009T13	The Dow Jones industrial average rose more than 140 points in a lightly traded session.
8753	APW_ENG_20070824.1236.LDC2009T13	Stocks started out flat but jumped following a stronger-than- expected reading on new homes sales for July.
8754	APW_ENG_20070824.1236.LDC2009T13	That report followed a reading showing orders to factories for big-ticket goods rose sharply in July.
8755	APW_ENG_20070824.1236.LDC2009T13	The stock market's gains Friday after several stable or positive sessions suggested that Federal Reserve policymakers and stock market investors have perhaps struck a truce -- maybe only a tenuous one -- with the Fed acknowledging it stands ready to try to fend off a calamitous seizing up of the credit markets and investors willing to focus on readings on the health of the economy before making decisions.
8756	APW_ENG_20070824.1236.LDC2009T13	"I think we've stabilized a bit since the Fed has lowered the discount rate," said Nicholas Raich, director of equity research at National City Private Client Group in Cleveland, referring to the Fed's decision a week ago to cut the interest it charges to lend directly to banks.

8776	APW_ENG_20070824.1236.LDC2009T13	The stock market tumult in recent weeks and jitters in the credit market had boosted expectations among some investors that the central bank would have to intervene with a cut in the fed funds rate at or even before its Sept. 18 meeting.
8777	APW_ENG_20070824.1236.LDC2009T13	The central bankers appeared determined to deploy a measured response and not necessarily give in to a Street looking for a return of easy access to cash.
8778	APW_ENG_20070824.1236.LDC2009T13	"It's really day-by-day with all this news," said Raich, referring to economic data and concerns about faltering mortgages and upheaval in the credit markets.
8779	APW_ENG_20070824.1236.LDC2009T13	He said the latest economic readings boost a sense that the Fed isn't likely to cut rates.
8780	APW_ENG_20070824.1236.LDC2009T13	"Obviously the market is adjusting to that probably not occurring.
8781	APW_ENG_20070824.1236.LDC2009T13	There were fears just a few weeks ago that the U.S. housing woes were going to impact the global environment."

8793	APW_ENG_20070829.1203.LDC2009T13	Idaho Sen. Larry Craig is not sticking to the script about how Washington sex scandals play out.
8794	APW_ENG_20070829.1203.LDC2009T13	In fact, he is following it backward.
8795	APW_ENG_20070829.1203.LDC2009T13	The rich history of powerful figures accused of misbehavior shows they tend to deny it indignantly, try to ride the storm with tortured explanations, then give in to contrition if they're cornered.
8796	APW_ENG_20070829.1203.LDC2009T13	Not Craig.
8797	APW_ENG_20070829.1203.LDC2009T13	First came an admission of guilt -- and now the defiant protestation of innocence.
8798	APW_ENG_20070829.1203.LDC2009T13	His declaration Tuesday that "I did nothing wrong" came weeks after he pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct in the men's room at the Minneapolis airport.
8799	APW_ENG_20070829.1203.LDC2009T13	He vowed to tough it out even as his party's leaders called for a Senate ethics investigation.
8800	APW_ENG_20070829.1203.LDC2009T13	Eric Dezenhall, a crisis-management consultant, has seen many follow this unwritten rule when fighting to save their career from scandal: "If you're guilty, repent

8802	APW_ENG_20070829.1203.LDC2009T13	That could prove tough in Craig's case, considering his plea.
8803	APW_ENG_20070829.1203.LDC2009T13	The Hennepin County, Minnesota, court docket said he paid $575 (euro421) in fines and fees and was put on unsupervised probation for a year.
8804	APW_ENG_20070829.1203.LDC2009T13	A 10-day sentence in the county workhouse was stayed.
8805	APW_ENG_20070829.1203.LDC2009T13	The undercover office who arrested Craig in the men's room alleged he had engaged in actions "often used by persons communicating a desire to engage in sexual conduct."
8806	APW_ENG_20070829.1203.LDC2009T13	There is no clear road map to surviving the revelation of unsavory behavior -- what works for one figure sinks another.
8807	APW_ENG_20070829.1203.LDC2009T13	Gary Hart saw his presidential ambitions dashed by his "fool mistake" of an extramarital affair while Bill Clinton overcame multiple "bimbo eruptions" to win the presidency, then survived impeachment in the Monica Lewinsky scandal to leave office with high ratings.
8808	APW_ENG_20070829.1203.LDC2009T13	Now, Capitol Hill is again looking into misconduct by one of its own, with memories still fresh of the explosive page scandal a year ago.
8809	APW_ENG_20070829.1203.LDC2009T13	That episode led to the swift resignation of Florida Republican Rep. Mark Foley, months of recrimination during the election campaign over the stewardship of young people serving as congressional pages, and a criminal investigation that continues in Florida over whether Foley tried to seduce underage boys.
8810	APW_ENG_20070829.1203.LDC2009T13	A scandal sampler:
8811	APW_ENG_20070829.1203.LDC2009T13	--President Bill Clinton gave evasive and misleading testimony under oath and publicly denied having sexual relations with "that woman," former intern Lewinsky, only to be forced into a humiliating reversal.
8812	APW_ENG_20070829.1203.LDC2009T13	He was impeached and then acquitted in a 1999 Senate trial.
8813	APW_ENG_20070829.1203.LDC2009T13	--Barack Obama, now running for the Democratic presidential nomination, found his entry into national politics eased when his Republican opponent in the 2004 Illinois Senate race, Jack Ryan, dropped out.
8814	APW_ENG_20070829.1203.LDC2009T13	Divorce papers filed by his wife alleged he had taken her to "bizarre clubs" and asked her to have sex in front of other people.

8816	APW_ENG_20070829.1203.LDC2009T13	He acknowledged only that they went to one avant-garde club in Paris where they both felt creepy.
8817	APW_ENG_20070829.1203.LDC2009T13	Obama easily defeated Ryan's late replacement, Alan Keyes, in what had been a Republican seat.
8818	APW_ENG_20070829.1203.LDC2009T13	--Rep. Bob Livingston, was on the verge of becoming Republican House speaker in 1998 when he acknowledged straying in his marriage.

8821	APW_ENG_20070829.1203.LDC2009T13	Hart, who had challenged the press to check on rumors of philandering, initially denounced the report as preposterous.
8822	APW_ENG_20070829.1203.LDC2009T13	But his liaison with Donna Rice, who had also been photographed sitting on his lap near a yacht named "Monkey Business," sank his campaign.

8824	APW_ENG_20070829.1203.LDC2009T13	--Democratic Rep. Gary Condit lost re-election in 2002 after the disappearance of Chandra Levy, a former intern with the U.S. Bureau of Prisons in Washington.
8825	APW_ENG_20070829.1203.LDC2009T13	Her remains were found in May 2002 in a Washington park, and no one has been charged in her death.

8839	APW_ENG_20070901.0069.LDC2009T13	DES MOINES, Iowa 2007-09-01 00:36:45 UTC
8840	APW_ENG_20070901.0069.LDC2009T13	A judge's decision to knock down a same-sex marriage ban in the state of Iowa stirred up the U.S. presidential race as Republicans jostled to stake out a position with the state's conservative voters in mind.
8841	APW_ENG_20070901.0069.LDC2009T13	Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney was the first to seize on the ruling, promptly aligning himself with Iowa political leaders in denouncing the decision.
8842	APW_ENG_20070901.0069.LDC2009T13	The former Massachusetts governor's swift criticism served to bolster the conservative image his campaign has been working hard to promote to Iowa's Republican voters.
8843	APW_ENG_20070901.0069.LDC2009T13	Romney stressed his support for a federal amendment that would ban same-sex marriage, a stand that distinguishes him from his top rivals, who have said they prefer to leave such decisions to the states.
8844	APW_ENG_20070901.0069.LDC2009T13	"The ruling in Iowa ... is another example of an activist court and unelected judges trying to redefine marriage and disregard the will of the people as expressed through Iowa's Defense of Marriage Act," Romney said in a statement shortly after the ruling was made.
8845	APW_ENG_20070901.0069.LDC2009T13	"This once again highlights the need for a Federal Marriage Amendment to protect the traditional definition of marriage as between one man and one woman."
8846	APW_ENG_20070901.0069.LDC2009T13	On Friday, Polk County Judge Robert Hanson, who ruled Thursday that the state's decade-old ban on same-sex marriage was unconstitutional, issued a stay on his own ruling.
8847	APW_ENG_20070901.0069.LDC2009T13	The stay closed the window for any gay couples seeking to marry in Polk County, which includes the state capital Des Moines.
8848	APW_ENG_20070901.0069.LDC2009T13	But the decision inflamed an issue that is important to the state's conservative Republican voters.
8849	APW_ENG_20070901.0069.LDC2009T13	Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton was the first Democrat to offer a reaction.
8850	APW_ENG_20070901.0069.LDC2009T13	Taping an appearance on "The Ellen DeGeneres Show" Friday, Clinton said she favors civil unions "with full equality of benefits."
8851	APW_ENG_20070901.0069.LDC2009T13	But she said the question of same-sex marriage should be left up to the states.
8852	APW_ENG_20070901.0069.LDC2009T13	"The states have always determined age of marriage, other conditions and over time we've gotten rid of a lot of discrimination that used to exist in marriage laws," she said.
8853	APW_ENG_20070901.0069.LDC2009T13	"That's now happening.
8854	APW_ENG_20070901.0069.LDC2009T13	People are making decisions.
8855	APW_ENG_20070901.0069.LDC2009T13	Civil unions, marriage.
8856	APW_ENG_20070901.0069.LDC2009T13	They're deciding in the states and I think that's the appropriate place for that to be."
8857	APW_ENG_20070901.0069.LDC2009T13	A spokesman for Democrat Barack Obama said the senator "believes these matters should be left to the states, which is why he opposes the Defense of Marriage Act."
8858	APW_ENG_20070901.0069.LDC2009T13	While most Democratic candidates have voiced support for same-sex civil unions, they have declined to back gay marriage, a stance that has created some tension with their gay supporters.
8859	APW_ENG_20070901.0069.LDC2009T13	For Republicans, the task was not to offend conservatives.
8860	APW_ENG_20070901.0069.LDC2009T13	Republican White House hopeful John McCain called the ruling "a loss for the traditional family."
8861	APW_ENG_20070901.0069.LDC2009T13	"I have always supported the traditional definition of marriage as between one man and one woman," he said.
8862	APW_ENG_20070901.0069.LDC2009T13	"The ruling of the court only reinforces my belief that we must have a president who is committed to appointing strict constructionists to the bench."
8863	APW_ENG_20070901.0069.LDC2009T13	Kansas Senator Sam Brownback, who has worked hard to gain the backing of social conservatives in Iowa, offered a sharp rejection of the judge's ruling.
8864	APW_ENG_20070901.0069.LDC2009T13	"The people of Iowa reject the redefinition of marriage, and I pledge today to defend the bond of marriage, as I have consistently done in the past," he said in a statement.
8865	APW_ENG_20070901.0069.LDC2009T13	Jarrod Agen, a spokesman for Rudy Giuliani, said the former New York mayor "believes marriage is between a man and a woman."
8866	APW_ENG_20070901.0069.LDC2009T13	Giuliani has supported limited legal recognition for same-sex couples.
8867	APW_ENG_20070901.0069.LDC2009T13	"It's becoming increasingly clear why we need judges who interpret the Constitution rather than legislate from the bench," Agen said.
8868	APW_ENG_20070901.0069.LDC2009T13	"It's the reason why Rudy is committed to appointing strict constructionist judges in the vein of Alito, Roberts and Scalia."
8869	APW_ENG_20070901.0069.LDC2009T13	Former Senator Fred Thompson, who will officially enter the presidential race next week, has offered support for a federal amendment that would prevent states without gay marriage laws from having to recognize same-sex marriages from other states.
8870	APW_ENG_20070901.0069.LDC2009T13	On Friday, Romney discussed the matter in a private conference call with Iowa House Republican Leader Christopher Rants, who has endorsed Romney, and Kris Mineau, president of the Massachusetts Family Institute, which led the campaign against legalizing gay marriages in Massachusetts.
8871	APW_ENG_20070901.0069.LDC2009T13	Romney was governor of Massachusetts in 2003 when the state's supreme court legalized same-sex marriages, making it the only U.S. state to allow gay marriages.
8872	APW_ENG_20070901.0069.LDC2009T13	Romney criticized the court decision, but was unsuccessful in efforts to push through a state constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriages.
8873	APW_ENG_20070901.0069.LDC2009T13	Later, campaigning in South Carolina, Romney said he would renew his calls to amend the Constitution to ban same-sex marriage.
8874	APW_ENG_20070901.0069.LDC2009T13	"That's essential to our future," he said.
8875	APW_ENG_20070901.0069.LDC2009T13	While Romney is willing to generally leave it to states to decide how to set up health care coverage plans, he said it should not be left to states to decide same-sex marriage issues.
8876	APW_ENG_20070901.0069.LDC2009T13	"It's a status that lasts a lifetime.
8877	APW_ENG_20070901.0069.LDC2009T13	And so, if somebody is married in one state and they move to another state, that status travels with them.
8878	APW_ENG_20070901.0069.LDC2009T13	And so, if you have gay marriage in one state, whether you want it or not, you have gay marriage in all states," Romney told reporters after speaking at a Greenville, South Carolina, restaurant.
8879	APW_ENG_20070901.0069.LDC2009T13	Dianne Bystrom, director of the Carrie Chapman Catt Center for Women and Politics at Iowa State University, said the ruling could fire up social conservatives.
8880	APW_ENG_20070901.0069.LDC2009T13	"It will probably stir up the social conservatives in the state and make the climate better in Iowa for the most socially conservative of the presidential candidates," she said.
8881	APW_ENG_20070901.0069.LDC2009T13	"That would be most of them, except (Rudy) Giuliani, I guess."
8882	APW_ENG_20070901.0069.LDC2009T13	She said Romney can use the issue to dispel any lingering doubts about his commitment to social conservative causes.
8883	APW_ENG_20070901.0069.LDC2009T13	"He's very much trying to establish himself with the social conservatives in the state, who ... eye him somewhat suspiciously as not being conservative enough because of being governor of Massachusetts, which did allow gay marriages, and he switched his position on reproductive choice," she said.
8884	APW_ENG_20070901.0069.LDC2009T13	Dennis Goldford, a political scientist at Drake University in Des Moines, said Giuliani could stress his opposition to same-sex marriage to help reassure some conservatives who find his anti- terrorism stance appealing but reject his past support for some abortion rights.
8885	APW_ENG_20070901.0069.LDC2009T13	"It gives Giuliani a chance to play," he said.

8903	APW_ENG_20070904.0665.LDC2009T13	"I don't want the end of Belgium, but I fear it will happen," says Gerard Deprez, a former Christian Democratic leader from French-speaking Wallonia.
8904	APW_ENG_20070904.0665.LDC2009T13	Elio di Rupo, the Francophone Socialist leader, says the danger of Belgium's disintegration "is greater now than it was on June 10" -- when elections triggered the protracted haggling over forming the government.
8905	APW_ENG_20070904.0665.LDC2009T13	In the June 10 ballot, Christian Democrats and Liberals won 81 of the 150 parliamentary seats and agreed to form a coalition.
8906	APW_ENG_20070904.0665.LDC2009T13	But the composition of the government has been stalled due to bickering over Flemish demands for more autonomy and the redrawing a bilingual Brussels-area voting district.
8907	APW_ENG_20070904.0665.LDC2009T13	Belgium's 6.5 million Dutch-speakers and 4 million Francophones south have enjoyed broad self-rule since the 1980s
8908	APW_ENG_20070904.0665.LDC2009T13	only Brussels is officially a bilingual region.
8909	APW_ENG_20070904.0665.LDC2009T13	Many Flemish grouse their wealthier, service-based economy subsidizes Wallonia.
8910	APW_ENG_20070904.0665.LDC2009T13	Dutch-speakers view the Francophones' dilapidated cities and 14 percent unemployment -- double their rate -- as the legacy of hardline Socialist rule
8911	APW_ENG_20070904.0665.LDC2009T13	Dutch-speakers are demanding autonomy in health care, justice and transport -- some of the last bastions of central control from Brussels.
8912	APW_ENG_20070904.0665.LDC2009T13	Many feel the next logical step would be full independence.
8913	APW_ENG_20070904.0665.LDC2009T13	"Living together in one country is impossible if year after year the minority prevents the majority to realize its most important desires," Het Laatste Nieuws, Belgium's largest daily, argued recently.
8914	APW_ENG_20070904.0665.LDC2009T13	Seeing politicians "at each other's throats" in linguistic spats makes Belgians believe divorce is possible, says Jos Geysels, a commentator said in the daily De Morgen.
8915	APW_ENG_20070904.0665.LDC2009T13	Chris Peeters, an Antwerp resident, sees widespread support for Flemish independence "because all the difficulties we have had over the last 10 years in Belgium ... are coming from the French part.
8916	APW_ENG_20070904.0665.LDC2009T13	So it would be a solution for Belgium to split apart."
8917	APW_ENG_20070904.0665.LDC2009T13	A recent VTM television network poll found 46 percent of Flemings favoring independence -- the highest level in years due to the linguistic political sniping.
8918	APW_ENG_20070904.0665.LDC2009T13	Among parties, independence is an official goal only of the far- right Flemish Interest party but its growing popularity -- it won 17 seats in the June voting -- has radicalized even mainstream Flemish parties.
8919	APW_ENG_20070904.0665.LDC2009T13	There is no comparable Francophone movement.
8920	APW_ENG_20070904.0665.LDC2009T13	The daily De Standaard recently devoted several pages to the practical details of shutting down Belgium.
8921	APW_ENG_20070904.0665.LDC2009T13	Given its healthy economy, it said, Flanders could easily join the EU but divvying up national icons such as the Royal Library or the city of Brussels would be difficult.
8922	APW_ENG_20070904.0665.LDC2009T13	The demise of Belgium would bring this country full circle.
8923	APW_ENG_20070904.0665.LDC2009T13	In 1912, Jules Destree, a Francophone Socialist, wrote King Albert I a letter saying his nation -- made independent by the Netherlands in 1830 -- was an artificial nation with no regard for reality on the ground.
8924	APW_ENG_20070904.0665.LDC2009T13	Flemings and Walloons are complete opposites, Destree argued.
8925	APW_ENG_20070904.0665.LDC2009T13	"What excites one, leaves the other stone-cold ... The Walloon belongs to the Latin civilization, the Fleming to the Germanic culture.

8929	APW_ENG_20070904.0901.LDC2009T13	CONCORD, New Hampshire 2007-09-04 15:18:59 UTC
8930	APW_ENG_20070904.0901.LDC2009T13	Republican presidential hopeful John McCain was told Tuesday by New Hampshire high school students he might be too old to lead the U.S. and too conservative to be respected.
8931	APW_ENG_20070904.0901.LDC2009T13	McCain, the Arizona senator whose presidential bid has stumbled through the summer, countered the Concord High School students with humor.
8932	APW_ENG_20070904.0901.LDC2009T13	"Thanks for the question, you little jerk," McCain joked back to one student who asked the 71-year-old about his age.
8933	APW_ENG_20070904.0901.LDC2009T13	"You're drafted."
8934	APW_ENG_20070904.0901.LDC2009T13	McCain's two-day trip to New Hampshire launches his fall campaign for the Republican nomination.
8935	APW_ENG_20070904.0901.LDC2009T13	During a morning visit with students, he explained why he was not shrinking from his support for a temporary increase of troops in Iraq and why students should pay attention.
8936	APW_ENG_20070904.0901.LDC2009T13	"If this war continues much longer, there will be people in this audience who will serve in the military, who also may be going over there (in Iraq) or to Afghanistan," McCain told the high school students.
8937	APW_ENG_20070904.0901.LDC2009T13	He said the students should watch the upcoming report on Iraq from Gen. David Petraeus.
8938	APW_ENG_20070904.0901.LDC2009T13	"It may be a seminal debate.
8939	APW_ENG_20070904.0901.LDC2009T13	It may be one of the most important debates in history and it may directly affect your lives," he warned.
8940	APW_ENG_20070904.0901.LDC2009T13	"He's going to say: Whether it was or was not in the beginning, if we lose Iraq, it will be part of this struggle against radical, Islamic extremism because al-Qaida will take over and the area will deteriorate into chaos and destruction."
8941	APW_ENG_20070904.0901.LDC2009T13	But during a town hall-style meeting, students were more interested in pushing McCain on the environment, his support for gay rights and even his age.
8942	APW_ENG_20070904.0901.LDC2009T13	"If elected, you'd be older than Ronald Reagan, making you the oldest president.
8943	APW_ENG_20070904.0901.LDC2009T13	Do you ever worry you might die in office or get Alzheimer's or some other disease that might affect your judgment?"
8944	APW_ENG_20070904.0901.LDC2009T13	one student asked.
8945	APW_ENG_20070904.0901.LDC2009T13	The audience groaned
8946	APW_ENG_20070904.0901.LDC2009T13	McCain slid into a joke.
8947	APW_ENG_20070904.0901.LDC2009T13	"I think it was one of my sons that alleged I'm getting to the point I hide my own Easter eggs," McCain said to laughter.
8948	APW_ENG_20070904.0901.LDC2009T13	"When you saw my 95-year-old mother (on a video introduction), you saw the kind of genes I have."
8949	APW_ENG_20070904.0901.LDC2009T13	He said he is a hard campaigner and his age will not be an issue.
8950	APW_ENG_20070904.0901.LDC2009T13	Another student pushed him on gay rights
8951	APW_ENG_20070904.0901.LDC2009T13	McCain repeated his pledge to oppose discrimination but support for traditional marriage.
8952	APW_ENG_20070904.0901.LDC2009T13	"I came here looking to see a good leader," 16-year-old William Sleaster told McCain to boos.
8953	APW_ENG_20070904.0901.LDC2009T13	"I don't."

8955	APW_ENG_20070907.1290.LDC2009T13	A: MTV president describes the ' total reinvention ' of the Video Music Awards
8956	APW_ENG_20070907.1290.LDC2009T13	NEW YORK 2007-09-07 18:41:03 UTC
8957	APW_ENG_20070907.1290.LDC2009T13	"New and Improved" is a tried-and-true corporate cliche.
8958	APW_ENG_20070907.1290.LDC2009T13	If Sunday's MTV Video Music Awards are a success, perhaps "Complete and Total Reinvention" will become the new buzz packaging.
8959	APW_ENG_20070907.1290.LDC2009T13	In recent years, what once was the most entertaining awards show on TV has become a victim of its own excess, failing to match such immortal moments as Britney tongue-kissing Madonna or Eminem assaulting an insulting puppet.
8960	APW_ENG_20070907.1290.LDC2009T13	To bounce back, MTV (which is owned by Viacom Inc.) upended its longtime format in a variety of ways, including moving the show to a Las Vegas hotel and moving some performers to "fantasy suites" where they will jam for their hand-picked entourages.
8961	APW_ENG_20070907.1290.LDC2009T13	MTV President Christian Norman spoke with The Associated Press about recreating the anti-awards show.
8962	APW_ENG_20070907.1290.LDC2009T13	AP: So why should people tune in this year?
8963	APW_ENG_20070907.1290.LDC2009T13	Norman: To see the complete and total reinvention of the VMAs.
8964	APW_ENG_20070907.1290.LDC2009T13	Last year's show had all the great music stars, but didn't connect with the audience in the way they wanted it to.
8965	APW_ENG_20070907.1290.LDC2009T13	They wanted us to mix it up.
8966	APW_ENG_20070907.1290.LDC2009T13	If you think about when the show first started, no one did what we were doing.
8967	APW_ENG_20070907.1290.LDC2009T13	Now a lot of other people were able to adapt.
8968	APW_ENG_20070907.1290.LDC2009T13	AP: Is it harder to create a compelling show when viewers can see these artists anytime they want on demand?
8969	APW_ENG_20070907.1290.LDC2009T13	Norman: Live is what they love the most.
8970	APW_ENG_20070907.1290.LDC2009T13	They want to see what the band hasn't done everywhere else.
8971	APW_ENG_20070907.1290.LDC2009T13	These fantasy suites fit perfectly.
8972	APW_ENG_20070907.1290.LDC2009T13	You've seen these artists before, but never like this.
8973	APW_ENG_20070907.1290.LDC2009T13	If artists just want to come on stage and do their single, this is not the show for that.
8974	APW_ENG_20070907.1290.LDC2009T13	AP: Last year you had live backstage feeds on your Web site.
8975	APW_ENG_20070907.1290.LDC2009T13	Why aren't you doing that again?
8976	APW_ENG_20070907.1290.LDC2009T13	Norman: This year we're driving them online to have a different experience.
8977	APW_ENG_20070907.1290.LDC2009T13	The show is live that one night only.
8978	APW_ENG_20070907.1290.LDC2009T13	There are no reruns.
8979	APW_ENG_20070907.1290.LDC2009T13	If you don't watch it on Sept. 9, you won't see it.
8980	APW_ENG_20070907.1290.LDC2009T13	The repeats will be three different remixes.
8981	APW_ENG_20070907.1290.LDC2009T13	One is the artist commentary version, the second is an all-music version with tons of footage from the fantasy suites, and the last version is the audience viewers' choice.
8982	APW_ENG_20070907.1290.LDC2009T13	We want people to go to mtv.com, look at everything and rate the segments.
8983	APW_ENG_20070907.1290.LDC2009T13	AP: How do you define success for this show?
8984	APW_ENG_20070907.1290.LDC2009T13	Just viewers, or something else?
8985	APW_ENG_20070907.1290.LDC2009T13	Norman: Obviously we'd like having a huge audience watch and go online and interact with the show, and having great success for our partners (who offer video on demand and streaming to wireless customers).
8986	APW_ENG_20070907.1290.LDC2009T13	The show takes place in different forms everywhere.
8987	APW_ENG_20070907.1290.LDC2009T13	To have those touchpoints work with the audience determines the success for me.
8988	APW_ENG_20070907.1290.LDC2009T13	AP: Why do you think last year's show was called dull?
8989	APW_ENG_20070907.1290.LDC2009T13	Norman: I wouldn't say anything went wrong.
8990	APW_ENG_20070907.1290.LDC2009T13	It needed a complete and total change.
8991	APW_ENG_20070907.1290.LDC2009T13	That's the thing about MTV -- music is always evolving and we should evolve with it.
8992	APW_ENG_20070907.1290.LDC2009T13	We didn't take the cues to evolve the show.
8993	APW_ENG_20070907.1290.LDC2009T13	Producing the same show now as you do in '99 is ridiculous.
8994	APW_ENG_20070907.1290.LDC2009T13	AP: After all the incredible things that have happened on the show, can you be a success without that `eureka' moment?
8995	APW_ENG_20070907.1290.LDC2009T13	Norman: It's great that people have fond memories, it gives us a lot to aspire to.
8996	APW_ENG_20070907.1290.LDC2009T13	It's a lot to live up to, but we are poised to deliver.
8997	APW_ENG_20070907.1290.LDC2009T13	AP: It sounds like there's a lot of alcohol available for the talent this year, kind of like a Golden Globes setup.
8998	APW_ENG_20070907.1290.LDC2009T13	Norman: We've always had a green room and hospitality.
8999	APW_ENG_20070907.1290.LDC2009T13	In Vegas we're doing tables for the audience as opposed to rows

9010	APW_ENG_20070908.0627.LDC2009T13	Bishop Filaret, known for his support of Serbian ultra- nationalists, and who was once photographed holding a machine gun, started refusing food 10 days ago at a border crossing to protest a ban on his entry into Montenegro.
9011	APW_ENG_20070908.0627.LDC2009T13	He was taken to a hospital overnight Friday with his health deteriorating, RTS TV said, adding that his life was not in danger.
9012	APW_ENG_20070908.0627.LDC2009T13	Montenegrin authorities said the priest was banned because he was listed by the U.N. war crimes court for the former Yugoslavia as an alleged helper of fugitives sought by the court -- including former Bosnian Serb military commander Ratko Mladic and wartime leader Radovan Karadzic -- and is subject to an EU travel ban.

9035	APW_ENG_20070913.0218.LDC2009T13	On the tapes, Saddam is heard praising former Gov. John Connally and the Texas oilman, Oscar S. Wyatt Jr., saying through an interpreter: "We cannot forget friends ... and we should recall your position always."
9036	APW_ENG_20070913.0218.LDC2009T13	Prosecutors say Wyatt, of Houston, cashed in on the friendship, garnering lucrative oil contracts from the corrupt United Nations oil-for-food program by paying millions of dollars in kickbacks to Iraqi officials.
9037	APW_ENG_20070913.0218.LDC2009T13	The program, which ran from 1996 to 2003, was created to help Iraqis cope with U.N. sanctions imposed after Saddam's 1990 invasion of Kuwait and let the Iraqi government sell oil primarily to buy humanitarian goods.
9038	APW_ENG_20070913.0218.LDC2009T13	If convicted, Wyatt, 83, could face more than 60 years in prison.
9039	APW_ENG_20070913.0218.LDC2009T13	His defense lawyers say Wyatt was a hero who persuaded Saddam to agree at the 1990 meeting to begin releasing dozens of Americans he had ordered held as potential shields in the event the United States decided to invade his country.
9040	APW_ENG_20070913.0218.LDC2009T13	A portion of the tape was played on the same day that the government called to the witness stand one of its star witnesses, Samir Vincent, who has pleaded guilty to being an unregistered agent for Iraq.
9041	APW_ENG_20070913.0218.LDC2009T13	Vincent testified that he met Wyatt for the first time on the day the oilman and Connally met Saddam.
9042	APW_ENG_20070913.0218.LDC2009T13	He said he accompanied Wyatt on as many as eight trips between 1991 and 1997, helping to communicate with top officials in Iraq.
9043	APW_ENG_20070913.0218.LDC2009T13	He said Iraqi officials liked Wyatt so much that they wanted to reserve an oil field south of Baghdad for him in the event that sanctions against the country were lifted.
9044	APW_ENG_20070913.0218.LDC2009T13	"They thought Oscar Wyatt deserved to have this field because of his long relationship with Iraq," Vincent testified.
9045	APW_ENG_20070913.0218.LDC2009T13	The oil field could have produced as many as 300,000 barrels of oil a day, he said.
9046	APW_ENG_20070913.0218.LDC2009T13	In the transcript of the 1990 meeting, Connally told Saddam that they had met with him as private citizens, "speaking only for ourselves."
9047	APW_ENG_20070913.0218.LDC2009T13	He said, "We are very certain that President Bush will be very displeased that we are here at all."
9048	APW_ENG_20070913.0218.LDC2009T13	Connally called Bush's views toward Iraq "hard line" and said they did not understand why he had taken such a hard line toward Iraq after it invaded Kuwait.
9049	APW_ENG_20070913.0218.LDC2009T13	"Mr. President, it is our view that the American people are not going to be happy to go to war over oil," Connally said.
9050	APW_ENG_20070913.0218.LDC2009T13	Wyatt could be heard telling Saddam that he had visited Iraq as many as 40 times in the previous 15 years as a businessman and that he was "largely responsible" for a lot of the transactions in which Iraqis sold one-third of their oil exports to the United States.
9051	APW_ENG_20070913.0218.LDC2009T13	Saddam told him that Baghdad, until 1972, was a large derelict village.
9052	APW_ENG_20070913.0218.LDC2009T13	"And now everything that you see outstanding here was built by us," he said.
9053	APW_ENG_20070913.0218.LDC2009T13	The late Iraqi leader said he was "confident that the people of the United States, too, are keen to have peace."
9054	APW_ENG_20070913.0218.LDC2009T13	Connally said the freeing of the hostages would take from the U.S. government "one important single emotional issue that they have competing for the American people for support against you and your position."

9056	APW_ENG_20070913.0957.LDC2009T13	CARDIFF, Wales 2007-09-13 15:00:34 UTC
9057	APW_ENG_20070913.0957.LDC2009T13	Stephen Jones swung the opening match in Wales' favor and the selection balance in favor of experience for Saturday's crucial World Cup Group B encounter against Australia.
9058	APW_ENG_20070913.0957.LDC2009T13	Wales coach Gareth Jenkins recalled three veterans with more than 250 caps between them on Thursday for the Millennium Stadium clash against the two-time champion Australians.
9059	APW_ENG_20070913.0957.LDC2009T13	The 29-year-old Jones replaced 22-year-old James Hook at flyhalf in the most hotly contested position, with veteran backrower Colin Charvis winning a recall and Gareth Thomas returning at fullback and captain.
9060	APW_ENG_20070913.0957.LDC2009T13	The trio, with a combined 251 test caps, all came off the bench in the 42-17 win over Canada.
9061	APW_ENG_20070913.0957.LDC2009T13	Jones was crucial in sparking the attack which crossed for five unanswered tries after Wales slipped behind 17-9 in the second half.
9062	APW_ENG_20070913.0957.LDC2009T13	Adam Jones was also included at prop to add some weight to the scrum, where the Welsh hope to dominate the Wallabies.
9063	APW_ENG_20070913.0957.LDC2009T13	With the winner in Cardiff expected to top the group, and avoid an expected quarterfinal against South Africa, Jenkins did not want to gamble.
9064	APW_ENG_20070913.0957.LDC2009T13	"We have brought in three players who showed last weekend what experienced heads can do to a performance," he said.
9065	APW_ENG_20070913.0957.LDC2009T13	"They picked up the game against Canada and were able to fashion a victory for us.
9066	APW_ENG_20070913.0957.LDC2009T13	"Our team is evolving at the right time and we are very much looking forward to the challenge this weekend."
9067	APW_ENG_20070913.0957.LDC2009T13	Jenkins has never overseen such an important match.
9068	APW_ENG_20070913.0957.LDC2009T13	He said recent results, including Wales' two losses in Australia earlier this year and its win and draw against the Wallabies in the last two matches at Cardiff were of no consequence to the upcoming clash.
9069	APW_ENG_20070913.0957.LDC2009T13	"This is a significant match for us in many ways.
9070	APW_ENG_20070913.0957.LDC2009T13	It's the most important match a Welsh side has played for a long time," Jenkins said.
9071	APW_ENG_20070913.0957.LDC2009T13	"We have gone through practically every emotion possible in our last four meetings with them.
9072	APW_ENG_20070913.0957.LDC2009T13	"But World Cup rugby pays no respect to history or to emotion.
9073	APW_ENG_20070913.0957.LDC2009T13	We have a considered and professional approach and we have selected a team to win this test match."

9081	APW_ENG_20070915.0324.LDC2009T13	BRATISLAVA, Slovakia 2007-09-15 11:58:43 UTC
9082	APW_ENG_20070915.0324.LDC2009T13	Slovak doctors have successfully separated twins joined at the chest in what was the second operation of this kind in the country, an official said Saturday.
9083	APW_ENG_20070915.0324.LDC2009T13	The 5-month-old twin boys were separated during almost a 20-hour operation that was successfully concluded Saturday, said Daniel Zitnan, the head of Bratislava's Children University Hospital.
9084	APW_ENG_20070915.0324.LDC2009T13	Zitnan said that the two, named Marek and Misko, were in stable condition but it was too soon to say what their chances for recovery recover were.
9085	APW_ENG_20070915.0324.LDC2009T13	He said the most difficult task for the doctors was to separate the liver and the gall bladder that the baby boys shared.
9086	APW_ENG_20070915.0324.LDC2009T13	The operation was necessary for their survival, Zitnan said.
9087	APW_ENG_20070915.0324.LDC2009T13	"I do thank the doctors and nurses from my heart," the boys' mother, Marianna Muellerova, was quoted as saying on Sme daily's Web site Saturday.
9088	APW_ENG_20070915.0324.LDC2009T13	"I have an enormous admiration for them."
9089	APW_ENG_20070915.0324.LDC2009T13	Zitnan said it was the second surgery of this kind in Slovakia.

9092	APW_ENG_20070918.0711.LDC2009T13	TIRANA, Albania 2007-09-18 12:53:13 UTC
9093	APW_ENG_20070918.0711.LDC2009T13	A junior minister, six other senior officials of the Transport Ministry and two owners of private companies have been arrested on accusations of corruption and abuse of office, the Interior Ministry said Tuesday.
9094	APW_ENG_20070918.0711.LDC2009T13	Deputy minister Nikolin Jaka and the others were arrested late Monday for illegally favoring private companies in tender projects.
9095	APW_ENG_20070918.0711.LDC2009T13	The offenses carry sentences of up to 10 years in prison.
9096	APW_ENG_20070918.0711.LDC2009T13	Genti Strazimiri, the deputy interior minister, said that in a two-month investigation police had collected proof of corruption amounting to millions of dollars in relation to road tender projects planned for the second half of this year.
9097	APW_ENG_20070918.0711.LDC2009T13	Three other officials of the same ministry, including a former deputy minister, have recently been charged with abuse of office for another road project.

9101	APW_ENG_20070924.0079.LDC2009T13	DETROIT 2007-09-24 01:02:10 UTC
9102	APW_ENG_20070924.0079.LDC2009T13	Negotiators for General Motors Corp. and the United Auto Workers were close to finalizing the details of a new contract after 20 straight days of talks, according to a local union official who is being briefed on the discussions.
9103	APW_ENG_20070924.0079.LDC2009T13	The two sides have wrapped up work on most issues and on Sunday were down to determining how much money GM must put into a trust fund for retiree health care that will be managed by the UAW, said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the talks are private.
9104	APW_ENG_20070924.0079.LDC2009T13	"My sense is they are close.
9105	APW_ENG_20070924.0079.LDC2009T13	I think this is the end game," said Harley Shaiken, a professor at the University of California at Berkeley who specializes in labor issues and has been closely following the talks.
9106	APW_ENG_20070924.0079.LDC2009T13	"They may be approaching a resolution, but if that's in the next two hours or the next two days, it's hard to say.
9107	APW_ENG_20070924.0079.LDC2009T13	There are a lot of complex issues yet to be resolved."
9108	APW_ENG_20070924.0079.LDC2009T13	The health care fund -- known as a Voluntary Employees Beneficiary Association, or VEBA -- would be a groundbreaking change for the auto industry and has been the major issue in this year's negotiations.
9109	APW_ENG_20070924.0079.LDC2009T13	GM has around $51 billion (euro36.3 billion) in unfunded retiree health care costs, but the company is not required to put the full amount into the VEBA.
9110	APW_ENG_20070924.0079.LDC2009T13	The UAW and GM have been wrangling over how much GM should put in and how much can be paid in cash or in stock.
9111	APW_ENG_20070924.0079.LDC2009T13	Talks resumed Sunday morning after negotiators recessed Saturday evening, GM spokesman Tom Wickham said.
9112	APW_ENG_20070924.0079.LDC2009T13	Sunday marked the ninth day since GM's contract with the UAW had been scheduled to expire.
9113	APW_ENG_20070924.0079.LDC2009T13	The contract has been renewed on an hour-by-hour basis since then.
9114	APW_ENG_20070924.0079.LDC2009T13	A message seeking comment was left for UAW spokesman Roger Kerson.
9115	APW_ENG_20070924.0079.LDC2009T13	Several local union officials said they had heard little about the negotiations as of Sunday afternoon and had not been told when the UAW will tell them about the deal.
9116	APW_ENG_20070924.0079.LDC2009T13	Once a tentative agreement is reached, local union leaders will meet for a briefing and then will present the deal to their members.
9117	APW_ENG_20070924.0079.LDC2009T13	Any agreement will have to be ratified by a majority of GM's 73,000 UAW members.
9118	APW_ENG_20070924.0079.LDC2009T13	Among the Detroit Three, the UAW picked GM as the lead company in negotiations and the union's potential strike target, so Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler LLC would likely match many of the terms of GM's agreement.
9119	APW_ENG_20070924.0079.LDC2009T13	GM, which has about 339,000 UAW retirees and spouses, badly wants to pay the union to form the VEBA to get the health care liabilities off its books.
9120	APW_ENG_20070924.0079.LDC2009T13	The UAW is seeking guarantees of new vehicles to be built in U.S. plants in exchange.
9121	APW_ENG_20070924.0079.LDC2009T13	Shaiken said workers will want to see job security promises if they're being asked to accept a VEBA.
9122	APW_ENG_20070924.0079.LDC2009T13	"There's a tendency in negotiations for observers to focus on one or two contentious issues, but ultimately it's a package that's being voted on," he said.

9125	APW_ENG_20070929.0593.LDC2009T13	A homemade bomb exploded Saturday outside a crowded city park in the Maldives, wounding at least 12 people, all of them foreign tourists, a government official said.
9126	APW_ENG_20070929.0593.LDC2009T13	Officials in the Indian Ocean archipelago, renowned for its exclusive tourist resorts, said they did not know who was behind the attack that hit the crowded Sultan Park in the capital, Male, about 3 p.m.
9127	APW_ENG_20070929.0593.LDC2009T13	"The Maldives has never had something like this before.
9128	APW_ENG_20070929.0593.LDC2009T13	We are taking this very seriously because tourism is our life blood," government spokesman Mohamed Shareef said.
9129	APW_ENG_20070929.0593.LDC2009T13	The injured included two Britons, eight Chinese and two Japanese, all of whom suffered burn injuries, Shareef said.
9130	APW_ENG_20070929.0593.LDC2009T13	Maldives police did not immediately know how the bomb was detonated or where it was planted, Shareef said.
9131	APW_ENG_20070929.0593.LDC2009T13	He said it was too early to say whether the bomb targeted the tourism industry and the possible involvement of an Islamic Jihadist outfit, adding that all possibilities would be investigated.
9132	APW_ENG_20070929.0593.LDC2009T13	"They (the tourists) are still in a state of shock, and police have still not interviewed them," Shareef said.
9133	APW_ENG_20070929.0593.LDC2009T13	Authorities will seek help from Interpol, the United States and India in investigating the blast, Shareef said.
9134	APW_ENG_20070929.0593.LDC2009T13	The opposition Minivan News reported on its Web site that witnesses said they saw nails, presumably from the bomb, scattered in the park, which is located near the country's army headquarters.

9160	APW_ENG_20071003.0324.LDC2009T13	Separated by hundreds of miles (kilometers) and divergent political philosophies, the Middlebury Institute and the League of the South are hosting a two-day Secessionist Convention starting Wednesday in Chattanooga.
9161	APW_ENG_20071003.0324.LDC2009T13	They expect to attract supporters from California, Alaska and Hawaii, inviting anyone who wants to dissolve the union so states can save themselves from an overbearing federal government.
9162	APW_ENG_20071003.0324.LDC2009T13	If allowed to go their own way, New Englanders "probably would allow abortion and have gun control," Hill said, while Southerners "would probably crack down on illegal immigration harder than it is being now."
9163	APW_ENG_20071003.0324.LDC2009T13	The U.S. Constitution does not explicitly prohibit secession, but few people think it is politically viable.
9164	APW_ENG_20071003.0324.LDC2009T13	Vermont, one of the nation's most liberal states, has become a hotbed for liberal secessionists, a fringe movement that gained new traction because of the Iraq war, rising oil prices and the formation of several pro-secession groups.
9165	APW_ENG_20071003.0324.LDC2009T13	Thomas Naylor, the founder of one of those groups, the Second Vermont Republic, said the friendly relationship with the League of the South did not mean everyone shares all the same beliefs.
9166	APW_ENG_20071003.0324.LDC2009T13	But Naylor, a retired Duke University professor, said the League of the South shares his group's opposition to the federal government and the need to pursue secession.
9167	APW_ENG_20071003.0324.LDC2009T13	"It doesn't matter if our next president is Condoleezza (Rice) or Hillary (Clinton), it is going to be grim," said Naylor, adding that there are secessionist movements in more than 25 states, including Hawaii, Alaska, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Texas.
9168	APW_ENG_20071003.0324.LDC2009T13	The Middlebury Institute, based in Cold Spring, New York, was started in 2005.
9169	APW_ENG_20071003.0324.LDC2009T13	Its followers, disillusioned by the Iraq war and federal imperialism, share the idea of states becoming independent republics.
9170	APW_ENG_20071003.0324.LDC2009T13	They contend their movement is growing.
9171	APW_ENG_20071003.0324.LDC2009T13	The first North American Separatist Convention was held last fall in Vermont, which, unlike most Southern states, supports civil unions.
9172	APW_ENG_20071003.0324.LDC2009T13	Voters there elected a socialist to the U.S. Senate.
9173	APW_ENG_20071003.0324.LDC2009T13	Middlebury director Kirpatrick Sale said Hill offered to sponsor the second secessionist convention, but the co-sponsor arrangement was intended to show that "the folks up north regard you as legitimate colleagues."
9174	APW_ENG_20071003.0324.LDC2009T13	"It bothers me that people have wrongly declared them to be racists," Sale said.
9175	APW_ENG_20071003.0324.LDC2009T13	The League of the South says it is not racist, but proudly displays a Confederate Battle Flag on its banner.
9176	APW_ENG_20071003.0324.LDC2009T13	Mark Potok, director of the Southern Poverty Law Center's Intelligence Project, which monitors hate groups, said the League of the South "has been on our list close to a decade."
9177	APW_ENG_20071003.0324.LDC2009T13	"What is remarkable and really astounding about this situation is we see people and institutions who are supposedly on the progressive left rubbing shoulders with bona fide white supremacists," Potok said.
9178	APW_ENG_20071003.0324.LDC2009T13	Sale said the League of the South "has not done or said anything racist in its 14 years of existence," and that the Southern Poverty Law Center is not credible.
9179	APW_ENG_20071003.0324.LDC2009T13	"They call everybody racists," Sale said.
9180	APW_ENG_20071003.0324.LDC2009T13	"There are, no doubt, racists in the League of the South, and there are, no doubt, racists everywhere."
9181	APW_ENG_20071003.0324.LDC2009T13	Harry Watson, director of the Center For the Study of the American South and a history professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, said it was a surprise to see The Middlebury Institute conferring with the League of the South, "an organization that's associated with a cause that many of us associate with the preservation of slavery."
9182	APW_ENG_20071003.0324.LDC2009T13	He said the unlikely partnering "represents the far left and far right of American politics coming together."

9190	APW_ENG_20071009.0377.LDC2009T13	BRUSSELS, Belgium 2007-10-09 08:43:01 UTC
9191	APW_ENG_20071009.0377.LDC2009T13	Coalition talks to form a new Belgian government made their first palpable progress in four months on Tuesday when Christian Democrats and Liberals agreed on a tougher asylum policy and limited economic migration.
9192	APW_ENG_20071009.0377.LDC2009T13	The agreement came 120 days after general elections and the continued stalemate between the Dutch-speaking and Francophone negotiators had raised fears that the bilingual country was about to break up.
9193	APW_ENG_20071009.0377.LDC2009T13	Despite the partial breakthrough, all the key issues on how to grant more autonomy to Dutch-speaking Flanders, Francophone Wallonia and bilingual Brussels while maintaining a sense of unity remained on the table.
9194	APW_ENG_20071009.0377.LDC2009T13	"Overall, I am extremely pleased with the result," said Jo Vandeurzen, the head of the Flemish Christian Democrats, whose party will likely provide the next prime minister.
9195	APW_ENG_20071009.0377.LDC2009T13	Under the provisional deal which will only come into effect if the parties form a government, non-EU citizens will be able to come to Belgium to fill jobs when there are not enough EU candidates.
9196	APW_ENG_20071009.0377.LDC2009T13	The negotiators also said the asylum and possible eviction processes must be speeded up and they toughened rules on non-EU citizens bringing their families to Belgium.
9197	APW_ENG_20071009.0377.LDC2009T13	The June 10 elections left the country's political parties in a deadlock.
9198	APW_ENG_20071009.0377.LDC2009T13	The Christian Democrats and Liberals, each split into Dutch and French-speaking parties, won a majority of the 150 legislative seats.
9199	APW_ENG_20071009.0377.LDC2009T13	But they fell short of the two-thirds majority needed for constitutional reform granting Flanders and Wallonia more powers.
9200	APW_ENG_20071009.0377.LDC2009T13	Since those elections they have bickered on how to push through more autonomy, with the Flemish parties seeking more powers to govern their own affairs and their Francophone counterparts trying to hold on to as much nationwide solidarity as possible.
9201	APW_ENG_20071009.0377.LDC2009T13	The country is divided between Dutch-speaking Flanders in the north and Francophone Wallonia in the south.
9202	APW_ENG_20071009.0377.LDC2009T13	In the middle lies the capital, Brussels, which is officially bilingual.
9203	APW_ENG_20071009.0377.LDC2009T13	About 6.5 million Belgians speak Dutch, compared with 4 million Francophones.
9204	APW_ENG_20071009.0377.LDC2009T13	Yves Leterme, head of the Dutch-speaking Christian Democrats, is trying to form a government after he won the election on a platform which called for more regional autonomy.
9205	APW_ENG_20071009.0377.LDC2009T13	His is in the midst of his second attempt after the first bid failed after five weeks of fruitless talks.
9206	APW_ENG_20071009.0377.LDC2009T13	Francophones say enough powers have been shifted to Flanders and Wallonia in the last 25 years.
9207	APW_ENG_20071009.0377.LDC2009T13	They accuse Flemish politicians of engineering the demise of Belgium as a unified state.

9277	APW_ENG_20071024.0388.LDC2009T13	MANILA, Philippines 2007-10-24 09:06:03 UTC
9278	APW_ENG_20071024.0388.LDC2009T13	The mothers of two missing student activists filed a petition Wednesday urging the Philippine Supreme Court to compel the military to release the women, claiming soldiers had abducted them more than a year ago.
9279	APW_ENG_20071024.0388.LDC2009T13	The mothers of Sherlyn Cadapan and Karen Empeno, who disappeared last June northwest of Manila, invoked the court's new "writ of amparo" rule, which allows judges to order authorities to find missing persons as part of efforts to protect civil liberties amid a spate of extrajudicial killings blamed on soldiers.
9280	APW_ENG_20071024.0388.LDC2009T13	The mothers asked for the release of their daughters and a farmer, Manuel Merino, from military custody if they are still alive, or for the military to disclose the location of their graves.
9281	APW_ENG_20071024.0388.LDC2009T13	They also want to be allowed to inspect military detention areas to look for their daughters.
9282	APW_ENG_20071024.0388.LDC2009T13	They named President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, military chief Gen. Hermogenes Esperon, national police chief Avelino Razon, two retired generals and two colonels among the respondents.
9283	APW_ENG_20071024.0388.LDC2009T13	Military officials earlier denied they were holding the students.
9284	APW_ENG_20071024.0388.LDC2009T13	The mothers claim their daughters were taken by soldiers from a house in Hagonoy township, 40 kilometers (25 miles) northwest of Manila, on June 26, 2006.

9286	APW_ENG_20071024.0388.LDC2009T13	The petitioners cited new evidence, including an account by Adoracion Paulino, Capadan's mother-in-law, who said Cadapan was escorted by soldiers to her house on April 11, 2007.
9287	APW_ENG_20071024.0388.LDC2009T13	Cadapan took some clothes and left without speaking because she was being tightly guarded, Paulino said.
9288	APW_ENG_20071024.0388.LDC2009T13	The petition also cited the testimony of brothers Raymund and Reynaldo Manalo, who said they escaped military detention and sought protection from the Supreme Court.
9289	APW_ENG_20071024.0388.LDC2009T13	The two men said they were with Cadapan, Empeno and Merino in a military camp in Bataan, northwest of Manila, where they said Merino was killed.

9304	APW_ENG_20071030.1383.LDC2009T13	RAMALLAH, West Bank 2007-10-30 20:39:27 UTC
9305	APW_ENG_20071030.1383.LDC2009T13	The chief Palestinian peace negotiator raised the stakes for a U.S.-sponsored peace conference on Tuesday, saying there will be no talks with Israel unless it agrees to set a deadline for establishing a Palestinian state.
9306	APW_ENG_20071030.1383.LDC2009T13	Ahmed Qureia's ultimatum is the latest problem to beset already troubled plans for the conference.
9307	APW_ENG_20071030.1383.LDC2009T13	Arab nations have been slow to endorse the effort, and Israel is making only general promises instead of specific proposals.
9308	APW_ENG_20071030.1383.LDC2009T13	However, it was unclear if the Palestinians could afford to follow through with their ultimatum, boycotting a conference called by U.S. President George W. Bush at a time when moderate President Mahmoud Abbas needs Western support and U.S. aid in his struggle against the Islamic Hamas, which expelled his loyalists and took over Gaza in June.
9309	APW_ENG_20071030.1383.LDC2009T13	Instead, the threat could be a ploy to wring concessions from Israel.
9310	APW_ENG_20071030.1383.LDC2009T13	In violence late Tuesday, Israeli aircraft hit a Hamas police station in the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis, killing four people in uniform, hospital and Hamas officials said.
9311	APW_ENG_20071030.1383.LDC2009T13	The Israeli military said it targeted a Hamas position after the Islamic group pelted southern Israel with mortar shells earlier in the day.
9312	APW_ENG_20071030.1383.LDC2009T13	Israel and the Palestinians differ over the issue of a timetable for setting up a Palestinian state, and talks between Abbas and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert have so far failed to solve the impasse.
9313	APW_ENG_20071030.1383.LDC2009T13	On Tuesday, lead Palestinian negotiator Ahmed Qureia tightened the screws.
9314	APW_ENG_20071030.1383.LDC2009T13	"The Israeli prime minister has stated that he will not accept a timetable, and we say we will not accept negotiations without a timetable," Qureia said at a news conference with the European Union's external affairs commissioner, Benita Ferrero-Waldner.
9315	APW_ENG_20071030.1383.LDC2009T13	Qureia indicated the talks with Israel weren't going well.
9316	APW_ENG_20071030.1383.LDC2009T13	"We haven't gotten closer yet concerning the issues," he said.
9317	APW_ENG_20071030.1383.LDC2009T13	"We are talking in general about the issues that should be included in the document.
9318	APW_ENG_20071030.1383.LDC2009T13	(But) we haven't yet touched the core issues."
9319	APW_ENG_20071030.1383.LDC2009T13	What the Palestinians want, he said, is "a clear and specific document, without vagueness,, that lays the basic foundation for all final status issues.
9320	APW_ENG_20071030.1383.LDC2009T13	Without that, the conference will be hindered."
9321	APW_ENG_20071030.1383.LDC2009T13	Israeli government spokeswoman Miri Eisin said negotiations should be held behind closed doors, not through the media.
9322	APW_ENG_20071030.1383.LDC2009T13	"We're not at the ultimatum stage," Eisin said.
9323	APW_ENG_20071030.1383.LDC2009T13	"They agreed to work to go forward, and we are committed to going forward to a joint statement."
9324	APW_ENG_20071030.1383.LDC2009T13	No date has so far been set for the peace conference in Annapolis, Maryland, because the two sides remain so far apart on the starting point.
9325	APW_ENG_20071030.1383.LDC2009T13	Israel wants a vague joint statement of objectives, but the Palestinians want a detailed outline that would address core issues.
9326	APW_ENG_20071030.1383.LDC2009T13	These include final borders, sovereignty over disputed Jerusalem and a solution for Palestinians who fled or were expelled from their homes in the war that followed Israel's creation in 1948.
9327	APW_ENG_20071030.1383.LDC2009T13	In the past, deadlines for establishing a Palestinian state have been set and ignored.
9328	APW_ENG_20071030.1383.LDC2009T13	The latest was the "road map" plan of 2003, a three-stage process ending in creation of a Palestinian state in 2005.
9329	APW_ENG_20071030.1383.LDC2009T13	The plan stalled at the first stage.
9330	APW_ENG_20071030.1383.LDC2009T13	Qureia said a U.S. envoy, Lt. Gen. Keith Dayton, is meeting with both sides to try to revive the "road map."

9333	APW_ENG_20071030.1383.LDC2009T13	"We have told the Israelis that they are wrong in adopting these measures, which we fully reject," Abbas said after meeting with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in Cairo.

9335	APW_ENG_20071030.1383.LDC2009T13	British Foreign Secretary David Miliband criticized the Israeli measures Tuesday.
9336	APW_ENG_20071030.1383.LDC2009T13	In a statement, he condemned the rocket fire but said Israeli reprisals must "not cause suffering to innocent civilians."
9337	APW_ENG_20071030.1383.LDC2009T13	Palestinians in Gaza rely on Israel for all of their fuel and more than half of their electricity.

9341	APW_ENG_20071031.1490.LDC2009T13	DETROIT 2007-10-31 21:10:11 UTC
9342	APW_ENG_20071031.1490.LDC2009T13	A jury on Wednesday acquitted a former federal prosecutor of charges that he conspired to hide evidence in America's first major terrorism trial after the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks.
9343	APW_ENG_20071031.1490.LDC2009T13	The government said Richard Convertino, a former assistant U.S. attorney, so badly wanted to see convictions in the terrorism case, which went to trial in 2003, that he broke the law himself.
9344	APW_ENG_20071031.1490.LDC2009T13	But lawyers for Convertino argued he did nothing wrong and had no reason to conspire to hide evidence.
9345	APW_ENG_20071031.1490.LDC2009T13	The jury also acquitted Harry Smith III, an ex-U.S. State Department investigator, in the case.
9346	APW_ENG_20071031.1490.LDC2009T13	"It's a just end to a politically motivated prosecution," Convertino, 46, said after the verdict was read.
9347	APW_ENG_20071031.1490.LDC2009T13	Prosecutors say Convertino was e-mailed photos of a Jordanian hospital that should have been turned over to the defense at the 2003 trial.
9348	APW_ENG_20071031.1490.LDC2009T13	And prosecutors say Convertino allowed Smith to testify that it would be difficult to get photos of the hospital even though they both knew photos existed.
9349	APW_ENG_20071031.1490.LDC2009T13	"We believe in the case and the importance to the system and respect the jury's verdict," said government lawyer Daniel Schwager.
9350	APW_ENG_20071031.1490.LDC2009T13	The defense said the government didn't prove that Convertino intentionally withheld the photos and no conspiracy existed.
9351	APW_ENG_20071031.1490.LDC2009T13	Smith's lawyer Thomas Cranmer also argued that his client's testimony was truthful.
9352	APW_ENG_20071031.1490.LDC2009T13	Outside the courtroom, Cranmer said Smith was relieved by the verdict.
9353	APW_ENG_20071031.1490.LDC2009T13	"Overall, the prosecution's case -- at least to me -- didn't make sense and I was hopeful the jury would see that," Cranmer said.
9354	APW_ENG_20071031.1490.LDC2009T13	Jurors started deliberations in the case Wednesday morning following nearly three weeks of testimony before U.S. District Judge Arthur Tarnow, and reached the verdict after less than a day of deliberations.
9355	APW_ENG_20071031.1490.LDC2009T13	For two years, Convertino led the government's case against four North African men accused of operating a "sleeper" terrorist cell.
9356	APW_ENG_20071031.1490.LDC2009T13	Two of the four, Karim Koubriti and Abdel-Ilah Elmardoudi, were convicted in 2003 of conspiring to provide material support and resources to terrorists, and Convertino won praise from the Bush administration for his successful convictions.
9357	APW_ENG_20071031.1490.LDC2009T13	Smith helped in the investigation and testified for the government at the trial.
9358	APW_ENG_20071031.1490.LDC2009T13	A federal judge overturned the 2003 verdicts at the Justice Department's request after prosecutors discovered that some documents that could have aided the defense during the trial were not turned over by the government as required.
9359	APW_ENG_20071031.1490.LDC2009T13	Convertino and Smith were indicted last year on charges of obstruction of justice, making false declarations before a court and conspiracy.
9360	APW_ENG_20071031.1490.LDC2009T13	The indictment said the photographs of the Jordanian hospital could have helped defense lawyers at the 2003 trial undermine a government argument about how well a surveillance sketch of the hospital matched reality.
9361	APW_ENG_20071031.1490.LDC2009T13	The sketch was found in an apartment used by part of the suspected Detroit cell.
9362	APW_ENG_20071031.1490.LDC2009T13	But the defense at the current trial said the photos would have helped prosecutors at the 2003 trial.

9365	APW_ENG_20071101.0251.LDC2009T13	Police issued an arrest warrant Thursday for a suspected Canadian pedophile accused of sexually abusing several children, including an 8-year-old boy he allegedly lured to his hotel room in the Thai beach town of Pattaya.
9366	APW_ENG_20071101.0251.LDC2009T13	The arrest warrant for Orville Frank Mader, 54, was issued after the boy told police he had been sexually abused by the Canadian, police Lt. Sompol Nakkumpan said.
9367	APW_ENG_20071101.0251.LDC2009T13	Police believe he abused at least three other boys.
9368	APW_ENG_20071101.0251.LDC2009T13	"We are looking all over Pattaya for this man," Sompol said.
9369	APW_ENG_20071101.0251.LDC2009T13	"It's a small town and we will find him sooner or later."
9370	APW_ENG_20071101.0251.LDC2009T13	Immigration police at border crossing points and airports have been alerted in case Mader attempts to leave the country, he said.
9371	APW_ENG_20071101.0251.LDC2009T13	The case comes just weeks after a worldwide manhunt for another suspected pedophile ended with the arrest of Canadian Christopher Paul Neil in Thailand.
9372	APW_ENG_20071101.0251.LDC2009T13	Neil has been charged with child sexual abuse.
9373	APW_ENG_20071101.0251.LDC2009T13	Police found about 200 pictures on the Internet of Thai, Cambodian and Vietnamese boys being sexually abused by a man whose face was digitally obscured.
9374	APW_ENG_20071101.0251.LDC2009T13	German police computer experts unscrambled the photos so the man's face was recognizable and tip-offs led Interpol to identify Neil as a suspect.
9375	APW_ENG_20071101.0251.LDC2009T13	Neil and Mader frequented some of the same places, including a hotel in Pattaya, police said.
9376	APW_ENG_20071101.0251.LDC2009T13	Pattaya, a popular tourist destination, is known for its beaches, thriving sex industry and high crime rate.

9380	APW_ENG_20071101.0251.LDC2009T13	Paul Cornelius Jones, 39, who has lived in Thailand for seven years, was arrested Tuesday after police raided his Bangkok apartment and found a computer containing hundreds of photos of naked boys and girls, Apichart said.

9386	APW_ENG_20071106.0705.LDC2009T13	Pope Benedict XVI, who riled Muslims over his comments on Islam and violence, met for the first time Tuesday with the monarch of Saudi Arabia, which has been pressed by the Vatican to allow freedom of worship for Christians.
9387	APW_ENG_20071106.0705.LDC2009T13	Benedict warmly greeted King Abdullah, grasping both his hands before heading into 30 minutes of private talks in his library.
9388	APW_ENG_20071106.0705.LDC2009T13	The Vatican said Abdullah had requested the audience during his European tour.
9389	APW_ENG_20071106.0705.LDC2009T13	He had visited the Vatican twice before, as crown prince and deputy prime minister of the oil power.
9390	APW_ENG_20071106.0705.LDC2009T13	Benedict has said he wants to reach out to all countries that still don't have diplomatic relations with the Holy See
9391	APW_ENG_20071106.0705.LDC2009T13	they include Saudi Arabia and China.
9392	APW_ENG_20071106.0705.LDC2009T13	At the same time, Benedict and other Vatican officials have often protested that Christians are unable to worship openly in Saudi Arabia and are barred from opening churches in the desert kingdom.
9393	APW_ENG_20071106.0705.LDC2009T13	The Vatican newspaper L'Osservatore Romano said the Holy See hoped the meeting would produce a frank dialogue between the two sides over the issue, noting that there are more than 1 million Christian guest workers in Saudi Arabia.
9394	APW_ENG_20071106.0705.LDC2009T13	At the end of the meeting, Abdullah presented Benedict with a traditional Middle Eastern gift -- a golden sword studded with jewels -- as well as a gold and silver statue of a palm tree and man riding a camel.

9401	APW_ENG_20071112.0778.LDC2009T13	BERLIN 2007-11-12 15:01:08 UTC
9402	APW_ENG_20071112.0778.LDC2009T13	The German and French leaders called Monday for Russia and China to help increase pressure on Iran over its disputed nuclear program, and French President Nicolas Sarkozy said that Tehran must get "no nuclear weapon."
9403	APW_ENG_20071112.0778.LDC2009T13	Sarkozy recently has led European calls for tougher sanctions against Iran over its defiance of U.N. Security Council demands to halt uranium enrichment, which could be used both to generate nuclear power and create the fissile core of warheads.
9404	APW_ENG_20071112.0778.LDC2009T13	While France has suggested new European Union economic sanctions against Iran, Chancellor Angela Merkel has made clear that Germany wants to concentrate on negotiating sanctions at the U.N.
9405	APW_ENG_20071112.0778.LDC2009T13	Merkel said after the two countries' Cabinets held a twice-yearly meeting that there was "a very great level of agreement" on Iran.
9406	APW_ENG_20071112.0778.LDC2009T13	The two have "the common position that, if Iran does not change its stance, further sanctions must be considered in the U.N. framework," she told reporters at the chancellery.
9407	APW_ENG_20071112.0778.LDC2009T13	"We want to have Russia and China in the world community that makes clear to Iran that we cannot resign ourselves to this nuclear program."
9408	APW_ENG_20071112.0778.LDC2009T13	Russia and China, both veto-wielding permanent members of the Security Council, so far have been skeptical about further sanctions, advocated by the United States and other Western countries.
9409	APW_ENG_20071112.0778.LDC2009T13	Sarkozy said that both Germany and France "believe in the usefulness of sanctions."
9410	APW_ENG_20071112.0778.LDC2009T13	"Germany and France think that, for sanctions to be efficient, there must be unity in the international community, including China and Russia, and that we must maintain the line of dialogue at the same time as firm sanctions," he said.
9411	APW_ENG_20071112.0778.LDC2009T13	"We may have a problem of pace here or there, but on the big picture of this policy we are on the same wavelength: no nuclear weapon for Iran," Sarkozy said.
9412	APW_ENG_20071112.0778.LDC2009T13	"The door remains open, but the sanctions are toughening."
9413	APW_ENG_20071112.0778.LDC2009T13	Both Sarkozy and Merkel have discussed Iran with U.S. President George W. Bush during separate trans-Atlantic trips over the past week.
9414	APW_ENG_20071112.0778.LDC2009T13	Merkel has said she and Bush agreed that a diplomatic solution to the issue is still possible.
9415	APW_ENG_20071112.0778.LDC2009T13	Merkel stressed on Monday that European countries "want to reduce our own trade relations with Iran," noting the German government was restricting export guarantees and German banks had moved to halt business with Iran.
9416	APW_ENG_20071112.0778.LDC2009T13	Before their meeting at the chancellery, Merkel and Sarkozy went to a Berlin school to debate the challenges of integrating immigrants.
9417	APW_ENG_20071112.0778.LDC2009T13	Sarkozy, who has pushed legislation that institutes tests of language and fundamental French values, pressed home his argument that immigration needs to be controlled.
9418	APW_ENG_20071112.0778.LDC2009T13	"If we do not have the courage to master migratory flows, we will not succeed with integration," he said.

9420	APW_ENG_20071112.0778.LDC2009T13	they are not closed, they are not fortresses," he said.
9421	APW_ENG_20071112.0778.LDC2009T13	"But anyone who asks to come must respect the culture he wants to become his own."
9422	APW_ENG_20071112.0778.LDC2009T13	Berlin police said a 25-year-old man was detained after shouting insults at Merkel from the crowd after she visited the school with Sarkozy.

9424	APW_ENG_20071113.0103.LDC2009T13	TOKYO 2007-11-13 01:13:15 UTC
9425	APW_ENG_20071113.0103.LDC2009T13	Japan's economy grew at an annualized rate of 2.6 percent in the July-September quarter on strong exports, the government said Tuesday, but the outlook for further exports was clouded by sluggish economic signs in the United States.
9426	APW_ENG_20071113.0103.LDC2009T13	Gross domestic product grew a price-adjusted 0.6 percent from the previous quarter, according to preliminary data released by the Cabinet Office.
9427	APW_ENG_20071113.0103.LDC2009T13	On an annualized basis, the July-September GDP increased by 2.6 percent.
9428	APW_ENG_20071113.0103.LDC2009T13	The figures beat the annualized 1.8 percent gain forecast by economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires.
9429	APW_ENG_20071113.0103.LDC2009T13	In the April-June quarter, Japan's GDP declined 1.2 percent on an annual basis, marking the first contraction in growth for three quarters.
9430	APW_ENG_20071113.0103.LDC2009T13	Although the latest results suggest Japan's economy is still recovering, there are also worrying signs.
9431	APW_ENG_20071113.0103.LDC2009T13	Exports, which accounted for much of the third-quarter growth, are at a risk of decelerating because of a slowdown in the U.S. economy.
9432	APW_ENG_20071113.0103.LDC2009T13	Another sign is that housing investment, though its contribution is small, is declining.
9433	APW_ENG_20071113.0103.LDC2009T13	Private residential investment plunged 7.8 percent -- the largest drop since a 11.1 percent tumble in the April-June 1997 quarter -- likely hurt by tighter building regulations that came into force in late June.
9434	APW_ENG_20071113.0103.LDC2009T13	That was the third straight quarter of declines, after a revised 4.1 percent fall in the April-June period.
9435	APW_ENG_20071113.0103.LDC2009T13	Although housing investment accounts for only 3 percent of the GDP, its decline is a cause for worry because it could hurt factory output and business investment by cooling demand for construction materials and durable goods such as refrigerators and TVs.
9436	APW_ENG_20071113.0103.LDC2009T13	Such a slowdown in internal demand would mean that the Bank of Japan will likely have to wait until next year to lift short-term interest rates from the current 0.5 percent level.
9437	APW_ENG_20071113.0103.LDC2009T13	The data came before the central bank finishes its two-day monetary policy meeting later Tuesday.
9438	APW_ENG_20071113.0103.LDC2009T13	Most analysts expect the bank to leave short-term rates unchanged at 0.50 percent.
9439	APW_ENG_20071113.0103.LDC2009T13	In the July-September period, consumer spending, which accounts for more than half of Japan's GDP, rose 0.3 percent on quarter, better than a revised 0.2 percent rise in the April-June period.
9440	APW_ENG_20071113.0103.LDC2009T13	Solid sales in the travel industry attributed to the rise.
9441	APW_ENG_20071113.0103.LDC2009T13	Business investment rose 1.7 percent, rebounding from a revised 2.1 percent decline in the April-June period.
9442	APW_ENG_20071113.0103.LDC2009T13	Companies bought more general industrial machinery, according to the Cabinet Office.
9443	APW_ENG_20071113.0103.LDC2009T13	The data, meanwhile, indicate that Japan has so far withstood the impact of the slumping U.S. housing sector, which since August has roiled global stock markets, sank some hedge funds and caused the leaders of major U.S. banks to be sacked.
9444	APW_ENG_20071113.0103.LDC2009T13	Exports rose 2.9 percent, up for the 10th straight quarter and much faster than a revised 0.9 percent gain in the April-June quarter as Asian nations bought more Japanese goods, such as cars and motorcycles.
9445	APW_ENG_20071113.0103.LDC2009T13	Imports were up 0.5 percent, after gaining 0.8 percent in the second quarter, due in part to higher oil and natural resource prices.

9448	APW_ENG_20071113.1346.LDC2009T13	Tiger Woods was half-joking a few months ago when he suggested that Steve Stricker would be his pick as U.S. PGA Tour comeback player of the year, even though Stricker won the award last year.
9449	APW_ENG_20071113.1346.LDC2009T13	It could happen.
9450	APW_ENG_20071113.1346.LDC2009T13	The tour award ballots went in the mail last week to players, and Stricker is one of three candidates as comeback player of the year.
9451	APW_ENG_20071113.1346.LDC2009T13	The other two are Rocco Mediate, who finished 82nd on the money list after starting the season with a minor medical exemption
9452	APW_ENG_20071113.1346.LDC2009T13	and Brian Bateman, who earned the final card out of Q-school and won the Buick Open.
9453	APW_ENG_20071113.1346.LDC2009T13	Stricker won the award last year by starting 2006 with limited status and finishing 34th on the money list.
9454	APW_ENG_20071113.1346.LDC2009T13	He followed that by winning The Barclays for his first victory in more than six years, finishing second to Woods in the FedEx Cup, and moving to No. 4 in the world when his season ended.
9455	APW_ENG_20071113.1346.LDC2009T13	Woods and Phil Mickelson were the two choices for U.S. PGA Tour player of the year, while the candidates for rookie of the year were Greensboro winner Brandt Snedeker, Las Vegas winner George McNeill, and Anthony Kim, who was 60th on the money list.

9458	APW_ENG_20071113.1346.LDC2009T13	TOUR CUTS: One U.S. PGA Tour policy board decision came two weeks too late for players who languished through a long weekend at Disney, where 89 players made the cut.
9459	APW_ENG_20071113.1346.LDC2009T13	The board approved a change in 36-hole cuts to avoid such a large field on the weekend.
9460	APW_ENG_20071113.1346.LDC2009T13	Starting next year, the cut after two rounds will remain the top 70 professionals and ties.
9461	APW_ENG_20071113.1346.LDC2009T13	But if more than 78 players make the cut, only the closest number to 70 will make it to the weekend, and the others would be paid official, last-place money.
9462	APW_ENG_20071113.1346.LDC2009T13	The board first discussed this policy in change in May, and two names that came up during the discussion were Brad Faxon and Jose Maria Olazabal.
9463	APW_ENG_20071113.1346.LDC2009T13	Both have made the cut on the number and went on to win the tournament -- Faxon in 2005 at Hartford, Connecticut, and Olazabal in 2002 at Torrey Pines.
9464	APW_ENG_20071113.1346.LDC2009T13	At Hartford, 77 players made the cut so Faxon would have kept playing on his way to a 65-61 weekend.
9465	APW_ENG_20071113.1346.LDC2009T13	In Olazabal's case, however, 89 players made the cut.

9474	APW_ENG_20071114.0707.LDC2009T13	DUBLIN, Ireland 2007-11-14 13:00:54 UTC
9475	APW_ENG_20071114.0707.LDC2009T13	Ryanair Holdings PLC said Wednesday it is suing the European Commission over its refusal to investigate whether German government funding for a Munich airport terminal amounts to illegal state aid for Lufthansa AG.
9476	APW_ENG_20071114.0707.LDC2009T13	The suit filed in the European Court of First Instance, the second-highest EU court, is the latest salvo in an apparent tit- for-tat battle between Ryanair and EU competition authorities.
9477	APW_ENG_20071114.0707.LDC2009T13	For the past two years Ryanair has accused European leaders of demonstrating bias in favor of the continent's national flag carriers, citing a range of government financial supports benefiting Lufthansa, Air France, Alitalia and Olympic Airways of Greece.
9478	APW_ENG_20071114.0707.LDC2009T13	Ryanair has been subjected to a series of EU investigations into its deals with far-flung, small airports, most recently in July when investigators began probing whether Ryanair's exceptionally cheap contracts with three airports in Germany and Finland violated competition laws.
9479	APW_ENG_20071114.0707.LDC2009T13	The EU also is looking into Ryanair's contracts with airports in the Mediterranean islands of Sardinia and Malta.
9480	APW_ENG_20071114.0707.LDC2009T13	The Ryanair announcement came on the same day that European Consumer Affairs Commissioner Maglena Kuneva published a report alleging widespread deceptive practices in the on-line sales of airline tickets.
9481	APW_ENG_20071114.0707.LDC2009T13	The report did not single out Ryanair, which pioneered the rise of Web-based sales in Europe and is frequently criticized by consumer groups for its plethora of add-on charges, including for conventional check-ins and use of credit cards.
9482	APW_ENG_20071114.0707.LDC2009T13	But Kuneva warned that offending airlines would be identified in four months if they didn't reform how their Web sites tacked on costs to ticket prices.
9483	APW_ENG_20071114.0707.LDC2009T13	Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said Ryanair had waited two years for EU authorities to act on the airline's original complaint against German state aid to build and operate Terminal 2 in Munich.
9484	APW_ENG_20071114.0707.LDC2009T13	O'Leary said Lufthansa and its partner airlines enjoyed "exclusive use" of the terminal, which was built chiefly with more than euro1 billion (US$1.4 billion) in state aid.
9485	APW_ENG_20071114.0707.LDC2009T13	He said the terminal had run up losses exceeding euro100 million (US$140 million) annually.
9486	APW_ENG_20071114.0707.LDC2009T13	"No private investor would have invested in the loss-making facility and then granted exclusive access to just one airline.
9487	APW_ENG_20071114.0707.LDC2009T13	Lufthansa is therefore receiving substantial state aid at Munich Airport, which distorts competition in the European air transport market," O'Leary said.
9488	APW_ENG_20071114.0707.LDC2009T13	"Munich Airport's refusal to allow Ryanair to use this facility has subjected passengers in Bavaria to the stranglehold of Lufthansa's high fares and fuel surcharges," he said.
9489	APW_ENG_20071114.0707.LDC2009T13	Ryanair mounted a similarly themed lawsuit last week against the European Commission alleging it has ignored a previous Ryanair complaint against French government policies that allegedly favor Air France.
9490	APW_ENG_20071114.0707.LDC2009T13	That lawsuit was also filed in the European Court of First Instance.
9491	APW_ENG_20071114.0707.LDC2009T13	"The French government's operation of massively discounted domestic airport fees in France -- almost all of which supports Air France -- amounts to approximately euro1 billion (US$1.4 billion) of illegal state aid to the benefit of Air France, yet the commission has refused to do anything about this for the last 18 months," O'Leary said.
9492	APW_ENG_20071114.0707.LDC2009T13	EU antitrust authorities further annoyed Ryanair in June by rejecting its takeover terms for rival Irish carrier Aer Lingus, ruling that a combined operation would create a Ryanair monopoly in Ireland.
9493	APW_ENG_20071114.0707.LDC2009T13	The EU in this decade has approved a string of other European mergers involving Air France, Dutch carrier KLM, Lufthansa and the defunct Swissair.

9496	APW_ENG_20071116.0628.LDC2009T13	The Emirates' national air carrier denied Friday that any of its employees were among 10 people injured when an Airbus jet slammed into a wall during ground tests a day earlier.
9497	APW_ENG_20071116.0628.LDC2009T13	An Airbus spokesman also corrected the company's statement late Thursday that seven employees of Etihad Airways were injured, saying they in fact worked for a firm contracted to test the plane.
9498	APW_ENG_20071116.0628.LDC2009T13	Ten people were injured Thursday during engine tests of an Airbus 340-600 near the southwestern French city of Toulouse shortly before the jet was scheduled to be delivered to Abu Dhabi-based Etihad.
9499	APW_ENG_20071116.0628.LDC2009T13	Airbus said nine people on board were injured in the accident, along with one person on the ground.
9500	APW_ENG_20071116.0628.LDC2009T13	Airbus Chief Operating Officer Fabrice Bregier said late Thursday that seven Etihad employees were among the wounded.
9501	APW_ENG_20071116.0628.LDC2009T13	"It was normal for the client to be present on board the plane," Bregier said.
9502	APW_ENG_20071116.0628.LDC2009T13	However, Etihad denied on Friday that any of its employees were injured.
9503	APW_ENG_20071116.0628.LDC2009T13	"At the time of the incident, there were no members of Etihad staff on board of the Airbus plane, which was expected to be delivered to us next week," said Greg Moore, a spokesman for the Dubai-based public relations firm Four Communications, which represents Etihad.
9504	APW_ENG_20071116.0628.LDC2009T13	Jacques Rocca, an Airbus spokesman, said Friday that the seven non-Airbus staff on board the plane during the accident were employees of Abu Dhabi Aircraft Technologies, a contractor working for Etihad.
9505	APW_ENG_20071116.0628.LDC2009T13	Calls to the company for comment went unanswered Friday, the weekend in the Gulf.
9506	APW_ENG_20071116.0628.LDC2009T13	Airbus said in a statement that most of the wounded had been released from hospital by Friday.
9507	APW_ENG_20071116.0628.LDC2009T13	"Of the three persons remaining in hospital, one is an employee of Abu Dhabi Aircraft Technologies (ADAT), a service provider for Etihad Airways, and two are Airbus employees," the statement said.
9508	APW_ENG_20071116.0628.LDC2009T13	The incident took place during a final round of tests before anticipated delivery, in which the plane's engines are powered up full-throttle as the brakes are applied.
9509	APW_ENG_20071116.0628.LDC2009T13	French authorities ordered a technical investigation into the causes of the accident.

9511	APW_ENG_20071119.0433.LDC2009T13	JERUSALEM 2007-11-19 11:29:17 UTC
9512	APW_ENG_20071119.0433.LDC2009T13	Prime Minister Ehud Olmert on Monday told his Cabinet that Israel would not build any new settlements in the West Bank, but stopped short of American demands to freeze construction in existing communities before a crucial Mideast conference.
9513	APW_ENG_20071119.0433.LDC2009T13	Olmert will be traveling to Egypt on Tuesday to meet with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak ahead of a key Arab League meeting where member states will decide whether to attend the U.S.-sponsored meeting next week and demonstrate their support for renewed peace moves.
9514	APW_ENG_20071119.0433.LDC2009T13	A settlement freeze and a related dismantling of settlement outposts that Olmert also promised are key aspects of the "road map," a U.S.-backed peace plan that stalled shortly after its inception in 2003.
9515	APW_ENG_20071119.0433.LDC2009T13	The U.S. has been trying to revive the road map ahead of the peace conference, which is expected to take place in Annapolis, Maryland.
9516	APW_ENG_20071119.0433.LDC2009T13	"Let's be straight, we committed ourselves in the road map not to build new settlements and we will not build any," Olmert was quoted as saying by his spokeswoman, Miri Eisin.
9517	APW_ENG_20071119.0433.LDC2009T13	Palestinian officials reacted coolly to Olmert's statement, which came shortly before a meeting later in the day with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas.
9518	APW_ENG_20071119.0433.LDC2009T13	The two leaders have been meeting frequently to lay the groundwork for the U.S. conference, and one Palestinian negotiator said there were "serious problems" in the preparations.
9519	APW_ENG_20071119.0433.LDC2009T13	Olmert has been under American pressure to make goodwill gestures to Abbas, including a settlement freeze and a large-scale release of Palestinian prisoners, ahead of next week's summit.
9520	APW_ENG_20071119.0433.LDC2009T13	Olmert asked his Cabinet on Monday to release release 450 Palestinian prisoners before the meeting -- a far smaller number than the Palestinians had sought.
9521	APW_ENG_20071119.0433.LDC2009T13	The proposal was expected to pass.
9522	APW_ENG_20071119.0433.LDC2009T13	At the summit, Israel and the Palestinians hope to renew formal peace talks, which broke down in violence seven years ago.
9523	APW_ENG_20071119.0433.LDC2009T13	The U.S. also hopes the gathering will give an international boost to Abbas in his power struggle against the Hamas militant group, which now controls the Gaza Strip.
9524	APW_ENG_20071119.0433.LDC2009T13	However, preparations have run into trouble.
9525	APW_ENG_20071119.0433.LDC2009T13	The Palestinians want the conference to address issues at the heart of the conflict with Israel, such as the borders of a future Palestinian state, shared sovereignty over disputed Jerusalem and the fate of Palestinian refugees.
9526	APW_ENG_20071119.0433.LDC2009T13	Israel says the summit should be a launching pad for peace talks, with discussions on core issues to follow.
9527	APW_ENG_20071119.0433.LDC2009T13	"The negotiations will start after Annapolis and it will be very intensive, very serious," Olmert told reporters at the beginning of the Cabinet meeting.
9528	APW_ENG_20071119.0433.LDC2009T13	"It will deal with all the core issues that are a part of the process that has to lead for two nation states for two nations."
9529	APW_ENG_20071119.0433.LDC2009T13	Amid the disagreements, the U.S. has not announced an official date or invitation list for the summit.
9530	APW_ENG_20071119.0433.LDC2009T13	"We have serious, serious problems," Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said, urging more American involvement.
9531	APW_ENG_20071119.0433.LDC2009T13	Abbas said he hoped his meeting with Olmert in Jerusalem would yield progress.
9532	APW_ENG_20071119.0433.LDC2009T13	"We want to continue our talks regarding the preparation for Annapolis, and we need to hear from him (Olmert) things that will satisfy us, so we can go to Annapolis on a solid basis," Abbas told reporters.
9533	APW_ENG_20071119.0433.LDC2009T13	The road map is a phased peace plan that calls for the establishment of an independent Palestinian state.
9534	APW_ENG_20071119.0433.LDC2009T13	Its first stage calls on Israel to freeze all settlement construction and remove dozens of unauthorized settlement outposts built since 2001 -- steps that were never taken.
9535	APW_ENG_20071119.0433.LDC2009T13	The plan also requires the Palestinians to crack down on militants.
9536	APW_ENG_20071119.0433.LDC2009T13	The Palestinians say they've been carrying out their obligations -- something Israel disputes -- and want Israel to do the same.
9537	APW_ENG_20071119.0433.LDC2009T13	Erekat said Olmert's gesture fell far short of Israel's commitments.
9538	APW_ENG_20071119.0433.LDC2009T13	He noted that a string of Israeli leaders have maintained that Israel should be allowed to build in existing settlements to account for "natural growth."

9597	APW_ENG_20071122.1136.LDC2009T13	The Commonwealth said Thursday it had suspended Pakistan until the restoration of democracy after military ruler Gen. Pervez Musharraf failed to meet a Thursday deadline to lift emergency rule and step down as army chief.
9598	APW_ENG_20071122.1136.LDC2009T13	A committee of foreign ministers "has suspended Pakistan from councils of the Commonwealth pending restoration of democracy and rule of law in the country," secretary general Don McKinnon told journalists.
9599	APW_ENG_20071122.1136.LDC2009T13	He said the group was disappointed because there had been some progress -- and cited the release of detainees -- but said it was concerned about the arrests of journalists and lawyers and said the Commonwealth's conditions had not been fulfilled.
9600	APW_ENG_20071122.1136.LDC2009T13	"The state of emergency had not been lifted.
9601	APW_ENG_20071122.1136.LDC2009T13	The constitution and the independence of the judiciary not restored and fundamental rights and the rule of law remain curtailed," McKinnon said, reading a statement on behalf of the ministers.
9602	APW_ENG_20071122.1136.LDC2009T13	On Thursday, a Pakistani Supreme Court stacked with judges loyal to Musharraf cleared the way for him to rule as a civilian president, deciding against a final challenge blocking ratification of his election last month.
9603	APW_ENG_20071122.1136.LDC2009T13	Pakistan was last kicked out of the organization in 1999 after Musharraf seized power in a coup.
9604	APW_ENG_20071122.1136.LDC2009T13	It took the country five years to be reinstated.
9605	APW_ENG_20071122.1136.LDC2009T13	Suspending a member of the 53-member group, based upon Britain and its former colonies, was done "with a heavy heart" because every Commonwealth member "is a valued member" said Michael Frendo, Malta's foreign minister who chaired the committee's meeting.
9606	APW_ENG_20071122.1136.LDC2009T13	But he said the suspension was "done with the conviction of the need to be consistent and to be coherent and to be true to the sensibilities of the Commonwealth."
9607	APW_ENG_20071122.1136.LDC2009T13	In a statement, British Prime Minister Gordon Brown said: "Commonwealth Ministers have made their clear and necessary decision on suspension of Pakistan from the Commonwealth.

9618	APW_ENG_20071122.1136.LDC2009T13	The queen visited an AIDS clinic in the Ugandan capital, Kampala, before her speech to Parliament.

9637	APW_ENG_20071207.1401.LDC2009T13	British investment group Olivant came forward with a detailed rescue offer for mortgage lender Northern Rock PLC on Friday as U.S. investment firm JC Flowers reportedly pulled out of the bidding process.
9638	APW_ENG_20071207.1401.LDC2009T13	The offer from Olivant, which includes immediately repaying up to 15 billion pounds (US$30.5 billion
9639	APW_ENG_20071207.1401.LDC2009T13	euro20.96 billion) of the government funds propping up Northern Rock, could be a strong contender to the current preferred bid from Richard Branson's Virgin Group.
9640	APW_ENG_20071207.1401.LDC2009T13	Olivant chief Luqman Arnold, a buyout veteran, said he was confident his proposal would win favor with the government and shareholders.

9659	APW_ENG_20071207.1401.LDC2009T13	euro209 million) would be made by Olivant on completion of the rights issue and at a price equal to the rights issue subscription price.

9661	APW_ENG_20071207.1401.LDC2009T13	The European Commission gave the bidding process some fresh oxygen earlier this week by clearing the state aid that kept Northern Rock afloat after it fell victim to the global credit crisis.

9666	APW_ENG_20071207.1401.LDC2009T13	As spooked customers made a run on the bank to retrieve their savings, the government also announced it would guarantee all personal funds held by the lender up to 35,000 pounds (US$70,900

9675	APW_ENG_20071207.1609.LDC2009T13	Kott was convicted in September of bribery, extortion and conspiracy and acquitted of wire fraud.

9695	APW_ENG_20071214.0802.LDC2009T13	LONDON 2007-12-14 15:05:28 UTC
9696	APW_ENG_20071214.0802.LDC2009T13	Following reports of depression and suicide in patients taking the anti-smoking drug Champix, the European Union's medicine authority has begun investigating its safety.
9697	APW_ENG_20071214.0802.LDC2009T13	On Friday, the European Medicines Agency asked Champix's maker, Pfizer Inc., to submit more information about the incidences of depression and suicide in patients taking the drug.
9698	APW_ENG_20071214.0802.LDC2009T13	"Based on a preliminary review of patient reports, our committee concluded this could signal a problem," said Monika Benstetter, a spokeswoman for the EU agency, which authorizes medicines for use in the 27-nation bloc.
9699	APW_ENG_20071214.0802.LDC2009T13	As part of its routine drug surveillance, the agency reviewed cases of Champix patients who had suicidal thoughts or attempted suicide from July, October and November.
9700	APW_ENG_20071214.0802.LDC2009T13	Champix was licensed for sale as a smoking cessation aid in the European Union last September.
9701	APW_ENG_20071214.0802.LDC2009T13	The drug works by binding to nicotine receptors in the brain, as well as by reducing the symptoms of withdrawal.
9702	APW_ENG_20071214.0802.LDC2009T13	Champix is available as tablets, and must be taken under medical supervision.
9703	APW_ENG_20071214.0802.LDC2009T13	At a meeting this month, the EU agency concluded that "there is a need to update the product information for Champix to warn doctors and patients that depression has been reported in patients who are trying to stop smoking using Champix."
9704	APW_ENG_20071214.0802.LDC2009T13	Pfizer said that it is working closely with the EU agency to review cases of depression and suicidal thoughts in patients taking Champix.
9705	APW_ENG_20071214.0802.LDC2009T13	"There is no scientific evidence establishing a causal relationship between Champix and these reported events," a company statement said.
9706	APW_ENG_20071214.0802.LDC2009T13	Experts acknowledged that establishing a causal relationship between taking Champix and depression or suicide would be difficult.
9707	APW_ENG_20071214.0802.LDC2009T13	American regulators have said that nicotine withdrawal could aggravate existing mental problems.
9708	APW_ENG_20071214.0802.LDC2009T13	But not all experts agreed.
9709	APW_ENG_20071214.0802.LDC2009T13	"Coming off smoking may make people depressed, but there's little evidence for the re-emergence of major psychiatric illness," said Dr. Peter Hajek, director of the Tobacco Dependence Research Unit at Queen Mary University Hospital in London.
9710	APW_ENG_20071214.0802.LDC2009T13	The EU agency's decision follows reports from the United States last month, where the drug is sold as Chantix, that at least one patient died while taking it.
9711	APW_ENG_20071214.0802.LDC2009T13	Family members of Dallas musician Carter Albrecht said the Pfizer drug may have caused the rage that ultimately led to his death.
9712	APW_ENG_20071214.0802.LDC2009T13	Albrecht was shot in the head in September by his girlfriend's neighbor as he tried to kick down the man's door.
9713	APW_ENG_20071214.0802.LDC2009T13	An autopsy report showed Albrecht's blood alcohol was three times the legal limit.
9714	APW_ENG_20071214.0802.LDC2009T13	The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said it asked Pfizer for information on additional cases that might be similar.
9715	APW_ENG_20071214.0802.LDC2009T13	In Europe, the EU agency has asked Pfizer to submit modified product information next week that warns doctors and patients about the potential for depression or suicide in patients taking Champix.
9716	APW_ENG_20071214.0802.LDC2009T13	The drug's current product information does not include any warnings about suicidal thoughts.
9717	APW_ENG_20071214.0802.LDC2009T13	Further action could be taken if warranted, Benstetter said.
9718	APW_ENG_20071214.0802.LDC2009T13	Hajek said that more information was needed before a real link between Champix and depression or suicide could be confirmed.
9719	APW_ENG_20071214.0802.LDC2009T13	"So far, these are just anecdotal reports," Hajek said.
9720	APW_ENG_20071214.0802.LDC2009T13	"We need to see a more established pattern from more data."

9801	APW_ENG_20071221.0636.LDC2009T13	A group representing German restaurant and bar owners said Friday it has filed a challenge to the country's supreme court against new laws that restrict smoking.
9802	APW_ENG_20071221.0636.LDC2009T13	Several German states recently have introduced, or plan to introduce, partial bans on smoking in restaurants and bars, although the restrictions generally have fallen short of near- total bans on smoking in enclosed spaces elsewhere in Europe.
9803	APW_ENG_20071221.0636.LDC2009T13	The industry group, DEHOGA, said it joined in a suit filed to the Federal Constitutional Court by an inn owner in the southwestern state of Baden-Wuerttemberg, which on Aug. 1 became one of the first to introduce curbs on smoking.
9804	APW_ENG_20071221.0636.LDC2009T13	The state's ban, like most others in Germany, allowed for special rooms to be set aside for smokers, but DEHOGA argued that that puts owners of one-room bars, such as the plaintiff, at a disadvantage.
9805	APW_ENG_20071221.0636.LDC2009T13	It said the man, whose customers were 70 percent smokers, had seen his turnover decline by more than 30 percent in the August- November period from a year earlier.

9811	APW_ENG_20071221.0793.LDC2009T13	NEW YORK 2007-12-21 15:13:25 UTC
9812	APW_ENG_20071221.0793.LDC2009T13	Oil prices rose Friday after the government reported that consumer spending surged last month, raising hopes that the U.S. economy will weather the crisis roiling credit markets and that demand for oil and gasoline will strengthen.
9813	APW_ENG_20071221.0793.LDC2009T13	The Commerce Department said consumer spending jumped 1.1 percent in November, the biggest one-month gain since 2004 and well above analyst expectations for an 0.7 percent increase.
9814	APW_ENG_20071221.0793.LDC2009T13	That news countered Thursday's report from the Conference Board that its index of leading indicators dropped 0.4 percent in November to the lowest level in more than two years, suggesting the economy was headed for a slowdown.
9815	APW_ENG_20071221.0793.LDC2009T13	Light, sweet crude for February delivery rose 67 cents to $91.73 on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
9816	APW_ENG_20071221.0793.LDC2009T13	A slightly weaker dollar also supported oil prices Friday.
9817	APW_ENG_20071221.0793.LDC2009T13	Oil futures offer a hedge against a weak dollar, and oil futures bought and sold in dollars are more attractive to foreign investors when the greenback is falling.
9818	APW_ENG_20071221.0793.LDC2009T13	Many observers blame oil's rise last month to near $100 on speculators driven to oil futures by the weaker dollar.
9819	APW_ENG_20071221.0793.LDC2009T13	While oil prices were higher Friday, trading volumes ahead of the holidays were low.
9820	APW_ENG_20071221.0793.LDC2009T13	A similar pattern of light trading led to a choppy day Thursday.
9821	APW_ENG_20071221.0793.LDC2009T13	"Many traders seem to have quit trading for the year and others are less active," said Peter Beutel, president of the energy risk management firm Cameron Hanover, in a research note.
9822	APW_ENG_20071221.0793.LDC2009T13	Crude futures have since retreated as OPEC boosted supplies and several forecasters cut demand predictions.
9823	APW_ENG_20071221.0793.LDC2009T13	But in recent weeks, prices have held generally to a range between $88 and $92, leading some analysts to conclude investors are seeking direction and may be poised to make another push for $100 a barrel in the new year.
9824	APW_ENG_20071221.0793.LDC2009T13	"The markets are looking for something that will provide that sense of trend that is currently missing," Beutel said.
9825	APW_ENG_20071221.0793.LDC2009T13	Because of the holidays, it may be a while before a trend emerges, analysts say.
9826	APW_ENG_20071221.0793.LDC2009T13	"We most likely will have to wait until mid-January for volume to pick up in most complexes, as (investors) decide which of the countervailing factors at work are likely to dominate the early innings of the New Year," said Edward Meir, an analyst at MF Global UK Ltd., in a research note.
9827	APW_ENG_20071221.0793.LDC2009T13	Other energy futures were mixed Friday.

9844	APW_ENG_20080104.1098.LDC2009T13	TRENTON, New Jersey 2008-01-04 20:44:50 UTC
9845	APW_ENG_20080104.1098.LDC2009T13	New Jersey on Friday became one of at least three U.S. states to prohibit state pension money from being invested in companies doing business in Iran.
9846	APW_ENG_20080104.1098.LDC2009T13	Most American companies are already barred from doing business in the country, but Democratic Gov. Jon S. Corzine signed a measure restricting the state from buying stock in international companies that do business with Iran.
9847	APW_ENG_20080104.1098.LDC2009T13	The move is designed to protest the country's links to terrorism and its nuclear ambitions.
9848	APW_ENG_20080104.1098.LDC2009T13	"I continue to support using economic means, not military means, to bring about policy changes in Iran," Corzine said recently when discussing the bill signed privately on Friday.
9849	APW_ENG_20080104.1098.LDC2009T13	Florida and California have similar laws.
9850	APW_ENG_20080104.1098.LDC2009T13	Florida's law also banned investments in Sudan, and the board governing Florida's public employee retirement fund authorized it to divest nearly $1.3 billion (euro880,000 million) invested with 21 companies doing business in the two nations.
9851	APW_ENG_20080104.1098.LDC2009T13	California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger in October signed legislation to end state investment in companies that do business with Iran.
9852	APW_ENG_20080104.1098.LDC2009T13	New Jersey Assemblyman Neil Cohen, a Democrat who helped sponsor the bill, cited Iranian threats against Israel.
9853	APW_ENG_20080104.1098.LDC2009T13	"Divesting our finances from entities associated with Iran will send a clear message in the universal language of money that New Jersey will have no part in Iran's pursuit of actions that would lead to Holocaust-like genocide and the complete destruction of a sovereign nation," Cohen said.
9854	APW_ENG_20080104.1098.LDC2009T13	The New Jersey proposal mirrors a 2005 bill that prohibited investing state pension funds in companies doing business in Sudan to protest what the United States has deemed a genocide in the African nation.
9855	APW_ENG_20080104.1098.LDC2009T13	New Jersey also passed a similar law in the 1980s barring investments in South Africa.
9856	APW_ENG_20080104.1098.LDC2009T13	The state's pension fund is worth about $80 billion (euro54 billion), though it was unclear how much is invested in companies doing business in Iran.
9857	APW_ENG_20080104.1098.LDC2009T13	The law requires the state to hire an independent research firm specializing in global securities to identify such investments.
9858	APW_ENG_20080104.1098.LDC2009T13	New Jersey's pension fund is the nation's ninth largest.

9862	APW_ENG_20080106.0292.LDC2009T13	TBILISI, Georgia 2008-01-06 10:36:00 UTC
9863	APW_ENG_20080106.0292.LDC2009T13	President Mikhail Saakashvili headed for victory in Georgia's election, according to an exit poll and early results released Sunday, but the opposition claimed the vote was rigged and called for protests.
9864	APW_ENG_20080106.0292.LDC2009T13	Saakashvili's supporters waved flags and tooted car horns in the capital after the exit poll showed him winning 53.8 percent of the vote Saturday.
9865	APW_ENG_20080106.0292.LDC2009T13	But the poll had a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points -- casting doubt on whether the president would hang onto the absolute majority needed to avoid a runoff.
9866	APW_ENG_20080106.0292.LDC2009T13	Early results released by the Central Election Commission Sunday also indicated Saakashvili was poised for victory.
9867	APW_ENG_20080106.0292.LDC2009T13	With some 3 percent of precincts counted, Saakashvili had 61.5 percent, while his main challenger Levan Gachechiladze received 21.3 percent.
9868	APW_ENG_20080106.0292.LDC2009T13	Gachechiladze, received 28.3 percent of the vote, according to the exit poll, which the opposition said was falsified.
9869	APW_ENG_20080106.0292.LDC2009T13	About two hours before the polls closed Saturday night, the head of an international election-monitoring mission said the election appeared fair.
9870	APW_ENG_20080106.0292.LDC2009T13	"From what we're seeing now ... there does not appear to be anything to suggest there is an election being stolen," said U.S. Rep. Alcee Hastings, heading a mission sent by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.
9871	APW_ENG_20080106.0292.LDC2009T13	But opposition leaders said the campaign was held under unfair conditions and claimed there were widespread violations during the vote.
9872	APW_ENG_20080106.0292.LDC2009T13	Gachechiladze, speaking on television early Sunday, claimed he had won in most precincts and the vote count was being held under conditions of "terror."
9873	APW_ENG_20080106.0292.LDC2009T13	He called for protests Sunday afternoon, urging "all of Georgia to come to make sure we don't lose our country."
9874	APW_ENG_20080106.0292.LDC2009T13	Saakashvili, while still waiting for official results, said the exit poll showed him winning and called for reconciliation in a speech to supporters at a celebratory concert.
9875	APW_ENG_20080106.0292.LDC2009T13	"If the final results confirm that I have won in the first round, then I will assume the honor and responsibility to serve all of Georgia for the next five years," he said.
9876	APW_ENG_20080106.0292.LDC2009T13	"I'm extending my hand to those who voted for me and to those who took part in the elections," he said.
9877	APW_ENG_20080106.0292.LDC2009T13	The U.S.-educated Saakashvili led mass street protests that ousted a Communist-era veteran from power following fraudulent elections in late 2003.
9878	APW_ENG_20080106.0292.LDC2009T13	He won a January 2004 election with more than 96 percent of the vote and set out to transform the bankrupt country into a modern European state.
9879	APW_ENG_20080106.0292.LDC2009T13	Now the Rose Revolution hero, who was much lauded in the West, is accused by his opponents at home of sidelining his critics and displaying an authoritarian bent.
9880	APW_ENG_20080106.0292.LDC2009T13	After casting his ballot in Tbilisi, Saakashvili said he was dedicated to having a free and fair election.
9881	APW_ENG_20080106.0292.LDC2009T13	"We are committed to having Georgia as a beacon of democracy in our part of the world," he said.
9882	APW_ENG_20080106.0292.LDC2009T13	Saakashvili's opponents took to the streets in November, holding peaceful demonstrations for five days before police violently dispersed them.
9883	APW_ENG_20080106.0292.LDC2009T13	Saakashvili imposed a state of emergency that included banning independent TV news broadcasts.
9884	APW_ENG_20080106.0292.LDC2009T13	The violent crackdown angered many Georgians and called into question Saakashvili's commitment to democracy.
9885	APW_ENG_20080106.0292.LDC2009T13	Saakashvili defused the crisis by calling an early election, cutting short his own five-year term.
9886	APW_ENG_20080106.0292.LDC2009T13	A runoff vote could allow the opposition, now split among six candidates, to unite behind Gachechiladze, a businessman and lawmaker.
9887	APW_ENG_20080106.0292.LDC2009T13	Gachechiladze, 43, represents an opposition coalition that wants to do away with the presidency.
9888	APW_ENG_20080106.0292.LDC2009T13	If a parliamentary system is established, as the coalition wants, he would step down.
9889	APW_ENG_20080106.0292.LDC2009T13	The opposition has been undermined by a scandal that has discredited one of the leading candidates, billionaire Badri Patarkatsishvili.
9890	APW_ENG_20080106.0292.LDC2009T13	He has been accused of plotting to overthrow the government and has acknowledged offering large sums of money to police if they side with protesters.
9891	APW_ENG_20080106.0292.LDC2009T13	Georgian authorities say he offered US$100 million (euro68 million).
9892	APW_ENG_20080106.0292.LDC2009T13	The exit poll showed Patarkatsishvili finishing third with 6.2 percent of the vote.
9893	APW_ENG_20080106.0292.LDC2009T13	Saakashvili says the election has put at stake his plan to transform Georgia into a country worthy of membership in NATO and the European Union.
9894	APW_ENG_20080106.0292.LDC2009T13	Sixty-one percent of voters approved of joining the Western military alliance in a referendum that was held alongside the Saturday election, according to the exit poll.
9895	APW_ENG_20080106.0292.LDC2009T13	During his four years in office, he has cracked down on organized crime and corruption, modernized the police force and the army, restored steady supplies of electricity and gas, and improved roads.
9896	APW_ENG_20080106.0292.LDC2009T13	The result has been annual economic growth of about 10 percent and a steady rise in foreign investment.
9897	APW_ENG_20080106.0292.LDC2009T13	The economic success has not yet defeated poverty, and after the November protests, Saakashvili made social welfare one of his top priorities.

9902	APW_ENG_20080106.0369.LDC2009T13	British Prime Minister Gordon Brown on Sunday appealed for Kenya's political leaders to urgently hold talks to end a political deadlock that sparked a week of deadly riots.
9903	APW_ENG_20080106.0369.LDC2009T13	Brown spoke after opposition leader Raila Odinga said he was ready to join mediated talks with President Mwai Kibaki, who he accuses of rigging the Dec. 27 election to stay in power.
9904	APW_ENG_20080106.0369.LDC2009T13	"I think Mr. Odinga and Mr. Kibaki both recognize that unless they make a change, unless something happens that brings them together, the prospects for Kenya are very poor indeed," Brown told British Broadcasting Corp. television.
9905	APW_ENG_20080106.0369.LDC2009T13	"We have been working night and day behind the scenes to see what we can do to bring the sides together," Brown said.
9906	APW_ENG_20080106.0369.LDC2009T13	The prime minister said he had spoken to Ghanian President John Kufuor, chairman of the African Union, who he said is expected to arrive in Nairobi by Tuesday to mediate.
9907	APW_ENG_20080106.0369.LDC2009T13	"I think there is a chance of reconciliation," Brown said.
9908	APW_ENG_20080106.0369.LDC2009T13	Britain, the former colonial power in Kenya, appealed last week for both sides to consider sharing power, but the opposition has rejected an offer from the president to form a unity government.

9911	APW_ENG_20080109.0836.LDC2009T13	Thousands of Palestinian hard-liners in Gaza staged protests against George W. Bush on Wednesday, burning Bush in effigy and underscoring the deep political split with West Bank moderates who welcomed the visit of the U.S. president as an important gesture to the Palestinians.
9912	APW_ENG_20080109.0836.LDC2009T13	Supporters of the Islamic militant Hamas chanted "Death to America," and burned U.S. and Israeli flags.
9913	APW_ENG_20080109.0836.LDC2009T13	A shadowy al-Qaida- inspired group appeared in public for the first time with rifles and rocket-propelled grenade launchers, and uttered vague threats against U.S. targets.
9914	APW_ENG_20080109.0836.LDC2009T13	Bush arrived in Israel on Wednesday for a three-day visit that also includes a meeting in the West Bank on Thursday with moderate Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, as well as a pilgrimage to Jesus' traditional birth grotto in biblical Bethlehem.
9915	APW_ENG_20080109.0836.LDC2009T13	A senior Abbas aide, Yasser Abed Rabbo, said the Bush visit was an important opportunity for the Palestinians to make their demands heard.
9916	APW_ENG_20080109.0836.LDC2009T13	"By receiving Bush, we are not conceding our rights," Abed Rabbo said, addressing critics at home.
9917	APW_ENG_20080109.0836.LDC2009T13	"We are focusing on our rights before the entire world, and we will say there will be no peace in the region, and no peace in the world without people obtaining these rights."
9918	APW_ENG_20080109.0836.LDC2009T13	However, polls indicate that the vast majority of Palestinians are either indifferent to U.S. peace promises or deeply skeptical a deal with Israel can be negotiated.
9919	APW_ENG_20080109.0836.LDC2009T13	The U.S. administration is widely perceived in the Palestinian territories as a friend and ally of Israel, at the expense of the Palestinians.
9920	APW_ENG_20080109.0836.LDC2009T13	In an arrival ceremony at Israel's Ben Gurion International Airport, Bush appeared to confirm such perceptions, emphasizing an U.S.-Israel alliance that he said "helps guarantee Israel's security as a Jewish state."
9921	APW_ENG_20080109.0836.LDC2009T13	The Palestinians have balked at Israel's demand that they recognize Israel as a Jewish state, amid concerns that this would block future negotiations on the fate of Palestinian refugees who lost their homes in the war that surrounded Israel's establishment in 1948.
9922	APW_ENG_20080109.0836.LDC2009T13	Bush also said he sees an opportunity for peace in the Holy Land.
9923	APW_ENG_20080109.0836.LDC2009T13	In Hamas-ruled Gaza, about 5,000 supporters of the Islamic militant group marched in the streets to protest the visit, burning effigies of Bush and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert.
9924	APW_ENG_20080109.0836.LDC2009T13	Some held posters showing a dog biting Bush's head, and of a young man stepping on Bush's head with his shoe.
9925	APW_ENG_20080109.0836.LDC2009T13	Mahmoud Zahar, a leading Hamas hard-liner, told Hamas radio that "whoever holds much hope for the visit will be disappointed."
9926	APW_ENG_20080109.0836.LDC2009T13	Even some Abbas supporters were critical of the U.S. leader.
9927	APW_ENG_20080109.0836.LDC2009T13	Some 200 supporters allied with Abbas' Fatah movement and other secular Palestinian factions urged Bush to abandon what they said was his pro-Israel bias.

9949	APW_ENG_20080110.0220.LDC2009T13	MELBOURNE, Australia 2008-01-10 04:42:43 UTC
9950	APW_ENG_20080110.0220.LDC2009T13	Australian aluminum producer Alumina Ltd. downgraded its underlying earnings forecast for last year by 17 percent Thursday to 405 million Australian dollars (US$358 million
9951	APW_ENG_20080110.0220.LDC2009T13	euro244 million).
9952	APW_ENG_20080110.0220.LDC2009T13	It said lower-than-expected aluminum prices, higher costs and a stronger Australian dollar led to the downgrade in its announcement of the revision to the Australian Securities Exchange.
9953	APW_ENG_20080110.0220.LDC2009T13	It had forecast in July 2007 underlying earnings of $A490 million (US$433 million
9954	APW_ENG_20080110.0220.LDC2009T13	euro295 million) for the year to Dec. 31, 2007.
9955	APW_ENG_20080110.0220.LDC2009T13	Alumina's chief financial officer Ken Dean said the cost pressures that forced the earnings downgrade look set to continue in 2008.
9956	APW_ENG_20080110.0220.LDC2009T13	Dean said rising freight and energy prices accounted for much of the production cost increases and the company does not expect any relief from these in 2008.
9957	APW_ENG_20080110.0220.LDC2009T13	"We don't necessarily see them getting worse, but we don't really think the 2008 outlook looks very different to the second half of 2007," he told Dow Jones Newswires.
9958	APW_ENG_20080110.0220.LDC2009T13	Dean said he believes, though, given the outlook for the market, that there is now potential for aluminum prices to rise.
9959	APW_ENG_20080110.0220.LDC2009T13	"I think there are some fundamentals that give you some indication that sooner or later the higher costs of production will flow through to higher realized prices," he said.
9960	APW_ENG_20080110.0220.LDC2009T13	Alumina said the July forecast had assumed an average 2007 aluminum price on the London Metal Exchange of US$1.24 per pound and an exchange rate of 83 U.S. cents to one Australian dollar.
9961	APW_ENG_20080110.0220.LDC2009T13	But the company now says that the average aluminum price for last year had come in at US$1.21 per pound and the average exchange rate for the year was 84 U.S. cents to the Australian unit.
9962	APW_ENG_20080110.0220.LDC2009T13	Refining costs were also substantially higher for 2007 than was earlier estimated.

9977	APW_ENG_20080114.0745.LDC2009T13	Shares of Sears Holdings Corp. tumbled Monday after the retailer warned falling sales would force it to post fourth-quarter and full-year earnings well below analyst estimates.
9978	APW_ENG_20080114.0745.LDC2009T13	The retailer, led by hedge fund manager Edward Lampert, said it anticipates earning between $350 million (euro234.98 million) and $470 million (euro315.54 million), or $2.59 (euro1.74) to $3.48 (euro2.34) per share for the quarter ending Feb. 2.
9979	APW_ENG_20080114.0745.LDC2009T13	For the year, the company forecast earnings of $744 million (euro499.5 million) to $864 million (euro580.06 million), or $5.13 (euro3.44) per share to $5.96 (euro4) per share.
9980	APW_ENG_20080114.0745.LDC2009T13	Analysts polled by Thomson Financial had hoped for fourth-quarter earnings of $4.43 (euro2.97) per share and a full-year profit of $6.64 (euro4.46) per share
9981	APW_ENG_20080114.0745.LDC2009T13	Shares fell $7.63, or 7.9 percent, to $88.54 in morning trading Monday after briefly falling to a 52-week low of $86.04.
9982	APW_ENG_20080114.0745.LDC2009T13	The ailing Hoffman Estates-based company, which owns Sears and Kmart stores, said it lowered earnings projections after sales continued to slump.
9983	APW_ENG_20080114.0745.LDC2009T13	Domestic same-store sales fell 3.5 percent during the nine-week holiday season in November and December because of weakness in Kmart's seasonal categories and Sears' apparel and tools.
9984	APW_ENG_20080114.0745.LDC2009T13	The decline was partially offset by higher sales of home electronics.
9985	APW_ENG_20080114.0745.LDC2009T13	The company said Sears domestic same-store sales slipped 2.8 percent for the nine-week period that ended Jan. 5, while Kmart same-store sales dropped 4.2 percent.
9986	APW_ENG_20080114.0745.LDC2009T13	Same-store sales, or sales at stores open at least a year, are a key indicator of retailer performance that measures growth at existing stores instead of newly opened ones.
9987	APW_ENG_20080114.0745.LDC2009T13	Sears blamed the poor performance on growing competition, the slowdown in the housing market and consumers' credit fears.
9988	APW_ENG_20080114.0745.LDC2009T13	The bad news prompted at least one analyst to downgrade the company's stock.
9989	APW_ENG_20080114.0745.LDC2009T13	Credit Suisse analyst Gary Balter dropped his rating to "Underperform" from "Outperform" Monday, citing the company's declining real estate and brand value.

10014	APW_ENG_20080129.1460.LDC2009T13	Afghanistan risks sliding into a failed state and becoming the "forgotten war" because of deteriorating international support and a growing violent insurgency, according to an independent study.
10015	APW_ENG_20080129.1460.LDC2009T13	The assessment, co-chaired by retired U.S. Marine Corps Gen. James Jones and a former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Thomas Pickering, serves as a warning to the Bush administration at a time military and congressional officials are debating how best to juggle stretched war-fighting resources.
10016	APW_ENG_20080129.1460.LDC2009T13	The administration wants to re-energize anti-terror efforts in Afghanistan and Pakistan, where al-Qaida and the Taliban militia are regenerating.
10017	APW_ENG_20080129.1460.LDC2009T13	But the United States still remains heavily invested in Iraq, and officials are sending strong signals that troop reductions there would slow or stop altogether this summer.
10018	APW_ENG_20080129.1460.LDC2009T13	"Afghanistan stands at a crossroads," concludes the study, an advance copy of which was obtained by The Associated Press.
10019	APW_ENG_20080129.1460.LDC2009T13	"The progress achieved after six years of international engagement is under serious threat from resurgent violence, weakening international resolve, mounting regional challenges and a growing lack of confidence on the part of the Afghan people about the future direction of their country."
10020	APW_ENG_20080129.1460.LDC2009T13	A major issue has been trying to win the war with "too few military forces and insufficient economic aid," the study adds.
10021	APW_ENG_20080129.1460.LDC2009T13	Among the group's nearly three dozen recommendations: increase NATO force levels and military equipment sent to Afghanistan

10025	APW_ENG_20080129.1460.LDC2009T13	Defense Secretary Robert Gates said he was not familiar with the study's findings, but he struck a more optimistic tone on Afghanistan's future.
10026	APW_ENG_20080129.1460.LDC2009T13	"I would say that the security situation is good," Gates told The Associated Press.
10027	APW_ENG_20080129.1460.LDC2009T13	"We want to make sure it gets better, and I think there's still a need to coordinate civil reconstruction, the economic development side of it."
10028	APW_ENG_20080129.1460.LDC2009T13	Gates said more troops are needed in Afghanistan, but "certainly not ours."
10029	APW_ENG_20080129.1460.LDC2009T13	When asked how many more NATO troops might be needed, he said that number should be determined by ground commanders.
10030	APW_ENG_20080129.1460.LDC2009T13	The Jones-Pickering assessment, set for public release on Wednesday, says the United States should rethink its military and economic strategy in Afghanistan in large part because of deteriorating support among voters in NATO countries.
10031	APW_ENG_20080129.1460.LDC2009T13	If international forces are pulled, the fragile Afghan government would "likely fall apart," the report warns.
10032	APW_ENG_20080129.1460.LDC2009T13	The study was a voluntary effort coordinated by the Center for the Study of the Presidency, a nonpartisan organization in Washington, as a follow-on to the Iraq Study Group.

10056	APW_ENG_20080206.0199.LDC2009T13	Rio Tinto, which rejected an initial approach from BHP Billiton last year as too low, said it would consider the new offer, and urged its shareholders not to act hastily.
10057	APW_ENG_20080206.0199.LDC2009T13	BHP Billiton is offering 3.4 of its shares for every one Rio Tinto share, an increase from the initial informal proposal of three-for-one, the Melbourne-based company said.
10058	APW_ENG_20080206.0199.LDC2009T13	The offer applies to both companies in the Rio Tinto Group, the Australian- listed company Rio Tinto Ltd. and British-listed Rio Tinto PLC.
10059	APW_ENG_20080206.0199.LDC2009T13	BHP Billiton is already the world's largest diversified mining company, and Rio Tinto is the third-largest and analysts say that if the deal succeeds it would be the biggest takeover in the mining sector and one of the biggest ever in the corporate world.
10060	APW_ENG_20080206.0199.LDC2009T13	Steelmakers in China, Japan and Europe have protested BHP Billiton's bid for Rio Tinto, contending that a takeover would give it too much influence over global iron ore supplies and pricing.
10061	APW_ENG_20080206.0199.LDC2009T13	The deal would be subject to regulatory approvals in Australia, the United States, Europe and elsewhere, and to 50 percent shareholder approval, BHP Billiton Chief Executive Officer Marius Kloppers said.
10062	APW_ENG_20080206.0199.LDC2009T13	He said the proposed merger would deliver efficiency benefits worth US$3.7 billion (euro2.5 billion) a year and raise the value of shareholdings in both companies.
10063	APW_ENG_20080206.0199.LDC2009T13	"I believe there is widespread support for the compelling logic of the proposal to combine the companies," Kloppers told a briefing for reporters and analysts in Sydney.
10064	APW_ENG_20080206.0199.LDC2009T13	Rio Tinto Chairman Paul Skinner said the company would carefully consider BHP Billiton's latest offer, and asked shareholders not to take any action yet.
10065	APW_ENG_20080206.0199.LDC2009T13	"The boards of Rio Tinto will consider the terms of the proposal carefully in the light of all circumstances and will make a further statement once they have completed this assessment," Skinner said.
10066	APW_ENG_20080206.0199.LDC2009T13	"In the meantime, the boards encourage shareholders not to take any action."
10067	APW_ENG_20080206.0199.LDC2009T13	Rio Tinto's shares in Australia surged Wednesday, defying a broad market plunge to rise more than 2 percent to 129.91 Australian dollars.
10068	APW_ENG_20080206.0199.LDC2009T13	Shares in BHP Billiton -- which also Wednesday reported a 2.4 percent drop in net profit on-year for the six months to end-December -- fell almost 5 percent to A$37.79.
10069	APW_ENG_20080206.0199.LDC2009T13	Analysts said BHP Billiton's new offer would be more attractive to Rio Tinto than the earlier bid.
10070	APW_ENG_20080206.0199.LDC2009T13	"It's a good starting point, it should get Rio to the negotiating table," Rob Patterson, managing director of Argo Investments, told Dow Jones Newswires.
10071	APW_ENG_20080206.0199.LDC2009T13	In documents accompanying the announcement, BHP Billiton valued its latest offer at US$147.4 billion (euro100.35 billion) using its closing share prices on Monday.
10072	APW_ENG_20080206.0199.LDC2009T13	BHP Billiton also said that based on its share prices as of Oct. 31 last year, the last trading day before it first approached Rio Tinto, the deal would be worth US$173.6 billion (euro118.19 billion).
10073	APW_ENG_20080206.0199.LDC2009T13	The value of the all-share swap changes daily as the shares of BHP Billiton trade in their separate listings on Sydney and London.
10074	APW_ENG_20080206.0199.LDC2009T13	BHP Billiton's approach to Rio Tinto was complicated last week when Aluminum Corp. of China and Alcoa Inc. bought a 12 percent stake in Rio Tinto's London-listed stock, which equated to a 9 percent stake in the whole group.
10075	APW_ENG_20080206.0199.LDC2009T13	Kloppers said the development was interesting but did not affect BHP Billiton's offer.
10076	APW_ENG_20080206.0199.LDC2009T13	The purchase by Aluminum Corp. of China, known as Chinalco, and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania-based Alcoa followed rumors that some Chinese entity might try to block BHP Billiton's takeover bid for Rio Tinto.
10077	APW_ENG_20080206.0199.LDC2009T13	Chinalco President Xiao Yaqing said this week in Australia that the stake it took in Rio Tinto reflected his company's confidence in the global economic outlook and the ability of Rio Tinto's management.
10078	APW_ENG_20080206.0199.LDC2009T13	He suggested Chinalco might be prepared to sell its stake in Rio Tinto as part of a BHP bid "if the return is attractive."
10079	APW_ENG_20080206.0199.LDC2009T13	Chinalco and Alcoa have said they have no intention to raise their stake in Rio Tinto, though they reserved the right to participate in a takeover offer within the next six months.
10080	APW_ENG_20080206.0199.LDC2009T13	BHP Billiton said it had already secured a committed bank financing facility of US$55 billion (euro38 billion).
10081	APW_ENG_20080206.0199.LDC2009T13	Under the offer, Rio Tinto would hold 44 percent of the merged entity -- more than the 36 percent of the merged group BHP Billiton made in its earlier offer.
10082	APW_ENG_20080206.0199.LDC2009T13	If the offer is successful, BHP Billiton said it will return up to US$30 billion (euro20 billion) to shareholders through a share buyback within 12 months of completing the acquisition.
10083	APW_ENG_20080206.0199.LDC2009T13	Earlier Wednesday, BHP posted a net profit of US$6.02 billion (euro4.11 billion) in the six months ended Dec. 31, down 2.4 percent from a year earlier because of moderating global growth.
10084	APW_ENG_20080206.0199.LDC2009T13	The company's profit for the last half of 2006 was US$6.2 billion (euro4.23 billion).

10086	APW_ENG_20080206.0726.LDC2009T13	BUCHAREST, Romania 2008-02-06 11:39:49 UTC
10087	APW_ENG_20080206.0726.LDC2009T13	An employee of the Romanian Development Bank, which is owned by French bank Societe Generale, was arrested and accused of fraud, prosecutors said.
10088	APW_ENG_20080206.0726.LDC2009T13	Prosecutors said they arrested Mihaela Rosana Bitu, a teller at the Romanian Development Bank in the city of Craiova, in southern Romania on Tuesday.
10089	APW_ENG_20080206.0726.LDC2009T13	Bitu is accused of using the password of the branch's director and illegally transferring euro2.2 million (about US$3.2 million) into two bank accounts.
10090	APW_ENG_20080206.0726.LDC2009T13	Romanian authorities have arrested three other people and prosecutors said Wednesday that a total of seven people were under investigation.
10091	APW_ENG_20080206.0726.LDC2009T13	Bitu was being held in jail and it was not immediately clear when she would appear in court.
10092	APW_ENG_20080206.0726.LDC2009T13	The representatives of the bank said that they managed to recover euro1.9 million (about US$2.8 million).
10093	APW_ENG_20080206.0726.LDC2009T13	Adela Jansen, the secretary-general of the Romanian Development Bank Societe Generale, said that "in less than two hours, the bank had managed to block most of the sum."
10094	APW_ENG_20080206.0726.LDC2009T13	Last month, Societe Generale reported losing euro4.82 billion (US$7.09 billion) because of a rogue trader.

10096	APW_ENG_20080207.1075.LDC2009T13	NAIROBI, Kenya 2008-02-07 17:19:16 UTC
10097	APW_ENG_20080207.1075.LDC2009T13	The U.S. said Thursday it was threatening to bar 10 leading Kenyan politicians and businessmen -- with ties to both the president's party and his rival's -- from entering the United States, as international pressure mounted on talks to resolve the political crisis over disputed elections and to end violence.
10098	APW_ENG_20080207.1075.LDC2009T13	President Mwai Kibaki's Party of National Unity and the opposition Orange Democratic Movement denied being behind the clashes, looting and arson that have caused more than 1,000 deaths and forced 300,000 Kenyans from their homes.
10099	APW_ENG_20080207.1075.LDC2009T13	The U.S. announcement -- the first time Washington has blamed leading politicians for the violence -- came as pressure mounted on negotiators from the rival parties to come to terms in peace talks mediated by former U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
10100	APW_ENG_20080207.1075.LDC2009T13	Opposition leaders say Kibaki stole a Dec. 27 vote and should step down.
10101	APW_ENG_20080207.1075.LDC2009T13	Kibaki has said his position as president is not negotiable, though foreign and local observers say there was election rigging.
10102	APW_ENG_20080207.1075.LDC2009T13	Clashes sparked by the dispute disintegrated into ethnic fighting pitting other tribes against Kibaki's Kikuyu.
10103	APW_ENG_20080207.1075.LDC2009T13	U.S. Embassy spokesman T.J. Dowling said lawmakers from both parties were advised they would not be allowed into the United States because they had been involved in or incited violence.
10104	APW_ENG_20080207.1075.LDC2009T13	"We don't give visas to criminals," Dowling told The Associated Press.
10105	APW_ENG_20080207.1075.LDC2009T13	"Inciting violence is a criminal act."
10106	APW_ENG_20080207.1075.LDC2009T13	Ambassador Michael Ranneberger told foreign journalists that letters had been sent to the politicians and businessmen and their families threatening a ban, which had not yet been imposed.
10107	APW_ENG_20080207.1075.LDC2009T13	"What we have said is that people involved in inciting, supporting or perpetrating violence must be held accountable and, for our part, as the United States of America, we will hold them accountable by not providing visas," Ranneberger said.
10108	APW_ENG_20080207.1075.LDC2009T13	Britain said it could take similar steps.
10109	APW_ENG_20080207.1075.LDC2009T13	"We have in the past excluded Kenyan politicians and businessmen on the grounds of corruption.
10110	APW_ENG_20080207.1075.LDC2009T13	We have the ability to do so and nothing has been ruled out," a British Foreign Office spokesperson said on condition of anonymity, in keeping with the ministry's regulations.
10111	APW_ENG_20080207.1075.LDC2009T13	A Canadian official also said his country was applying similar visa restrictions.
10112	APW_ENG_20080207.1075.LDC2009T13	The Standard daily on Thursday quoted Canadian High Commissioner Ross Hynes as saying that Canada wanted to pass "a strong message to the politicians that the ban is real and will happen."
10113	APW_ENG_20080207.1075.LDC2009T13	In a statement, Kibaki's government welcomed the U.S. and Canadian decisions "to bar people who participated in ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity during the post election period."
10114	APW_ENG_20080207.1075.LDC2009T13	But his party denied any involvement.
10115	APW_ENG_20080207.1075.LDC2009T13	Albert Muiruri, from Kibaki's party, said, "I can't think of one PNU member of Parliament or top official who was involved in or incited violence."
10116	APW_ENG_20080207.1075.LDC2009T13	The opposition also said their politicians were not involved.
10117	APW_ENG_20080207.1075.LDC2009T13	"We categorically deny that any ODM leader was behind any kind of violence anywhere in the country," party spokesman Ahmed Hashi said.
10118	APW_ENG_20080207.1075.LDC2009T13	Foreign observers have reported evidence of orchestrated violence and accused both sides of fomenting clashes.
10119	APW_ENG_20080207.1075.LDC2009T13	Visiting delegations urged the parties Thursday to reach agreement in the talks that began Jan. 29.
10120	APW_ENG_20080207.1075.LDC2009T13	EU Development Commissioner Louis Michel, who met with Kibaki and his rival in the election, Raila Odinga, said the European Union expects that "a consensus would be reached on all issues, including addressing the underlying causes of the postelection violence."
10121	APW_ENG_20080207.1075.LDC2009T13	Michel urged the rivals to compromise.
10122	APW_ENG_20080207.1075.LDC2009T13	"There are strong signals of flexibility and open-minded attitude that gives me a little more optimistic perspective for the future of Kenya," He told reporters.
10123	APW_ENG_20080207.1075.LDC2009T13	"All sides have to make efforts.
10124	APW_ENG_20080207.1075.LDC2009T13	There is a price for agreement."
10125	APW_ENG_20080207.1075.LDC2009T13	Earlier this week, Annan warned that political issues in the talks would be tough.
10126	APW_ENG_20080207.1075.LDC2009T13	"The topic is a crucial one, proving divisive at times, but the talks proceeded in a good spirit," his office said in a statement about Thursday's talks.
10127	APW_ENG_20080207.1075.LDC2009T13	"They are moving more slowly than in previous sessions but are moving steadily ahead."
10128	APW_ENG_20080207.1075.LDC2009T13	Between meetings Thursday, foreign ministers from the East African IGAD bloc met with the three-member panel of negotiators "to express solidarity with the people of Kenya and the work of the panel."
10129	APW_ENG_20080207.1075.LDC2009T13	Opposition leader Odinga also signaled some optimism, telling reporters that the negotiations provided "an opportunity to deal with issues that had been under the carpet for too long, so that we can find a sustainable solution for our country."
10130	APW_ENG_20080207.1075.LDC2009T13	A U.N. fact-finding mission, sent by the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Louise Arbour, was in Kenya to assess allegations of grave human rights violations during the fighting, and a top U.N. relief agency official was to arrive Friday to assess the humanitarian situation.
10131	APW_ENG_20080207.1075.LDC2009T13	John Holmes, from the humanitarian affairs and emergency relief department would also meet government and opposition leaders, the U.N. said.
10132	APW_ENG_20080207.1075.LDC2009T13	Heads of state from five East African countries are also expected in Nairobi to hold a special summit to support Annan's peace process.
10133	APW_ENG_20080207.1075.LDC2009T13	The U.N. Security Council has deplored the violence and urged political leaders to resolve the crisis "through dialogue, negotiation and compromise."
10134	APW_ENG_20080207.1075.LDC2009T13	It expressed concern at the "dire humanitarian situation" in the country and gave strong backing to the Annan-led talks that began Jan. 29, in a statement released in New York.
10135	APW_ENG_20080207.1075.LDC2009T13	Last month, the top U.S. diplomat for Africa said she saw the violence as ethnic cleansing, but the State Department backed away from her statement, saying the U.S. had not yet concluded whether atrocities had been committed.
10136	APW_ENG_20080207.1075.LDC2009T13	Fighting has continued in western Kenya, scene of some of the worst postelection clashes.
10137	APW_ENG_20080207.1075.LDC2009T13	On Thursday, police said an officer accused of killing two demonstrators last month in Kisumu, western Kenya, will be charged with murder.

10141	APW_ENG_20080208.0306.LDC2009T13	WASHINGTON 2008-02-08 05:25:59 UTC
10142	APW_ENG_20080208.0306.LDC2009T13	It's almost as if Americans can barely stand the thought of President George W. Bush and Congress anymore.
10143	APW_ENG_20080208.0306.LDC2009T13	Bush reached his lowest approval rating in The Associated Press- Ipsos poll on Friday, as only 30 percent said they like the job he is doing, including an all-time low in his support by Republicans.
10144	APW_ENG_20080208.0306.LDC2009T13	Congress' approval fell to just 22 percent, equaling its poorest grade in the survey.
10145	APW_ENG_20080208.0306.LDC2009T13	Both marks dropped by 4 percentage points since early January.
10146	APW_ENG_20080208.0306.LDC2009T13	The dour public mood seems to chiefly reflect distress over the doddering economy, which has seen job cuts, financial market slides and real estate losses stoke recession fears.
10147	APW_ENG_20080208.0306.LDC2009T13	Bush's approval for handling the economy dove to 29 percent, a slide of 4 percentage points in a month and matching his low on that issue, with noticeable slumps among middle-income people, Southerners and city residents.
10148	APW_ENG_20080208.0306.LDC2009T13	"He's spent billions of dollars on the war, and the economy here is suffering," said Ron Brathwaite, 41, a Democrat from New York who was interviewed in the poll.
10149	APW_ENG_20080208.0306.LDC2009T13	"If you're leading this country, you should start fixing within this country."
10150	APW_ENG_20080208.0306.LDC2009T13	Bush and Congress have been overshadowed in recent months by a presidential campaign in which both parties' candidates have emphasized how they would change Washington -- an implicit criticism of the president and the Democratic-led Congress.
10151	APW_ENG_20080208.0306.LDC2009T13	Even the leading Republican contenders have spent little time defending Bush, though they haven't attacked him frequently because he remains popular with some in the Republican Party.
10152	APW_ENG_20080208.0306.LDC2009T13	Yet Bush's acceptance by his own party is at bottom in the AP- Ipsos poll.
10153	APW_ENG_20080208.0306.LDC2009T13	Just 61 percent of Republicans gave Bush positive reviews
10154	APW_ENG_20080208.0306.LDC2009T13	his previous low was 65 percent last month.
10155	APW_ENG_20080208.0306.LDC2009T13	Only 28 percent of them expressed strong approval.
10156	APW_ENG_20080208.0306.LDC2009T13	About one in 10 Democrats and three in 10 independents gave Bush positive marks.
10157	APW_ENG_20080208.0306.LDC2009T13	"I believe we have to protect the country at all costs," said Jack Vogt, 61, a retiree from Lakeland, Florida, and a strong Bush supporter.
10158	APW_ENG_20080208.0306.LDC2009T13	He said he did not fault the president or Congress for the economy's problems, saying, "I don't feel they can influence it one way or the other."
10159	APW_ENG_20080208.0306.LDC2009T13	Bush's previous overall low in the AP-Ipsos poll came in November when his approval rating was 31 percent.
10160	APW_ENG_20080208.0306.LDC2009T13	His current level is essentially even with that.
10161	APW_ENG_20080208.0306.LDC2009T13	Congress also hit 22 percent in October.
10162	APW_ENG_20080208.0306.LDC2009T13	It usually has lower ratings than the president because it is an institution people love to criticize.
10163	APW_ENG_20080208.0306.LDC2009T13	Many have negative views of Congress while still supporting their own House and Senate members.
10164	APW_ENG_20080208.0306.LDC2009T13	Even so, its ratings are approaching its historic low in the Gallup Poll of 18 percent reached in early 1992 during a furor over lawmakers who bounced House bank checks.
10165	APW_ENG_20080208.0306.LDC2009T13	Only about one in five Democrats, Republicans and independents approve of Congress' work, with less than one in 20 from each group approving strongly.
10166	APW_ENG_20080208.0306.LDC2009T13	Bush also hit a new low in this month's poll for his work on domestic issues like health care, energy and the environment, getting approval from 27 percent, a 7-point tumble since January.
10167	APW_ENG_20080208.0306.LDC2009T13	Thirty-three percent approved of his handling of the war in Iraq, virtually unchanged.
10168	APW_ENG_20080208.0306.LDC2009T13	Underlining the public gloom, after a brief holiday uptick, the mood of the country has returned to its level in November, with just 25 percent saying the country is headed in the right direction.
10169	APW_ENG_20080208.0306.LDC2009T13	President Harry Truman had the lowest rating ever in the Gallup Poll with 23 percent approval in 1952 during the Korean War

10272	APW_ENG_20080308.0234.LDC2009T13	WASHINGTON 2008-03-08 06:17:32 UTC
10273	APW_ENG_20080308.0234.LDC2009T13	President George W. Bush is poised to veto legislation that would bar the CIA from using waterboarding -- a technique that simulates drowning -- and other harsh interrogation methods on terror suspects.
10274	APW_ENG_20080308.0234.LDC2009T13	The president planned to talk about the veto in his Saturday radio address.
10275	APW_ENG_20080308.0234.LDC2009T13	Bush has said the bill would harm the government's ability to prevent future attacks.
10276	APW_ENG_20080308.0234.LDC2009T13	Supporters of the legislation argue that it preserves the United States' right to collect critical intelligence while boosting the country's moral standing abroad.
10277	APW_ENG_20080308.0234.LDC2009T13	"The bill would take away one of the most valuable tools on the war on terror, the CIA program to detain and question key terrorist leaders and operatives," deputy White House press secretary Tony Fratto said Friday.
10278	APW_ENG_20080308.0234.LDC2009T13	The bill would restrict the CIA to using only the 19 interrogation techniques listed in the Army field manual.
10279	APW_ENG_20080308.0234.LDC2009T13	The legislation would bar the CIA from using waterboarding, sensory deprivation or other coercive methods to break a prisoner who refuses to answer questions.
10280	APW_ENG_20080308.0234.LDC2009T13	Those practices were banned by the military in 2006, but the president wants the harsh interrogation methods to be a part of the CIA's toolbox.
10281	APW_ENG_20080308.0234.LDC2009T13	Backers of the legislation, which cleared the House in December and won Senate approval last month, say the interrogation methods used by the military are sufficient.
10282	APW_ENG_20080308.0234.LDC2009T13	"President Bush's veto will be one of the most shameful acts of his presidency," Democratic Sen. Edward Kennedy said in a statement Friday.
10283	APW_ENG_20080308.0234.LDC2009T13	"Unless Congress overrides the veto, it will go down in history as a flagrant insult to the rule of law and a serious stain on the good name of America in the eyes of the world."
10284	APW_ENG_20080308.0234.LDC2009T13	He noted that the Army field manual contends that harsh interrogation is a "poor technique that yields unreliable results, may damage subsequent collection efforts, and can induce the source to say what he thinks the (interrogator) wants to hear."

10302	APW_ENG_20080314.1686.LDC2009T13	Britain's prestigious Eton College confirmed Friday it was holding an inquiry after newspapers reported four pupils were suspended over the alleged mugging of a 13-year-old girl on its playing fields.
10303	APW_ENG_20080314.1686.LDC2009T13	The girl reportedly claimed her handbag had been stolen and she had broken at least one rib in the incident at the elite school, whose former pupils include Princes William and Harry and 18 British prime ministers.
10304	APW_ENG_20080314.1686.LDC2009T13	One of the four boys, all aged 13 and 14, is believed to have dropped his trousers in front of the girl, according to The Times newspaper.
10305	APW_ENG_20080314.1686.LDC2009T13	One of the boys was said to be the grandson of a British politician.
10306	APW_ENG_20080314.1686.LDC2009T13	Eton College, founded in 1440 by King Henry VI, is home for 1,300 boys between the ages of 13 and 18 who all board at the school, some 25 miles (40 kilometers) west of London.

10309	APW_ENG_20080314.1686.LDC2009T13	The incident has not been reported to police, a police spokesman said Friday.
10310	APW_ENG_20080314.1686.LDC2009T13	"I understand it is being dealt with by Eton College," the spokesman, who was not named in line with force policy.
10311	APW_ENG_20080314.1686.LDC2009T13	"If a complaint is made it will be investigated thoroughly."
10312	APW_ENG_20080314.1686.LDC2009T13	The school said Friday it had begun an investigation to find out what had happened.
10313	APW_ENG_20080314.1686.LDC2009T13	"When we are sure, we shall take whatever disciplinary action is justified.
10314	APW_ENG_20080314.1686.LDC2009T13	Like other schools we do not comment in detail on matters affecting individual pupils," the school said in an e-mailed statement.

10351	APW_ENG_20080324.0919.LDC2009T13	Al-Qaida No. 2 calls on Muslims to strike US, Jewish interests to avenge Gaza violence
10352	APW_ENG_20080324.0919.LDC2009T13	CAIRO, Egypt 2008-03-24 18:23:26 UTC
10353	APW_ENG_20080324.0919.LDC2009T13	Al-Qaida No. 2 Ayman al-Zawahri called on Muslims to strike Jewish and American targets anywhere in the world in revenge for Israel's offensive in the Gaza Strip in an audiotape Monday, part of a new push by the terror network to use anger over the violence to rally support.
10354	APW_ENG_20080324.0919.LDC2009T13	The al-Zawahri tape came just days after two messages from Osama bin Laden, who called for a holy war to liberate the Palestinian territories and warned of a "severe" reaction against Europe over the recent publishing of cartoons seen as insulting Islam's Prophet Muhammad in Danish newspapers.
10355	APW_ENG_20080324.0919.LDC2009T13	The string of messages has raised fears al-Qaida could be planning new attacks against Israel or in the West -- or is seeking to inspire its sympathizers to carry out violence.
10356	APW_ENG_20080324.0919.LDC2009T13	In another message last week, bin Laden warned of a "severe" reaction against Europe after Danish papers published a cartoon seen as insulting Islam's Prophet Muhammad.
10357	APW_ENG_20080324.0919.LDC2009T13	But the new tapes may have another broader goal -- to show supporters and the West that it can extend its operations and open a new front against Israel.
10358	APW_ENG_20080324.0919.LDC2009T13	Bin Laden and al-Zawahri have frequently referred to the Palestinian cause in their past messages, usually in broader terms of liberating Jerusalem and denouncing Israeli violence.
10359	APW_ENG_20080324.0919.LDC2009T13	But al-Qaida is not known to have a direct presence in Israel or the Palestinian territories, though Israeli and Palestinian officials have at times warned it is seeking to.
10360	APW_ENG_20080324.0919.LDC2009T13	Al-Qaida sympathizers have often posted messages on Islamic militant Web forums asking why the terror network has not attacked Israel on its soil or gotten more involved on the Palestinian front.
10361	APW_ENG_20080324.0919.LDC2009T13	Bruce Hoffman, a counterterrorism expert, said that with al-Qaida in Iraq suffering setbacks, al-Qaida "has to look further afield and at least give an impression of an upward trajectory, that its operating across the Middle East."
10362	APW_ENG_20080324.0919.LDC2009T13	He pointed out that Al-Qaida's media arm, Al-Sahab, has dramatically stepped up its output of audio and video tapes, issuing an average of one every three days in 2007, more than double the 2006 rate.
10363	APW_ENG_20080324.0919.LDC2009T13	"There comes a time when you have to back up your words," said Hoffman, a professor at Washington's Georgetown University.
10364	APW_ENG_20080324.0919.LDC2009T13	"With the increased drumbeat of propoaganda ... it becomes an element of necessity, if you're talking so much you have to do something."
10365	APW_ENG_20080324.0919.LDC2009T13	"Perhaps they don't have the ability to attack the United States, so they may turn to the next best enemy, either Israel or Europe," he said.
10366	APW_ENG_20080324.0919.LDC2009T13	Al-Zawahri's call for attacks had a more immediate and urgent tone than past messages -- and he said attacks should not be limited to Israeli or Palestinian territory.
10367	APW_ENG_20080324.0919.LDC2009T13	"Muslims, today is your day.
10368	APW_ENG_20080324.0919.LDC2009T13	Strike the interests of the Jews, the Americans, and all those who participated in the attack on Muslims," al-Zawahri said in the 4 minute, 44-second audiotape.
10369	APW_ENG_20080324.0919.LDC2009T13	"Monitor the targets, collect money, prepare the equipment, plan with precision, and then -- while relying on God -- assault, seeking martyrdom and paradise."
10370	APW_ENG_20080324.0919.LDC2009T13	"Today there is no room for he who says that we should only fight the Jews in Palestine," he said.
10371	APW_ENG_20080324.0919.LDC2009T13	"Let us strike their interests everywhere, just like they gathered against us from everywhere."
10372	APW_ENG_20080324.0919.LDC2009T13	"Let them know that they will get blood for every dollar they spend in the killing of the Muslims, and for every bullet they fire at us, a volcano will turn back on them," he said, referring to American military aid and other ties to Israel.
10373	APW_ENG_20080324.0919.LDC2009T13	"They cannot expect to support Israel, then live in peace while the Jews are killing our fugitive and besieged people."
10374	APW_ENG_20080324.0919.LDC2009T13	The authenticity of Monday's tape could not be independently confirmed.
10375	APW_ENG_20080324.0919.LDC2009T13	But the voice on it resembled that of al-Zawahri on previous audio and videotapes confirmed to be his.
10376	APW_ENG_20080324.0919.LDC2009T13	It was posted on an Islamic militant Web site where al-Qaida usually releases its statements, and a banner advertising the tape had the logo of Al-Sahab.
10377	APW_ENG_20080324.0919.LDC2009T13	Israeli officials declined to comment on the new tape.
10378	APW_ENG_20080324.0919.LDC2009T13	Israel launched a weeklong offensive in Gaza that ended in early March, seeking to put down Palestinian militants firing rockets against nearby Israeli towns.
10379	APW_ENG_20080324.0919.LDC2009T13	The Israeli assault killed more than 120 people, including many civilians, and caused heavy damage -- all aired prominently on Arab satellite TV news networks.
10380	APW_ENG_20080324.0919.LDC2009T13	The only previous attack blamed on al-Qaida specifically targeting Israelis was a 2002 suicide bombing of a hotel full of Israelis in Mombasa, Kenya that killed 16 people and a simultaneous failed attempt to shoot down an Israeli passenger plane taking off from the city with rockets.
10381	APW_ENG_20080324.0919.LDC2009T13	Al-Zawahri also denounced Arab leaders he accused of supporting Israel -- pointing to Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Jordan, suggesting they too could be targets.
10382	APW_ENG_20080324.0919.LDC2009T13	The Egyptian-born al-Zawahri accused Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak of colluding with Israel in the siege of Gaza.
10383	APW_ENG_20080324.0919.LDC2009T13	Egypt has sealed its border with the Gaza Strip since the Palestinian militant group Hamas took over the territory last year.
10384	APW_ENG_20080324.0919.LDC2009T13	He said Mubarak "repeats the same dirty role" as the Lebanese Phalangists -- a Christian militia that was allied with Israel in Lebanon's 1975-1990 civil war and was blamed in the massacre of Palestinian refugees in the Beirut camps of Sabra and Shatila.
10385	APW_ENG_20080324.0919.LDC2009T13	"The roles are the same, even if the faces change -- the same betrayal even if the names have changed," said al-Zawahri.

10387	APW_ENG_20080326.0843.LDC2009T13	WASHINGTON 2008-03-26 15:07:23 UTC
10388	APW_ENG_20080326.0843.LDC2009T13	Wrapping up a series of consultations on Iraq, President Bush met at the Defense Department on Wednesday with the military's top leaders to hear their views on prospects for further U.S. troop reductions.
10389	APW_ENG_20080326.0843.LDC2009T13	Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman said the president planned to spend about two hours in a closed session with the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the top U.S. military advisory group.
10390	APW_ENG_20080326.0843.LDC2009T13	Bush was accompanied by his chief of staff, Joshua Bolten
10391	APW_ENG_20080326.0843.LDC2009T13	his national security adviser, Stephen Hadley, and Vice President Dick Cheney.
10392	APW_ENG_20080326.0843.LDC2009T13	The session was to be led by Navy Adm. Michael Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs.
10393	APW_ENG_20080326.0843.LDC2009T13	He was presenting the consensus view of the chiefs of the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marine Corps on Iraq strategy.
10394	APW_ENG_20080326.0843.LDC2009T13	"This is their opportunity to make (known) their views on Iraq and the way ahead," Whitman said.
10395	APW_ENG_20080326.0843.LDC2009T13	It was the last in a series of Iraq consultations by Bush with his top advisers and commanders in advance of a decision by Bush on how to proceed in Iraq as U.S. troops levels are declining.
10396	APW_ENG_20080326.0843.LDC2009T13	On Monday Bush heard from Adm. William J. Fallon, the U.S. Central Command chief who is relinquishing his command on Friday, and from Gen. David Petraeus, the top commander in Iraq.
10397	APW_ENG_20080326.0843.LDC2009T13	Bush heard on Tuesday from Defense Secretary Robert Gates.
10398	APW_ENG_20080326.0843.LDC2009T13	After Petraeus presents his Iraq progress report to Congress in early April, Bush is expected to embrace the field commander's desire for a temporary halt in troop withdrawals beyond those already scheduled.
10399	APW_ENG_20080326.0843.LDC2009T13	There are now 156,000 U.S. troops in Iraq.
10400	APW_ENG_20080326.0843.LDC2009T13	That number is scheduled to drop to about 140,000 by the end of July.
10401	APW_ENG_20080326.0843.LDC2009T13	Petraeus, with support from Gates, has said he would like to halt the reductions at that point for a period of "consolidation and evaluation" before resuming troop reductions.
10402	APW_ENG_20080326.0843.LDC2009T13	The president is collecting advice from military leaders at a time of turmoil in Iraq, where fighting has flared in recent days in Baghdad as well as the southern oil port city of Basra.
10403	APW_ENG_20080326.0843.LDC2009T13	Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki was in Basra to supervise a crackdown against the spiraling violence between militia factions vying for control of the center of the country's vast oil industry located near the Iranian border.
10404	APW_ENG_20080326.0843.LDC2009T13	The violence has raised fears that the cease-fire declared in August by Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr could unravel, presenting the gravest challenge to the Iraqi government in months.
10405	APW_ENG_20080326.0843.LDC2009T13	At Wednesday's session at the Pentagon, the military leaders were expected to tell Bush how a bigger and quicker U.S. troop reduction could help maintain the health of the entire U.S. armed forces.
10406	APW_ENG_20080326.0843.LDC2009T13	The president may also hear Gen. George Casey, the Army chief of staff, explain his desire to reduce soldiers' tour lengths in Iraq from 15 months to 12 months.
10407	APW_ENG_20080326.0843.LDC2009T13	The president is due to give a speech Thursday on the political and economic situation in Iraq.
10408	APW_ENG_20080326.0843.LDC2009T13	That would be a follow-up to his speech last week focusing on recent security gains in the war.

10410	APW_ENG_20080401.1042.LDC2009T13	WASHINGTON 2008-04-01 16:39:45 UTC
10411	APW_ENG_20080401.1042.LDC2009T13	The U.S. House of Representatives plans to consider by early May legislation that would continue paying for the Iraq war, Majority Leader Steny Hoyer told reporters on Tuesday.
10412	APW_ENG_20080401.1042.LDC2009T13	The legislation will come after Gen. David Petraeus, the top military commander in Iraq, and Ryan Crocker, the U.S. ambassador there, testify on April 8 and April 9.
10413	APW_ENG_20080401.1042.LDC2009T13	The two officials are expected to tell Congress that impressive security gains and modest political progress has been made since last year's influx of U.S. troops, and that troop withdrawals can continue later this year only after officials ascertain it would not hurt security.
10414	APW_ENG_20080401.1042.LDC2009T13	Democrats are expected to challenge their recommendation that troops should stay, contending that the Iraqis are not doing enough to hasten progress so long as the U.S. is leading combat operations.
10415	APW_ENG_20080401.1042.LDC2009T13	They have held off on approving all the money President George W. Bush wants for the war this year.
10416	APW_ENG_20080401.1042.LDC2009T13	Congress has approved about $86.7 billion (euro55.3 billion), leaving the military about $102.5 (euro65.4) billion short of its request for the 2008 budget year, which began Oct. 1.
10417	APW_ENG_20080401.1042.LDC2009T13	It is likely party members will again try to tie the money needed by the military to demands that troops start coming home.
10418	APW_ENG_20080401.1042.LDC2009T13	If so, the debate would become a rehash of last year, when Democrats repeatedly insisted on anti-war language only to back down after falling short of the votes needed to overcome procedural hurdles in the Senate.
10419	APW_ENG_20080401.1042.LDC2009T13	Hoyer, a Democrat, questions whether using money to force troop withdrawals is the best approach.
10420	APW_ENG_20080401.1042.LDC2009T13	"I think policy needs to be changed," but as long as troops are deployed "those troops need to be supported," he said.
10421	APW_ENG_20080401.1042.LDC2009T13	There are now 158,000 U.S. troops in Iraq.
10422	APW_ENG_20080401.1042.LDC2009T13	By the end of July that number is supposed to fall to 140,000.
10423	APW_ENG_20080401.1042.LDC2009T13	Whether additional troops are withdrawn after July is one of the questions that Petraeus is expected to address in his testimony

10428	APW_ENG_20080402.1346.LDC2009T13	Leftist President Rafael Correa, whose party controls the 130-member assembly writing the new constitution, has repeatedly said that he will not renew the 10-year U.S. lease in Ecuador's Pacific port of Manta when it expires in late 2009.
10429	APW_ENG_20080402.1346.LDC2009T13	The measure approved Tuesday states that "Ecuador is a land of peace," and that "the presence of foreign military bases or foreign installations with military purposes is prohibited."
10430	APW_ENG_20080402.1346.LDC2009T13	The U.S. is the only foreign country with a military base in Ecuador.
10431	APW_ENG_20080402.1346.LDC2009T13	The surveillance flights the United States runs out of the base are responsible for much of the anti-narcotics effort for the eastern Pacific.

10461	APW_ENG_20080409.0590.LDC2009T13	Hundreds of people protesting an assault on a former Cabinet minister and close supporter of President Pervez Musharraf blocked roads and burned tires in his hometown Wednesday, police said.
10462	APW_ENG_20080409.0590.LDC2009T13	About 300 people gathered at a busy intersection in Mianwali, setting tires ablaze and blocking traffic to condemn the Tuesday attack on former parliamentary affairs minister Sher Afgan Niazi, said Abdur Razzaq, a Mianwali police officer.
10463	APW_ENG_20080409.0590.LDC2009T13	Niazi was not seriously hurt in the attack in the provincial capital of Lahore after a mob of attorneys and others besieged him in an office for several hours.
10464	APW_ENG_20080409.0590.LDC2009T13	Aitzaz Ahsan, a prominent anti-Musharraf lawyer and president of the Supreme Court Bar Association, tried in vain to disperse the crowd and rescue Niazi.
10465	APW_ENG_20080409.0590.LDC2009T13	Ahsan announced later that he was resigning as Supreme Court Bar Association president in protest.
10466	APW_ENG_20080409.0590.LDC2009T13	The trouble began when irate protesters, including black-suited lawyers, jostled Niazi and tried to beat him with their hands and shoes when he emerged.

10470	APW_ENG_20080409.0590.LDC2009T13	In an overnight protest against lawyers, dozens of Niazi's supporters set several rooms on fire at the Mianwali courts, Razzaq said.
10471	APW_ENG_20080409.0590.LDC2009T13	No injuries were reported.
10472	APW_ENG_20080409.0590.LDC2009T13	Authorities were holding talks with protest leaders to keep things from getting out of control, he said.

10475	APW_ENG_20080409.0590.LDC2009T13	Niazi called for calm.

10477	APW_ENG_20080409.0590.LDC2009T13	Be peaceful," he said on Express News TV.
10478	APW_ENG_20080409.0590.LDC2009T13	The attack on Niazi came a day after another close Musharraf associate, the outgoing chief minister of neighboring Sindh province, was beaten with a shoe and heckled in the provincial legislature.
10479	APW_ENG_20080409.0590.LDC2009T13	Musharraf and new Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani strongly condemned the two attacks, issuing a joint statement saying such "hooliganism" was designed to undercut political cooperation.

10495	APW_ENG_20080409.0933.LDC2009T13	DALLAS (AP) -- American Airlines canceled 850 flights Wednesday -- more than one-third of its schedule -- as it spent a second straight day inspecting the wiring on some of its jets, the same issue that caused the nation's biggest airline to scrub hundreds of flights two weeks ago.
10496	APW_ENG_20080409.0933.LDC2009T13	American canceled nearly 500 flights on Tuesday, stranding hundreds of passengers.
10497	APW_ENG_20080409.0933.LDC2009T13	Federal inspectors found problems with wiring work done two weeks ago, although the airline says safety was never jeopardized.
10498	APW_ENG_20080409.0933.LDC2009T13	Tim Wagner, a spokesman for American, said cancellations could continue beyond Wednesday as the airline works on its MD-80 jets.
10499	APW_ENG_20080409.0933.LDC2009T13	American uses the MD-80s mostly on mid-range flights, particularly from hub airports in Dallas and Chicago.
10500	APW_ENG_20080409.0933.LDC2009T13	Wagner said 208 of Wednesday's cancellations would occur at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport and 138 at Chicago O'Hare.
10501	APW_ENG_20080409.0933.LDC2009T13	At New York's LaGuardia Airport, hundreds of passengers stood in a check-in line.
10502	APW_ENG_20080409.0933.LDC2009T13	The airline offered free doughnuts, coffee and orange juice, but there were few takers.
10503	APW_ENG_20080409.0933.LDC2009T13	Bishop Bernard Jordan, a Harlem minister, was in a first-class line trying to catch a flight to Atlanta, where he was scheduled to preach Wednesday night.
10504	APW_ENG_20080409.0933.LDC2009T13	"It would have been good to know in advance," said Jordan, who said he has 4 million frequent-flier miles with American and flies to Atlanta every other week.
10505	APW_ENG_20080409.0933.LDC2009T13	"I would have booked with another airline."
10506	APW_ENG_20080409.0933.LDC2009T13	The Fort Worth-based airline said it would put displaced travelers on other American flights or those operated by competitors.
10507	APW_ENG_20080409.0933.LDC2009T13	Wagner said that because the delays were "within our control" and not weather-related, American was offering meals, lodging and ground transportation to affected travelers.
10508	APW_ENG_20080409.0933.LDC2009T13	American operates about 2,300 daily flights, more than one-third with MD-80s.
10509	APW_ENG_20080409.0933.LDC2009T13	It was American's second bout with mass cancellations in less than two weeks for failing to meet the same wiring rules set by the Federal Aviation Administration, which is cracking down on airlines after admitting its inspectors were too lax last year with Southwest Airlines Co.
10510	APW_ENG_20080409.0933.LDC2009T13	Since the FAA began looking more closely at airlines' compliance with safety directives, there have been cancellations at Southwest, Delta Air Lines Inc. and UAL Corp.'s United Airlines.
10511	APW_ENG_20080409.0933.LDC2009T13	The agency levied a $10.2 million civil penalty against Southwest for using planes that had missed inspections for cracks in the fuselage.
10512	APW_ENG_20080409.0933.LDC2009T13	Wagner said an FAA inspector checked several MD-80s Monday and found that some of the wiring work performed two weeks ago did not meet FAA standards.
10513	APW_ENG_20080409.0933.LDC2009T13	At issue: the spacing and direction of cords used to secure bundles of wires in the planes' auxiliary hydraulic systems.
10514	APW_ENG_20080409.0933.LDC2009T13	The airline said flight safety was never compromised, but, beginning around midafternoon Tuesday, American began yanking planes out of service so that wiring bundles could be inspected and stowed properly in the wheel wells.
10515	APW_ENG_20080409.0933.LDC2009T13	Gerard Arpey, the chief executive of American and its parent, AMR Corp., apologized for the inconvenience and said the airline was working to comply with FAA orders.
10516	APW_ENG_20080409.0933.LDC2009T13	The cancellations and resulting loss of revenue could hardly come at a worse time for American, which is facing high fuel prices and a weakening economy that could hurt demand for travel.
10517	APW_ENG_20080409.0933.LDC2009T13	AMR is scheduled to report first-quarter earnings in two weeks, and analysts are forecasting a loss of more than $300 million, according to a survey by Thomson Financial.
10518	APW_ENG_20080409.0933.LDC2009T13	Jamie Baker, an analyst with JPMorgan, said in a recent note to clients that he expects airline revenue to decline significantly beginning in the April-June second quarter due to the one-two punch of costly fuel and a possible recession.

10528	APW_ENG_20080416.1203.LDC2009T13	2008-04-16 18:17:25 UTC
10529	APW_ENG_20080416.1203.LDC2009T13	The U.S. Open figured to be the closest to a sure thing for Tiger Woods in the majors this year, but maybe not anymore.
10530	APW_ENG_20080416.1203.LDC2009T13	Two days after his quest for a Grand Slam fizzled at the Masters, Woods had arthroscopic surgery on his left knee for the second time in five years and will miss at least four weeks while he recovers.
10531	APW_ENG_20080416.1203.LDC2009T13	The announcement, which Woods made Tuesday night on his Web site, was a surprise to everyone except those around him.
10532	APW_ENG_20080416.1203.LDC2009T13	"He's been having a lot of trouble," swing coach Hank Haney said.
10533	APW_ENG_20080416.1203.LDC2009T13	"He doesn't talk about stuff like that.
10534	APW_ENG_20080416.1203.LDC2009T13	He doesn't want to use excuses, you know?
10535	APW_ENG_20080416.1203.LDC2009T13	I don't think it affected his play.
10536	APW_ENG_20080416.1203.LDC2009T13	It affected his practice a little bit."
10537	APW_ENG_20080416.1203.LDC2009T13	The surgery was performed in Park City, Utah, by Thomas Rosenberg, who also operated on Woods' left knee in December 2002.
10538	APW_ENG_20080416.1203.LDC2009T13	Woods also had surgery in 1994 on his left knee to remove a benign tumor.
10539	APW_ENG_20080416.1203.LDC2009T13	"I made the decision to deal with the pain and schedule the surgery for after the Masters," Woods said on his Web site.
10540	APW_ENG_20080416.1203.LDC2009T13	"The upside is that I have been through this process before and know how to handle it.
10541	APW_ENG_20080416.1203.LDC2009T13	I look forward to working through the rehabilitation process and getting back to action as quickly as I can."
10542	APW_ENG_20080416.1203.LDC2009T13	But he will not be able to defend his title in two weeks at the Wachovia Championship.
10543	APW_ENG_20080416.1203.LDC2009T13	And he most likely will miss The Players Championship the week after, one of only three non-majors he has never missed since turning pro.
10544	APW_ENG_20080416.1203.LDC2009T13	Provided rehab goes as expected, Woods hopes to return at the Memorial on May 29.
10545	APW_ENG_20080416.1203.LDC2009T13	The U.S. Open begins June 12 at Torrey Pines, where Woods has won six times in the Buick Invitational.
10546	APW_ENG_20080416.1203.LDC2009T13	Such is his dominance on the cliffside course north of San Diego that when he opened with a 67 on the South Course this year, a caddie standing behind the 18th green remarked, "He just won two tournaments with one round."
10547	APW_ENG_20080416.1203.LDC2009T13	Indeed, Woods went on to an eight-shot victory in his 2008 debut, the first of four straight victories this year.
10548	APW_ENG_20080416.1203.LDC2009T13	But it was not necessarily a pain-free affair.
10549	APW_ENG_20080416.1203.LDC2009T13	"Tiger has been experiencing pain in his knee since the middle of last year, and when he had it looked at by his doctors, arthroscopic surgery was recommended," said Mark Steinberg, Woods' agent at IMG.
10550	APW_ENG_20080416.1203.LDC2009T13	"Tiger has played through the pain in the past, but knew it would be better for him to have the procedure done as early as possible."
10551	APW_ENG_20080416.1203.LDC2009T13	Steinberg said the surgery repaired cartilage damage.
10552	APW_ENG_20080416.1203.LDC2009T13	The 2002 surgery drained fluid from around the anterior cruciate ligament and removed a benign cyst.
10553	APW_ENG_20080416.1203.LDC2009T13	Woods was limping and wincing toward the end of the '02 season, and it was not surprising to find out he had surgery that kept him out two months, most of that over the holidays.
10554	APW_ENG_20080416.1203.LDC2009T13	This time, it only made sense upon reviewing the past nine months.
10555	APW_ENG_20080416.1203.LDC2009T13	Woods stumbled and grimaced ever so slightly at Southern Hills last August in the PGA Championship, when he chipped in for birdie behind the eighth green in the final round and backpedaled for a fist pump.
10556	APW_ENG_20080416.1203.LDC2009T13	In the final two PGA Tour events, in Chicago and Atlanta, he occasionally would press his left foot against a cooler, presumably to stretch his knee.
10557	APW_ENG_20080416.1203.LDC2009T13	But it sure didn't affect his golf, not even at the Masters, where he finished three shots behind Trevor Immelman.
10558	APW_ENG_20080416.1203.LDC2009T13	"He hit 14 greens in regulation on Sunday," Haney said.
10559	APW_ENG_20080416.1203.LDC2009T13	"Hard to say it was the knee."
10560	APW_ENG_20080416.1203.LDC2009T13	Woods won the Bridgestone Invitational and PGA Championship in consecutive weeks, then tied for second behind Phil Mickelson at the Deutsche Bank Championship.
10561	APW_ENG_20080416.1203.LDC2009T13	That was his last loss until late March, the longest winning streak of his career, which covered five PGA Tour events, the Dubai Desert Classic on the European Tour, and his unofficial Target World Challenge in December.
10562	APW_ENG_20080416.1203.LDC2009T13	"I knew he was going to do something this year," Haney said, referring to surgery.
10563	APW_ENG_20080416.1203.LDC2009T13	"I just didn't know when."
10564	APW_ENG_20080416.1203.LDC2009T13	Woods has a remarkable track record when returning from a long layoff.
10565	APW_ENG_20080416.1203.LDC2009T13	After the '02 surgery, he won three of his first four events, including an 11-shot victory at Bay Hill.
10566	APW_ENG_20080416.1203.LDC2009T13	This will be the second time in two years, however, that he missed a chunk of time between the Masters and the U.S. Open.
10567	APW_ENG_20080416.1203.LDC2009T13	He sat out nine weeks in 2006 to cope with the May death of his father, not returning until the U.S. Open at Winged Foot.
10568	APW_ENG_20080416.1203.LDC2009T13	He missed the cut for the only time in a major since he turned pro.
10569	APW_ENG_20080416.1203.LDC2009T13	Torrey Pines is more familiar turf, even if the setup for the U.S. Open will be vastly different.
10570	APW_ENG_20080416.1203.LDC2009T13	Woods won the Buick Invitational this year for the third straight time, and he also won there as a junior.
10571	APW_ENG_20080416.1203.LDC2009T13	In the meantime, his absence is a blow to the Wachovia Championship and to The Players Championship, regarded as the fifth major.
10572	APW_ENG_20080416.1203.LDC2009T13	"Of course, we're disappointed when Tiger is unable to compete in a PGA Tour event," commissioner Tim Finchem said on the tour's Web site.
10573	APW_ENG_20080416.1203.LDC2009T13	"There is really never a good time for an athlete -- especially one of Tiger's caliber -- to take weeks off from competition during the season.
10574	APW_ENG_20080416.1203.LDC2009T13	But his health concerns have to come first."
10575	APW_ENG_20080416.1203.LDC2009T13	Of greater concern might be the fact Woods has gone through surgery twice on the same knee in five years.
10576	APW_ENG_20080416.1203.LDC2009T13	He has looked immortal at times on the golf course, already winning 64 times on the PGA Tour and 13 majors, second only to Jack Nicklaus.
10577	APW_ENG_20080416.1203.LDC2009T13	Could this slow the pursuit?
10578	APW_ENG_20080416.1203.LDC2009T13	Woods won 30 times and five majors since his last surgery, and Haney expects nothing less.
10579	APW_ENG_20080416.1203.LDC2009T13	"This is something he's already used to," Haney said.
10580	APW_ENG_20080416.1203.LDC2009T13	"He deals with stuff incredibly, like you would expect him to."
10581	APW_ENG_20080421.0526.LDC2009T13	Report: Election vote recount may take all week
10582	APW_ENG_20080421.0526.LDC2009T13	HARARE, Zimbabwe 2008-04-21 12:22:22 UTC
10583	APW_ENG_20080421.0526.LDC2009T13	The recounting of 23 contested parliamentary seats from last month's election is "fatally flawed," a South African observer said Monday as state media reported that the process might drag on all week.
10584	APW_ENG_20080421.0526.LDC2009T13	The Zimbabwe Electoral Commission said it needs longer than the three days originally envisaged for the partial recount because there is "a lot of work involved," according to the Herald newspaper.
10585	APW_ENG_20080421.0526.LDC2009T13	The recount could prove pivotal for President Robert Mugabe's ruling ZANU-PF party, which lost control of parliament in the March 29 elections for the first time in 28 years, and needs just nine seats to reclaim a majority.
10586	APW_ENG_20080421.0526.LDC2009T13	The opposition has denounced the recount as illegal and has alleged fraud.
10587	APW_ENG_20080421.0526.LDC2009T13	An observer also said ballot boxes were tampered with.
10588	APW_ENG_20080421.0526.LDC2009T13	Dianne Kohler-Barnard, a lawmaker with South Africa's opposition Democratic Alliance, called the entire recounting process "futile" Monday.
10589	APW_ENG_20080421.0526.LDC2009T13	"From what I have seen and experienced in Zimbabwe over the last three days, it is clear that the process of recounting the contested wards from the recent elections is fatally flawed," she said.
10590	APW_ENG_20080421.0526.LDC2009T13	"Of particular concern was the evidence of ballot box tampering that I witnessed personally, which points to a concerted effort to rig the election results in order to bring about a Mugabe 'victory,'" she said in a statement issued by her office in South Africa.
10591	APW_ENG_20080421.0526.LDC2009T13	Zimbabwe's opposition Movement for Democratic Change defeated ZANU-PF in the first count of the parliamentary vote.
10592	APW_ENG_20080421.0526.LDC2009T13	But electoral officials began recounting ballots Saturday for 23 contested legislative seats, most won by opposition candidates, including in Mugabe's home district of Zvimba.
10593	APW_ENG_20080421.0526.LDC2009T13	Results of the presidential election, also held March 29, still have not been announced.
10594	APW_ENG_20080421.0526.LDC2009T13	Opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai claims he won an outright victory, but independent observers say it is more likely that he would face a runoff election against 84 -year-old Mugabe.
10595	APW_ENG_20080421.0526.LDC2009T13	MDC Secretary-General Tendai Biti said Sunday that there were clear signs of irregularities in the recount.
10596	APW_ENG_20080421.0526.LDC2009T13	The opposition also claimed mounting violence and intimidation against people who voted for their candidates, especially in rural areas that once were Mugabe strongholds.
10597	APW_ENG_20080421.0526.LDC2009T13	Violence had displaced 3,000 people, injured 500 and left 10 dead, Biti said at a news conference in South Africa.
10598	APW_ENG_20080421.0526.LDC2009T13	It was impossible to verify the claims because of reporting restrictions in Zimbabwe.
10599	APW_ENG_20080421.0526.LDC2009T13	Biti said key members of the opposition's administration had been arrested, along with more than 400 supporters.
10600	APW_ENG_20080421.0526.LDC2009T13	Biti and Tsvangirai -- who has been accused of treason -- say they cannot return to Zimbabwe because they would face immediate arrest.
10601	APW_ENG_20080421.0526.LDC2009T13	Elections officials said the recount was going smoothly.
10602	APW_ENG_20080421.0526.LDC2009T13	But "there are signs that the counting might take longer than the three days we had projected," the Herald quoted Utloile Silaigwana, a deputy chief elections officer, as saying.
10603	APW_ENG_20080421.0526.LDC2009T13	He said the delay was mainly due to party agents "raising issues which they would want attended to and clarified."
10604	APW_ENG_20080421.0526.LDC2009T13	The Herald said in some constituencies, counting was proceeding at a "snail's pace" and was likely to take about one week to complete.
10605	APW_ENG_20080421.0526.LDC2009T13	Kohler-Barnard said the process was marred by delays and administrative problems.
10606	APW_ENG_20080421.0526.LDC2009T13	"The repeated miscommunication of venue addresses meant that party agents and electoral observers were frequently posted to the incorrect venue, thus undermining the observation process and contributing to further delays in the recount," she said.
10607	APW_ENG_20080421.0526.LDC2009T13	She went on to list specific instances of ballot box irregularities.
10608	APW_ENG_20080421.0526.LDC2009T13	International pressure on Mugabe to release the election results continued to mount.
10609	APW_ENG_20080421.0526.LDC2009T13	The government of neighboring Malawi called for Zimbabwe's government to resume talks with former colonizer Britain, white farmers and the opposition party -- all of whom Mugabe considers his enemies.
10610	APW_ENG_20080421.0526.LDC2009T13	The statement, dated Sunday, indicated growing differences among southern African leaders on how to help resolve Zimbabwe's crisis.
10611	APW_ENG_20080421.0526.LDC2009T13	"The Government of Malawi believes that the people of Zimbabwe should not live in the past.
10612	APW_ENG_20080421.0526.LDC2009T13	They must move on.
10613	APW_ENG_20080421.0526.LDC2009T13	Therefore, we believe that a new set of negotiations could be initiated at different levels ... so that Zimbabwe can begin to develop and transform its economy," the statement said.
10614	APW_ENG_20080421.0526.LDC2009T13	Zimbabwe's economy, with inflation raging beyond 100,500 percent, began unraveling when Mugabe ordered takeovers in the late 1990s of large, fertile farms owned by a few thousand minority whites.
10615	APW_ENG_20080421.0526.LDC2009T13	Britain initially had paid to buy some of the farms but stopped, saying Mugabe was giving the land to cronies and relatives instead of landless blacks Zimbabweans.
10616	APW_ENG_20080421.0526.LDC2009T13	New negotiations for British support for land reform ended in 1997 when Britain's Labour Party won power from the Conservatives and said it had no responsibility for whites who own farms in Zimbabwe.
10617	APW_ENG_20080421.0526.LDC2009T13	U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said he was discussing the crisis with African leaders on the sidelines of a five-day U.N. trade meeting that opened Sunday in Ghana.
10618	APW_ENG_20080421.0526.LDC2009T13	Tsvangirai, who is trying to muster more diplomatic support in Africa, was due to travel to Nigeria and then Ghana and hoped to meet Ban.

10679	APW_ENG_20080422.0668.LDC2009T13	A laboratory technician who allegedly tried to make a quick buck by stealing samples from the sperm bank where he worked has been arrested after a suspicious doctor tipped off police.
10680	APW_ENG_20080422.0668.LDC2009T13	S. Mohite, a laboratory worker at Cryobank in Aurangabad city in western India, and a relative, Anil Mohite, tried to sell 101 vials of sperm to a doctor in Mumbai for 25,000 rupees (US$625
10681	APW_ENG_20080422.0668.LDC2009T13	euro520), Aurangabad police chief K. L. Bishnoi said Tuesday.
10682	APW_ENG_20080422.0668.LDC2009T13	The doctor declined -- then called the police, who arrested the pair Sunday, Bishnoi told The Associated Press.

10698	APW_ENG_20080424.0202.LDC2009T13	TOKYO 2008-04-24 04:16:27 UTC
10699	APW_ENG_20080424.0202.LDC2009T13	Japan will not impose a blanket ban on U.S. beef imports, despite the discovery of a spinal column in a meat shipment from an American processing plant, a government spokesman said Thursday.
10700	APW_ENG_20080424.0202.LDC2009T13	Japan this week temporarily halted beef shipments from a U.S. plant after finding the spinal column, which violated a trade accord prohibiting parts believed to pose a risk of mad cow disease.
10701	APW_ENG_20080424.0202.LDC2009T13	But Chief Cabinet Secretary Nobutaka Machimura said the violation was apparently an isolated case, and Tokyo would not retaliate by blocking all beef shipments from the United States.
10702	APW_ENG_20080424.0202.LDC2009T13	"We understand this is not a systematic problem concerning U.S. exports to Japan and there is no need to impose an import ban," he told reporters.
10703	APW_ENG_20080424.0202.LDC2009T13	"But this is clearly unwelcome, and we asked the U.S. government to fully abide by conditions concerning Japan-bound shipments," Machimura added.
10704	APW_ENG_20080424.0202.LDC2009T13	The spinal column was discovered Monday at a Japanese meat- processing factory during an inspection, said a statement from the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries and the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare.
10705	APW_ENG_20080424.0202.LDC2009T13	It was found in one of 700 boxes shipped from National Beef California LP and imported by trading house Itochu Corp., the statement said.
10706	APW_ENG_20080424.0202.LDC2009T13	Shipments from the U.S.-based company have been halted.
10707	APW_ENG_20080424.0202.LDC2009T13	Japan imposed a ban on U.S. beef imports in December 2003 after the first case of mad cow disease was found in the United States.
10708	APW_ENG_20080424.0202.LDC2009T13	The ban was lifted in 2005, but imposed again in January 2006 after an import violation.
10709	APW_ENG_20080424.0202.LDC2009T13	U.S. beef imports resumed in July 2006, but sales are a fraction of what they used to be.
10710	APW_ENG_20080424.0202.LDC2009T13	Japan's finicky consumers are sensitive to suggestions American meat is unsafe, and some officials urged U.S. producers to be more careful.
10711	APW_ENG_20080424.0202.LDC2009T13	"This should not happen again," said Health Minister Yoichi Masuzoe.
10712	APW_ENG_20080424.0202.LDC2009T13	"We will continue to make maximum measures to ensure food safety."
10713	APW_ENG_20080424.0202.LDC2009T13	The U.S. Embassy said Wednesday an investigation would be conducted to find out what happened, but added that the meat shipment itself was completely safe.
10714	APW_ENG_20080424.0202.LDC2009T13	Under the agreement, Japan accepts only meat from cattle 20 months of age and younger, which are thought to pose less of a risk of the disease.

10784	APW_ENG_20080429.0128.LDC2009T13	Vietnam, where growing numbers of Americans have turned to adopt a baby, announced it would stop processing new adoption applications from U.S. citizens in July following allegations of baby-selling, corruption and fraud.
10785	APW_ENG_20080429.0128.LDC2009T13	The abrupt cutoff cast some uncertainty over pending adoptions in the Southeast Asian country, which have surged in the face of tightened restrictions in China, Guatemala and elsewhere.
10786	APW_ENG_20080429.0128.LDC2009T13	The announcement came days after The Associated Press published details of a U.S. Embassy report that outlined rampant abuses, including hospitals selling infants whose mothers could not pay their bills, brokers scouring villages for babies and a grandmother who gave away her grandchild without telling the child's mother.
10787	APW_ENG_20080429.0128.LDC2009T13	"It is tragic for children that the U.S. government has not been able to find ways to work with the Vietnamese government to prevent adoption abuses while at the same time processing legitimate adoptions," said Tom Atwood, president of the Washington-based National Council for Adoption, a research and advocacy organization.
10788	APW_ENG_20080429.0128.LDC2009T13	"Many hundreds, perhaps thousands, of children will not have families as a result of this failure of leadership."
10789	APW_ENG_20080429.0128.LDC2009T13	U.S. adoptions have boomed in Vietnam, with Americans -- including actress Angelina Jolie -- adopting more than 1,200 Vietnamese children over the 18 months ending in March.
10790	APW_ENG_20080429.0128.LDC2009T13	In 2007, adoptions quadrupled from a year earlier.
10791	APW_ENG_20080429.0128.LDC2009T13	In its nine-page report, the U.S. Embassy said some American adoption agencies paid orphanage officials as much as $10,000 per referral, while others took them on shopping sprees and junkets to the United States in return for a flow of babies.
10792	APW_ENG_20080429.0128.LDC2009T13	It said questions arose after routine investigations turned up widespread inconsistencies in adoption paperwork.
10793	APW_ENG_20080429.0128.LDC2009T13	There was also a suspicious surge in the number of babies listed as abandoned, making it impossible to confirm the children were genuine orphans or that their parents had knowingly put them up for adoption, as required by U.S. law.
10794	APW_ENG_20080429.0128.LDC2009T13	Vu Duc Long, director of Vietnam's International Adoption Agency, called the U.S. allegations "groundless."
10795	APW_ENG_20080429.0128.LDC2009T13	On Monday, he said Vietnam was scrapping a bilateral agreement with the United States that sought to regulate the adoption system.
10796	APW_ENG_20080429.0128.LDC2009T13	"They (the Americans) can say whatever they want, but we are not going to renew it," Long said.
10797	APW_ENG_20080429.0128.LDC2009T13	"I am so disappointed with the U.S. side," Long said.
10798	APW_ENG_20080429.0128.LDC2009T13	"They have been uncooperative and have no respect for us.
10799	APW_ENG_20080429.0128.LDC2009T13	It is a pity that we have had to end the agreement.
10800	APW_ENG_20080429.0128.LDC2009T13	There are many orphaned babies here, but if they are not going to have American families, they will find their families in other countries."
10801	APW_ENG_20080429.0128.LDC2009T13	In a letter to the U.S. Embassy in Hanoi, Vietnam said it would stop taking adoption applications from American families after July 1.
10802	APW_ENG_20080429.0128.LDC2009T13	Adoption arrangements with other countries are unaffected.
10803	APW_ENG_20080429.0128.LDC2009T13	The U.S. State Department said the Vietnam government would allow adoption to be completed in pending cases where prospective parents had been matched with a child and received an official referral before Sept. 1.
10804	APW_ENG_20080429.0128.LDC2009T13	After that date, it said any dossier that had not received a referral will be closed and returned to the adoption agency.
10805	APW_ENG_20080429.0128.LDC2009T13	It said given the time it takes to process a claim, any adoption initiated now would be unsuccessful.
10806	APW_ENG_20080429.0128.LDC2009T13	The U.S. Embassy said it respected Hanoi's decision, but was confident of the accuracy of its report about the situation in Vietnam.
10807	APW_ENG_20080429.0128.LDC2009T13	"The government of Vietnam has made their own decision, but we believe that our report speaks for itself," said spokeswoman Angela Aggeler.
10808	APW_ENG_20080429.0128.LDC2009T13	It was not immediately clear how many U.S. couples were affected by the decision.
10809	APW_ENG_20080429.0128.LDC2009T13	Linda Brownlee, executive director of a Washington-based international adoption agency, said the decision would mean that 20 families on its waiting list will not be able to be matched with children in time.
10810	APW_ENG_20080429.0128.LDC2009T13	"Now their dossiers will be returned to them," said Brownlee of The Adoption Center, one of more than 40 U.S. agencies that arrange adoptions of Vietnamese children.
10811	APW_ENG_20080429.0128.LDC2009T13	She said the embassy report did not cover positive aspects of adoptions in the country.
10812	APW_ENG_20080429.0128.LDC2009T13	"They didn't say how many visas they had approved with no problem," she said.
10813	APW_ENG_20080429.0128.LDC2009T13	"I know many agencies who have done great work there and that doesn't get reported."
10814	APW_ENG_20080429.0128.LDC2009T13	Keith Wallace, CEO of Families Thru International Adoption, agreed.
10815	APW_ENG_20080429.0128.LDC2009T13	"The (abuse) cases reported by the embassy ... are such a very small fraction" of U.S. adoptions in Vietnam, he said.
10816	APW_ENG_20080429.0128.LDC2009T13	"It is wrong to imply that Vietnamese adoptions are corrupt through and through."
10817	APW_ENG_20080429.0128.LDC2009T13	Vietnam suspended all adoptions with foreign countries in 2003 over concerns about corruption.
10818	APW_ENG_20080429.0128.LDC2009T13	U.S. adoptions resumed in 2005 under a bilateral agreement intended to ensure they were above board.
10819	APW_ENG_20080429.0128.LDC2009T13	It was due for renewal on Sept. 1.
10820	APW_ENG_20080429.0128.LDC2009T13	Vietnam is only the latest country where U.S. adoptions have been halted or severely restricted.
10821	APW_ENG_20080429.0128.LDC2009T13	Suspected fraud and other irregularities have cast a cloud over the nearly 3,000 pending U.S. adoptions from Guatemala, the second-largest source of U.S. adopted children after China.
10822	APW_ENG_20080429.0128.LDC2009T13	Under State Department pressure, Guatemala is allowing those to go through, but would-be parents were warned last year not to initiate new adoptions.
10823	APW_ENG_20080429.0128.LDC2009T13	By contrast, adoptions from Ethiopia are on the increase, growing 71 percent to 1,255 last year.

10828	APW_ENG_20080429.0666.LDC2009T13	KABUL, Afghanistan 2008-04-29 12:23:52 UTC
10829	APW_ENG_20080429.0666.LDC2009T13	President Hamid Karzai was warned of a weekend assassination plot against him, Afghanistan's intelligence chief said Tuesday, while admitting failings by security services that allowed militants to launch the attack.
10830	APW_ENG_20080429.0666.LDC2009T13	Meanwhile, a suicide assault killed 18 people, including 11 police, in an eastern province, officials said.
10831	APW_ENG_20080429.0666.LDC2009T13	Thirty-six people, including two Australian journalists, were wounded.
10832	APW_ENG_20080429.0666.LDC2009T13	Afghanistan's three top security officials lost no-confident votes but still retained their jobs after Amrullah Saleh told Parliament the plot to kill Karzai was hatched last month.
10833	APW_ENG_20080429.0666.LDC2009T13	The gunmen had rented the hotel room they opened fire from 45 days before the attack, he said.
10834	APW_ENG_20080429.0666.LDC2009T13	Karzai and other dignitaries escaped unharmed from Sunday's assault during a ceremony in Kabul marking Afghanistan's victory over the Soviet occupation of the country in the 1980s.
10835	APW_ENG_20080429.0666.LDC2009T13	Three other people, including a lawmaker, died.
10836	APW_ENG_20080429.0666.LDC2009T13	Three of the attackers were also killed in a gunbattle with security forces after the assault, Karzai's government said, but the Taliban said three other insurgents got away.
10837	APW_ENG_20080429.0666.LDC2009T13	"We had technical information ... that this work would happen," Saleh told a National Assembly session broadcast live on national television.
10838	APW_ENG_20080429.0666.LDC2009T13	"We passed this information to the national security (adviser) and to the president of Afghanistan."
10839	APW_ENG_20080429.0666.LDC2009T13	Despite stringent measures by security services to protect the event, "the result is that we failed," Saleh said.
10840	APW_ENG_20080429.0666.LDC2009T13	An Afghan intelligence official has said about 100 people were rounded up for questioning after the attack but it is unclear how many are still being held.
10841	APW_ENG_20080429.0666.LDC2009T13	Saleh, Defense Minister Abdur Rahim Wardak and Interior Minister Zarar Ahmad Moqbel were summoned to explain to lawmakers what happened Sunday.
10842	APW_ENG_20080429.0666.LDC2009T13	All three lost no-confidence votes against them by lawmakers on Tuesday, but the numbers were not high enough to press for their ouster.
10843	APW_ENG_20080429.0666.LDC2009T13	Before the vote, Saleh said the three attackers had been locked inside a three-story guest house for 36 hours before they tried to kill Karzai.
10844	APW_ENG_20080429.0666.LDC2009T13	He claimed that at the time of the shooting, Karzai was out of the sight of the attackers, whose view was blocked by a wall.
10845	APW_ENG_20080429.0666.LDC2009T13	All three assailants died inside the hotel room -- one from a gunshot wound and two others possibly killing themselves, Saleh said.
10846	APW_ENG_20080429.0666.LDC2009T13	Several members of police, the intelligence service and members of the president's security detail were being questioned for negligence, while a police officer has been arrested on suspicion of involvement in the attack, Saleh said.
10847	APW_ENG_20080429.0666.LDC2009T13	The attack in the Afghan capital underscored the fragile grip of Karzai's government in the face of Taliban insurgents and raised questions about its demand for Afghan police and army to take greater control of security.
10848	APW_ENG_20080429.0666.LDC2009T13	U.S. and NATO-led troops provide security in much of the country now.
10849	APW_ENG_20080429.0666.LDC2009T13	But the White House said it was unfair to criticize Afghan security forces because insurgents launched an attack.
10850	APW_ENG_20080429.0666.LDC2009T13	"When it comes to dealing with terrorists like the Taliban or al- Qaida, they just have to have even ... a little bit of an impact for everyone to say that they had a big victory," White House press secretary Dana Perino said Monday.
10851	APW_ENG_20080429.0666.LDC2009T13	"Tragically, the attackers succeeded in getting close enough to fire some shots," William Wood, the U.S. ambassador in Afghanistan, said in a statement Tuesday.
10852	APW_ENG_20080429.0666.LDC2009T13	It took authorities two minutes to defeat the attack, Wood said.
10853	APW_ENG_20080429.0666.LDC2009T13	The attack has added to unease in Kabul, which has been spared the worst of the violence as fighting has escalated between the Taliban and international troops.
10854	APW_ENG_20080429.0666.LDC2009T13	On Tuesday, a suicide attack in the volatile east of the country targeting counter-narcotics police left 18 people dead, including 11 police, and wounded 36 other people, the Interior Ministry said in a statement.
10855	APW_ENG_20080429.0666.LDC2009T13	Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack.
10856	APW_ENG_20080429.0666.LDC2009T13	The blast also wounded two Australian journalists, said a spokeswoman for Australia's Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.
10857	APW_ENG_20080429.0666.LDC2009T13	They were not identified.
10858	APW_ENG_20080429.0666.LDC2009T13	Maj. Martin O'Donnell, who speaks for the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in Afghanistan, said it had troops in the area of the attack in Khogyani district of Nangahar province, but there were no alliance casualties.
10859	APW_ENG_20080429.0666.LDC2009T13	The militants opened up with small arms fire and rocket-propelled grenades before a suicide bomber blew himself up among a crowd that was taking cover, he said.
10860	APW_ENG_20080429.0666.LDC2009T13	"If the goal was ISAF they failed," O'Donnell said of Tuesday's violence.
10861	APW_ENG_20080429.0666.LDC2009T13	"But if the goal was to injure and kill Afghans, they succeeded."
10862	APW_ENG_20080429.0666.LDC2009T13	Alliance medics were treating the wounded, he said.
10863	APW_ENG_20080429.0666.LDC2009T13	Abdul Mohammad, a provincial police official, said the bomb went off in front of the office of the district chief, who was among those hurt.
10864	APW_ENG_20080429.0666.LDC2009T13	Militants launched more than 140 suicide attacks last year, spearheading their violent campaign against the elected government of Karzai and Western forces that support it.
10865	APW_ENG_20080429.0666.LDC2009T13	Violence has intensified since the Islamist militia's ouster from power in a U.S.-led invasion in 2001, killing a record 8,000 people last year, according to the U.N.
10866	APW_ENG_20080429.0666.LDC2009T13	More than 1,000 people, mostly militants, have died in insurgency-related violence so far this year, according to an Associated Press tally of figures from Afghan and Western officials.
10867	APW_ENG_20080429.0666.LDC2009T13	In the past two days, Afghan and foreign troops have killed at least 23 insurgents and wounded 20 others in ground battles and airstrikes in the south and east of Afghanistan, officials said.

10881	APW_ENG_20080501.1417.LDC2009T13	SAN JOSE, California 2008-05-01 21:46:21 UTC
10882	APW_ENG_20080501.1417.LDC2009T13	Apple Inc. said Thursday that new movies from a slate of major studios will now be available for purchase over iTunes the same day they're released on DVD.
10883	APW_ENG_20080501.1417.LDC2009T13	The change will beef up the number of new titles available in the iTunes online store and help the service compete better against DVD retailers.
10884	APW_ENG_20080501.1417.LDC2009T13	Until this week, many of the movies available for purchase over iTunes were older releases.
10885	APW_ENG_20080501.1417.LDC2009T13	Newer releases have been available for rental through iTunes, but users typically have to wait 30 days after the DVD release to get their hands on those films, and the titles disappear from their libraries once they're finished watching.
10886	APW_ENG_20080501.1417.LDC2009T13	Apple's announcement Thursday did not include any change to the rental policies.
10887	APW_ENG_20080501.1417.LDC2009T13	iTunes movies are only available in the United States.
10888	APW_ENG_20080501.1417.LDC2009T13	The push by the Cupertino, California-based company to get people to order movies over iTunes reflects its success with the store and its desire to control more of the user's digital entertainment experience.
10889	APW_ENG_20080501.1417.LDC2009T13	Key to that campaign are the Apple TV set-top boxes, which Apple hopes will cement the company more in consumers' living rooms by streaming videos and other content from users' computers to their television sets.
10890	APW_ENG_20080501.1417.LDC2009T13	Apple said the new releases available this week for purchase over iTunes to coincide with their DVD release include "American Gangster" and "The Diving Bell and the Butterfly."
10891	APW_ENG_20080501.1417.LDC2009T13	Other new titles Apple has added to the store include "Juno," "Cloverfield," "I Am Legend," and "There Will Be Blood."
10892	APW_ENG_20080501.1417.LDC2009T13	The participating major studios are 20th Century Fox, Paramount Pictures, Sony Pictures Entertainment, The Walt Disney Studios, Warner Bros. and Universal Studios Home Entertainment.

10899	APW_ENG_20080502.0052.LDC2009T13	David Toms overcame a sore back and some recent poor form with a 5-under 67 Thursday to take the first-round lead at the Wachovia Championship.
10900	APW_ENG_20080502.0052.LDC2009T13	It was Toms' best round since before he can remember.
10901	APW_ENG_20080502.0052.LDC2009T13	"Since a long time.
10902	APW_ENG_20080502.0052.LDC2009T13	I don't know.
10903	APW_ENG_20080502.0052.LDC2009T13	I can't even think," Toms said.

10905	APW_ENG_20080502.0052.LDC2009T13	It gives me a little bit of confidence.
10906	APW_ENG_20080502.0052.LDC2009T13	It wasn't a fluke round."
10907	APW_ENG_20080502.0052.LDC2009T13	Playing in the morning when the greens were still soft from the drenching rain earlier in the week, Toms made eight birdies, including a near ace at the 13th hole, to take a one-shot lead over Phil Mickelson and Jason Bohn.
10908	APW_ENG_20080502.0052.LDC2009T13	It was a welcome change for the 2001 U.S. PGA Championship winner, whose last victory was more than two years ago.
10909	APW_ENG_20080502.0052.LDC2009T13	Swinging too hard two months ago at the Match Play Championship caused a disk problem to flare up.
10910	APW_ENG_20080502.0052.LDC2009T13	He followed that withdrawal with two missed cuts while on pain medication, shot an 80 in the final round of the Masters, and tied for 61st at the Verizon Heritage.
10911	APW_ENG_20080502.0052.LDC2009T13	"I've been out here long enough that the only time it's really fun for me is when I have a chance to win and contend in tournaments," said Toms, a 12-time tour winner.
10912	APW_ENG_20080502.0052.LDC2009T13	"Grinding to make the cut is too much like work.
10913	APW_ENG_20080502.0052.LDC2009T13	Playing well, I obviously enjoy that a lot more."
10914	APW_ENG_20080502.0052.LDC2009T13	Mickelson, in his first tournament since the Masters, showed off his new, longer putter in shooting a 68.
10915	APW_ENG_20080502.0052.LDC2009T13	Mickelson hit 12 of 14 fairways and had only 26 putts.
10916	APW_ENG_20080502.0052.LDC2009T13	"I haven't had as much soreness after the round in my back," Mickelson said.
10917	APW_ENG_20080502.0052.LDC2009T13	"I haven't had any back problems, but just muscular, sore.
10918	APW_ENG_20080502.0052.LDC2009T13	I think not having to bend over as much might allow me to practice a little bit easier."
10919	APW_ENG_20080502.0052.LDC2009T13	Bohn, like Toms and Mickelson, had an early tee time.
10920	APW_ENG_20080502.0052.LDC2009T13	He made six birdies in a satisfying round as he works his way back from stress fractures in his ribs suffered last year at the Memorial.
10921	APW_ENG_20080502.0052.LDC2009T13	"I'm 100 percent healthy and I'm still trying to shake a little of the rust off my golf game," Bohn said.
10922	APW_ENG_20080502.0052.LDC2009T13	Zach Johnson and Ben Curtis led a group of nine two shots back, while Vijay Singh and Rory Sabbatini were among 11 three off the lead at 70.
10923	APW_ENG_20080502.0052.LDC2009T13	No one was able to make a charge late in the day on Toms as the course dried out and the greens quickened.
10924	APW_ENG_20080502.0052.LDC2009T13	It was another rough day for Masters champion Trevor Immelman.

10928	APW_ENG_20080502.1098.LDC2009T13	It is safe to say Jeremy Snyder gets a charge out of the two-seat Tesla Roadster whenever he pulls one off the lot -- and not because it's equipped with an all-electric engine.
10929	APW_ENG_20080502.1098.LDC2009T13	As he pulled one of the sleek new automobiles down a side street Thursday and put the pedal to the metal, its lithium-ion battery- powered engine didn't give off sparks.
10930	APW_ENG_20080502.1098.LDC2009T13	It just emitted a powerful hum, something like a much quieter version of a jet taking off.
10931	APW_ENG_20080502.1098.LDC2009T13	"Accelerate pretty good?"
10932	APW_ENG_20080502.1098.LDC2009T13	asked Snyder, head of client services for Tesla, who knew the answer.
10933	APW_ENG_20080502.1098.LDC2009T13	"I call it a turbine sound," he said of the sound.
10934	APW_ENG_20080502.1098.LDC2009T13	"Because it's an electric motor it's got 100 percent torque all the time.
10935	APW_ENG_20080502.1098.LDC2009T13	So it just pulls you like when you're taking off in an airplane."
10936	APW_ENG_20080502.1098.LDC2009T13	After several years of development, the Roadster -- with sleek lines like a Ferrari or Porsche and a sticker price of $109,000 (euro70,513) -- officially moves from the drawing boards to the market next week when Tesla's first store opens.
10937	APW_ENG_20080502.1098.LDC2009T13	It's near the University of California, Los Angeles, in the city's toney Westwood neighborhood where Beverly Hills, Brentwood and Hollywood practically intersect.
10938	APW_ENG_20080502.1098.LDC2009T13	"Because it's Hollywood and glamorous, this is the flagship store," Snyder said.
10939	APW_ENG_20080502.1098.LDC2009T13	The next store is to open in a couple months near Tesla's headquarters in the Silicon Valley city of San Carlos, where the car was developed with venture capital of more than $40 million (euro26 million) from such investors as Google Inc. founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin.

10953	APW_ENG_20080502.1098.LDC2009T13	"Delivery is running about 15 months," Allen said, adding the company was surprised by the demand.
10954	APW_ENG_20080502.1098.LDC2009T13	Tesla began taking orders last year for the 600 Roadsters it planned to produce in 2008 and had sold all of them by October, Allen said.
10955	APW_ENG_20080502.1098.LDC2009T13	The first ones began rolling off the production line six weeks ago, and Allen said all of the 2008 models should be delivered to their owners by March of next year.

10977	APW_ENG_20080509.0006.LDC2009T13	Agriculture Minister Tony Burke told Fairfax newspapers that resumption of exports will be subject to strict conditions, including that the cattle are handled according to international standards and slaughtered only at a new facility east of Cairo.

10982	APW_ENG_20080511.0391.LDC2009T13	STOCKHOLM, Sweden 2008-05-11 13:06:27 UTC
10983	APW_ENG_20080511.0391.LDC2009T13	Don't expect any promising teenagers to break into Sweden's squad for the European Championship.
10984	APW_ENG_20080511.0391.LDC2009T13	Lars Lagerback, the only coach ever to bring Sweden to five consecutive major championships, prefers experience over youth, and he will choose which players will head to Austria and Switzerland next month along those lines.
10985	APW_ENG_20080511.0391.LDC2009T13	"Top-level football today is incredibly demanding, so I don't think it's possible to go from nowhere into the national team," the 59-year-old Lagerback said.
10986	APW_ENG_20080511.0391.LDC2009T13	"I don't understand how you can select a player who is 17 years old.
10987	APW_ENG_20080511.0391.LDC2009T13	What's the motivation for that?"
10988	APW_ENG_20080511.0391.LDC2009T13	Lagerback was referring to former England coach Sven-Goran Eriksson, a fellow Swede, who called up Theo Walcott for the 2006 World Cup when he was only 17.
10989	APW_ENG_20080511.0391.LDC2009T13	Spain, one of Sweden's rivals in Group D, has also left the door open to talented youngsters, with 20-year-old Cesc Fabregas and 22-year-old Sergio Ramos entering the squad when they were still in their teens.
10990	APW_ENG_20080511.0391.LDC2009T13	Lagerback's philosophy, however, is to stack the bench with seasoned players he knows can handle the pressure of international competition "in case the squad is hit by a stomach bug, or four players get injured or sick."
10991	APW_ENG_20080511.0391.LDC2009T13	Ten veterans older than 30, including 36-year-old midfielder Niclas Alexandersson and 34-year-old striker Marcus Allback, are likely to be picked.
10992	APW_ENG_20080511.0391.LDC2009T13	If former Celtic and FC Barcelona striker Henrik Larsson hadn't retired from the national team two years ago, the 36-yearold Swede would also probably still be in the squad.
10993	APW_ENG_20080511.0391.LDC2009T13	Lagerback has been criticized for not making room for more up- and-coming youngsters such as 19-year-old Sebastian Rajalakso, who scored five goals in his first five matches for Djurgarden this season.
10994	APW_ENG_20080511.0391.LDC2009T13	But it takes more than one successful season in the domestic Allsvenskan league to impress Lagerback, who usually wants players to prove themselves in bigger European leagues.
10995	APW_ENG_20080511.0391.LDC2009T13	"He wants you to be ready before you get the chance," said 30 -year-old midfielder Daniel Andersson, who has made regular appearances for Sweden since 2000, though mostly as a substitute.
10996	APW_ENG_20080511.0391.LDC2009T13	"It's a big step from Allsvenskan to play in the national team," Andersson added.
10997	APW_ENG_20080511.0391.LDC2009T13	"If you're playing in La Liga, Premier League or Serie A, then you're already on a high level."
10998	APW_ENG_20080511.0391.LDC2009T13	Lagerback may be a master tactician, but he's no gambler.
10999	APW_ENG_20080511.0391.LDC2009T13	He believes "continuity" has been the key to Sweden's success since he took charge in 2000, first as co-coach with Tommy Soderberg, and since Euro 2004 as the sole commander, flanked by assistant coach Roland Andersson.
11000	APW_ENG_20080511.0391.LDC2009T13	Together they have molded a highly efficient team, where each player has a clear role and knows exactly what's expected of him.
11001	APW_ENG_20080511.0391.LDC2009T13	The downside is, so do the opponents.
11002	APW_ENG_20080511.0391.LDC2009T13	Anyone facing Sweden in a competitive match in the past few years could count on roughly the same formation: Zlatan Ibrahimovic spearheading the attack, Fredrik Ljungberg and Christian Wilhemsson foraying down the flanks, and workhorse Tobias Linderoth in a defensive midfield role.
11003	APW_ENG_20080511.0391.LDC2009T13	"We've been able to work all these years with a fundamental style of play.
11004	APW_ENG_20080511.0391.LDC2009T13	That makes it easier to bring in new players," Lagerback said.
11005	APW_ENG_20080511.0391.LDC2009T13	"They gradually learn their roles and others' roles very well.
11006	APW_ENG_20080511.0391.LDC2009T13	So I think continuity is a success factor."
11007	APW_ENG_20080511.0391.LDC2009T13	Sweden has qualified for three European Championships and two World Cups under Lagerback's leadership.
11008	APW_ENG_20080511.0391.LDC2009T13	After being ousted in the group stage of Euro 2000, Sweden advanced to the second round in the following competitions.
11009	APW_ENG_20080511.0391.LDC2009T13	That's no small feat for a country outside of Europe's traditional soccer elite.
11010	APW_ENG_20080511.0391.LDC2009T13	Still, many Swedes have criticized Lagerback for the nation's lack of success in the knockout stages.
11011	APW_ENG_20080511.0391.LDC2009T13	The Swedes lost to the Netherlands on penalties in Euro 2004 quarterfinals, and exited the last two World Cups in the round of 16 -- in extra time against Senegal in 2002 and after a 2-0 loss to host Germany in 2006.
11012	APW_ENG_20080511.0391.LDC2009T13	Lagerback doesn't think he could have done much differently.
11013	APW_ENG_20080511.0391.LDC2009T13	"Take Holland and Senegal.
11014	APW_ENG_20080511.0391.LDC2009T13	We hit the post.
11015	APW_ENG_20080511.0391.LDC2009T13	That's how close we were to winning in extra time," he said.
11016	APW_ENG_20080511.0391.LDC2009T13	Besides Spain, Sweden faces Russia and defending champion Greece in Group D.
11017	APW_ENG_20080511.0391.LDC2009T13	Lagerback, whose contract expires in 2010, believes Sweden can beat any opponent on a good day, but admits that it lacks the depth of talent found in the bigger European teams.
11018	APW_ENG_20080511.0391.LDC2009T13	"We're very dependent on including our six, seven best players," he said, noting that his team risks to "overburden our best players in the group stage in order to advance."
11019	APW_ENG_20080511.0391.LDC2009T13	"But I also think it's about skill level," Lagerback added.
11020	APW_ENG_20080511.0391.LDC2009T13	"We have to improve one notch to take another step from the quarterfinals."

11023	APW_ENG_20080516.0989.LDC2009T13	Malaysian opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim said Friday he would have enough support to topple Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi's government by September.
11024	APW_ENG_20080516.0989.LDC2009T13	Anwar told reporters that his People's Justice Party needed just 30 members to gain a simple majority in parliament.
11025	APW_ENG_20080516.0989.LDC2009T13	His party controls 82 seats in the legislature.
11026	APW_ENG_20080516.0989.LDC2009T13	"By our calculation, we should move before Sept. 16," he said during his visit to Mumbai, India's financial and entertainment capital, for a lecture series on "Human Rights Awareness."
11027	APW_ENG_20080516.0989.LDC2009T13	The date is significant as his country celebrates Sept. 16 as "Malaysia Day" -- commemorating the establishment of the Malaysian federation in 1963 by joining the provinces of Malaya, Singapore, Sabah and Sarawak.
11028	APW_ENG_20080516.0989.LDC2009T13	Although Anwar has made such claims several times in the past, Friday was the first time he has given a specific timeframe to try to pull down the government.
11029	APW_ENG_20080516.0989.LDC2009T13	He was ousted from government in 1998 by then-Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad in a power struggle amid accusations of corruption and sodomy.
11030	APW_ENG_20080516.0989.LDC2009T13	Anwar denied the charges, which he said were trumped up.
11031	APW_ENG_20080516.0989.LDC2009T13	The sodomy charge was later overturned, but he served prison time after being convicted of corruption.
11032	APW_ENG_20080516.0989.LDC2009T13	The corruption charge prevented him from holding public office until April 14, 2008, which meant he could not contest the March 8 general elections.
11033	APW_ENG_20080516.0989.LDC2009T13	A record 82 opposition members from a three-party alliance led by Anwar were elected to the 222-member lower house in the elections.
11034	APW_ENG_20080516.0989.LDC2009T13	This shook the ruling National Front's grip on governance for the first time in 40 years.
11035	APW_ENG_20080516.0989.LDC2009T13	Anwar said last month that it won't be long before he is elected a lawmaker in a by-election.
11036	APW_ENG_20080516.0989.LDC2009T13	"We have enough numbers now.
11037	APW_ENG_20080516.0989.LDC2009T13	But we want the transition to be peaceful and democratic," he said Friday.
11038	APW_ENG_20080516.0989.LDC2009T13	He has said any government he forms will change Malaysia's system of promoting majority ethnic Malays -- Anwar himself is Malay -- in government contracts, jobs and education over ethnic Chinese and Indian Malaysians.
11039	APW_ENG_20080516.0989.LDC2009T13	"Many ruling party members of parliament know that the time for racial politics is over," said Anwar, adding that he was confident that governing party members would defect to his side.

11042	APW_ENG_20080517.0330.LDC2009T13	Huge swathes of farmland were destroyed by the earthquake in central China, but the losses should not cause food shortages or big price hikes nationally, a senior official said Saturday.
11043	APW_ENG_20080517.0330.LDC2009T13	The devastated province of Sichuan is an important growing region for rice, wheat, corn and other crops, producing 6 percent of China's grain.
11044	APW_ENG_20080517.0330.LDC2009T13	Wei Chao'an, China's vice minister for agriculture, said the earthquake destroyed more than 75,000 acres (30,000 hectares) of farmland in the province.
11045	APW_ENG_20080517.0330.LDC2009T13	"This disaster led to serious losses in agricultural production in the affected areas, but the situation of agricultural production across the whole country remains good," Wei told a news conference.

11047	APW_ENG_20080517.0330.LDC2009T13	We have full confidence in this."
11048	APW_ENG_20080517.0330.LDC2009T13	Wei said there was enough food to supply the market and affected areas.
11049	APW_ENG_20080517.0330.LDC2009T13	Authorities have arranged special shipments of fuel, grain and edible oil to prevent shortages.
11050	APW_ENG_20080517.0330.LDC2009T13	Consumer prices have jumped across China since mid-2007, driven by rises in food costs that hit 22.1 percent in April.

11059	APW_ENG_20080518.0873.LDC2009T13	Kennedy's wife, Vicki, was seen walking into the hospital early Sunday morning.
11060	APW_ENG_20080518.0873.LDC2009T13	The aide said his daughter, stepdaughters and sister Jean Kennedy Smith also visited during the day.

11071	APW_ENG_20080518.0886.LDC2009T13	McCain ' s national finance co-chair Loeffler resigns because of lobbyist ties
11072	APW_ENG_20080518.0886.LDC2009T13	WASHINGTON 2008-05-18 21:28:30 UTC
11073	APW_ENG_20080518.0886.LDC2009T13	John McCain's national finance co-chairman has stepped down, the latest casualty of a presidential campaign eager to cauterize damage caused by its ties to lobbyists.
11074	APW_ENG_20080518.0886.LDC2009T13	Former Texas Rep. Thomas G. Loeffler, one of McCain's key fundraisers, resigned in the wake of a new McCain policy on conflicts of interest that required campaign volunteers to disclose their lobbying connections.
11075	APW_ENG_20080518.0886.LDC2009T13	"Mr. Loeffler has resigned from his position with the campaign," McCain spokesman Tucker Bounds said Sunday.
11076	APW_ENG_20080518.0886.LDC2009T13	Loeffler, who runs the lobbying shop The Loeffler Group, is the highest profile departure from McCain's inner circle since a summer 2007 shake-up cost McCain his campaign manager and chief strategist.
11077	APW_ENG_20080518.0886.LDC2009T13	Among Loeffler's clients is the European Aeronautic Defence and Space Co., the parent company of plane manufacturer Airbus.
11078	APW_ENG_20080518.0886.LDC2009T13	Northrop Grumman Corp. and EADS won a lucrative contract to provide air refueling tankers for the Air Force.
11079	APW_ENG_20080518.0886.LDC2009T13	McCain helped scuttle an earlier contract in 2004 that would have gone to a competitor, Boeing Co.
11080	APW_ENG_20080518.0886.LDC2009T13	Loeffler's firm also has lobbied for other foreign interests and foreign governments.
11081	APW_ENG_20080518.0886.LDC2009T13	Newsweek reported over the weekend that Loeffler's firm was paid $15 (euro9.68) million by Saudi Arabia.
11082	APW_ENG_20080518.0886.LDC2009T13	The news magazine also said Loeffler listed meeting McCain along with the Saudi ambassador to "discuss US-Kingdom of Saudi Arabia relations," even though Loeffler told a reporter last month that he had not discussed his clients with McCain.
11083	APW_ENG_20080518.0886.LDC2009T13	McCain's new policy prohibits any staffer on the campaign from being a registered lobbyist or foreign agent.
11084	APW_ENG_20080518.0886.LDC2009T13	Part-time volunteers for the campaigns, such as Loeffler, have to disclose whether they are registered lobbyists or lobbying on behalf of foreign entities.
11085	APW_ENG_20080518.0886.LDC2009T13	Under the policy, dated May 15, such volunteer advisers cannot lobby McCain or his legislative staffs during the period they serve on the campaign.
11086	APW_ENG_20080518.0886.LDC2009T13	The work of lobbyists close to McCain had become fodder for critics, undermining McCain's image as a reformer who has tried to restrict the influence special interests in government.
11087	APW_ENG_20080518.0886.LDC2009T13	McCain advisers Doug Goodyear, who was to run the Republican convention in St. Paul, Minnesota, and Doug Davenport, a regional campaign director for the Mid-Atlantic states, also resigned this month.
11088	APW_ENG_20080518.0886.LDC2009T13	Both worked for DCI Group, a consulting firm hired to improve the image of Myanmar's military junta.
11089	APW_ENG_20080518.0886.LDC2009T13	When the policy was announced last week, McCain fired energy policy adviser Eric Burgeson, who represents energy companies as a lobbyist.
11090	APW_ENG_20080518.0886.LDC2009T13	The campaign also asked Craig Shirley to resign from McCain's Virginia leadership team because he was behind an independent group that has been criticizing Democrats Hillary Rodham Clinton and Barack Obama on the Internet.
11091	APW_ENG_20080518.0886.LDC2009T13	McCain's new policy also states that no one with a campaign title or position may participate in so-called 527 groups, which can raise unlimited amounts of money for television ads not controlled by campaigns.
11092	APW_ENG_20080518.0886.LDC2009T13	But the policy also underscored the fine line McCain has drawn.
11093	APW_ENG_20080518.0886.LDC2009T13	Several top strategists working on his campaign are lobbyists who have taken leaves of absence from their jobs to work for McCain.
11094	APW_ENG_20080518.0886.LDC2009T13	Among them are campaign manager Rick Davis, whose past clients have included a Russian industrialist, and Charlie Black, a high profile Washington lobbyist with domestic and foreign clients
11095	APW_ENG_20080518.0886.LDC2009T13	In adopting the policy and making it public, the McCain campaign sought to stabilize the bad press he was getting and turn the tables on his most likely Democratic opponent.
11096	APW_ENG_20080518.0886.LDC2009T13	"Sen. McCain has put forward the most strident policy to date," said McCain spokeswoman Jill Hazelbaker.
11097	APW_ENG_20080518.0886.LDC2009T13	"It now falls on Barack Obama to meet this level of transparency and disclose which lobbyists are serving as advisers to his campaign."
11098	APW_ENG_20080518.0886.LDC2009T13	Obama has been a vocal critic of Washington lobbyists and, unlike McCain, has refused to accept contributions from federal lobbyists and from political action committees.
11099	APW_ENG_20080518.0886.LDC2009T13	However, he has accepted money from the corporate executives who retain lobbyists and who have special causes before Congress.
11100	APW_ENG_20080518.0886.LDC2009T13	He also has had unpaid advisers with federal lobbying clients.
11101	APW_ENG_20080518.0886.LDC2009T13	Some campaign officials previously had lobbying jobs.
11102	APW_ENG_20080518.0886.LDC2009T13	Earlier this year, Obama deputy campaign manager Steve Hildebrand told The Associated Press the campaign has no problem with lobbyists volunteering to work, but no federal lobbyists are on the campaign's payroll and they cannot donate money or collect it from others.
11103	APW_ENG_20080518.0886.LDC2009T13	"We're not going to prevent people from being volunteers on this campaign," he said.
11104	APW_ENG_20080518.0886.LDC2009T13	Hildebrand said he gave up federal lobbying work for an environmental group, as a condition of taking his paid staff position.
11105	APW_ENG_20080518.0886.LDC2009T13	According to lobbying records, Hildebrand was lobbying on behalf of climate change legislation written by McCain and Sen. Joseph Lieberman, from Connecticut.

11107	APW_ENG_20080519.0784.LDC2009T13	JOHANNESBURG, South Africa 2008-05-19 15:35:46 UTC
11108	APW_ENG_20080519.0784.LDC2009T13	Double-amputee sprinter Oscar Pistorius believes he may have a more realistic chance of qualifying for the 2012 London Olympics than this summer's Beijing Games.
11109	APW_ENG_20080519.0784.LDC2009T13	Pistorius returned to South Africa after the Court of Arbitration for Sport overturned an IAAF ruling that barred him from competing in the Olympics and other able-bodied events.
11110	APW_ENG_20080519.0784.LDC2009T13	The court said the 21-year-old's carbon fiber racing blades do not give him an unfair advantage over able-bodied runners.
11111	APW_ENG_20080519.0784.LDC2009T13	Pistorius said Monday he will be competing in able-bodied meets to try to qualify for the Aug. 8-24 Beijing Games, but acknowledged it will be difficult to get into the proper shape.
11112	APW_ENG_20080519.0784.LDC2009T13	He said the London Olympics also are in his plans.
11113	APW_ENG_20080519.0784.LDC2009T13	"The last five months have been extremely tiring," Pistorius said, adding that months of prosthetic testing, overseas travel and marathon conference calls had hampered his training.
11114	APW_ENG_20080519.0784.LDC2009T13	"But I have the opportunity now so I might as well grab it with both hands."
11115	APW_ENG_20080519.0784.LDC2009T13	Pistorius holds the 400-meter Paralympic world record of 46.56 seconds, but that time is outside the Olympic qualifying standard of 45.55.
11116	APW_ENG_20080519.0784.LDC2009T13	He admits the chance of shedding a second off his time is slim, and that he is now hoping to qualify for London.
11117	APW_ENG_20080519.0784.LDC2009T13	"Realistically speaking...I have a better chance of qualifying there because I haven't had the chance to train," he said.
11118	APW_ENG_20080519.0784.LDC2009T13	Even if Pistorius fails to get the qualifying time, South African selectors could add the University of Pretoria student to the Olympic 1,600-meter relay squad.
11119	APW_ENG_20080519.0784.LDC2009T13	"That chance still exists," said Peet van Zyl, Pistorius' agent.
11120	APW_ENG_20080519.0784.LDC2009T13	"But the South Africa team needs to qualify."
11121	APW_ENG_20080519.0784.LDC2009T13	Pistorius would not require a qualifying time and could be taken to Beijing as an alternate.
11122	APW_ENG_20080519.0784.LDC2009T13	Six runners can be picked for the relay squad, which would need to be one of the world's top 16 teams to participate in the Olympics.
11123	APW_ENG_20080519.0784.LDC2009T13	Pistorius, smiling broadly as he sat behind a table in a black suit, told reporters that he'd jump at the chance to join the relay team.
11124	APW_ENG_20080519.0784.LDC2009T13	"I'd be extremely happy," he said.
11125	APW_ENG_20080519.0784.LDC2009T13	"It's always been a dream of mine."
11126	APW_ENG_20080519.0784.LDC2009T13	Pistorius will run in five Paralympic races in May and June, van Zyl said.
11127	APW_ENG_20080519.0784.LDC2009T13	He'll be competing in able-bodied competitions on July 2 in Milan, Italy, on July 11 in Rome, and July 16 in Lucerne, Switzerland.
11128	APW_ENG_20080519.0784.LDC2009T13	He will likely add one or two more able-bodied races depending in his schedule.
11129	APW_ENG_20080519.0784.LDC2009T13	Pistorius was born without fibulas -- the long, thin outer bone between the knee and ankle -- and was 11 months old when his legs were amputated below the knee.
11130	APW_ENG_20080519.0784.LDC2009T13	In January, the IAAF banned Pistorius from competing internationally with able-bodied athletes.
11131	APW_ENG_20080519.0784.LDC2009T13	The body based its decision on studies by German professor Gert-Peter Brueggemann, who said the J-shaped "Cheetah" blades were energy efficient, and could give Pistorius a possible advantage.
11132	APW_ENG_20080519.0784.LDC2009T13	Pistorius' lawyers countered with independent tests conducted by a team led by MIT professor Hugh M. Herr that claimed to show he doesn't gain any advantage over able-bodied runners.
11133	APW_ENG_20080519.0784.LDC2009T13	At first, Pistorius said, his court battle was about his own desire to compete with able-bodies athletes, but it eventually became a fight for all amputee athletes eager for the same opportunities.
11134	APW_ENG_20080519.0784.LDC2009T13	"It's always been a dream to compete in the Olympics," Pistorius said, "But If I look back at my career and I haven't participated, it will still be a a dream satisfied."
11135	APW_ENG_20080519.0784.LDC2009T13	Although Pistorius wished he could have spent the last months training, he said his long plane rides back and forth across the Atlantic were a mixed blessing.
11136	APW_ENG_20080519.0784.LDC2009T13	They gave him plenty of time to reflect on his experiences, which will be included in a book he's publishing in July.

11138	APW_ENG_20080519.0816.LDC2009T13	NEW YORK 2008-05-19 15:55:52 UTC
11139	APW_ENG_20080519.0816.LDC2009T13	Thomson Reuters Corp. will cut 1,500 jobs as the newly combined financial and professional information provider moves to consolidate operations and reduce costs, a person familiar with the matter said Monday.
11140	APW_ENG_20080519.0816.LDC2009T13	Thomson Reuters had been widely expected to eliminate overlaps between the companies and make cut jobs following Thomson Corp.'s acquisition of Reuters Group PLC on April 17.
11141	APW_ENG_20080519.0816.LDC2009T13	Thomson, a Canadian company that sells legal, professional and market information, paid about $15.8 billion (euro10.14 billion) to acquire Reuters, a London-based financial news and information company.
11142	APW_ENG_20080519.0816.LDC2009T13	The cuts represent about 3 percent of Thomson Reuters' global work force of about 50,000.
11143	APW_ENG_20080519.0816.LDC2009T13	The person familiar with the situation, who asked to remain anonymous since there was no formal announcement of the job cuts, said the layoffs would be completed by the end of the year, and include about 140 editorial positions.
11144	APW_ENG_20080519.0816.LDC2009T13	The person would not say where the job were planned.
11145	APW_ENG_20080519.0816.LDC2009T13	Thomson and Reuters have several areas of overlap, including some news operations as well as services that provide earnings estimates for publicly traded companies.
11146	APW_ENG_20080519.0816.LDC2009T13	The company had said on May 1 when it reported earnings that it expected to see annual cost savings of up to $1 billion (euro640 million) by the end of 2010, earlier than had been previously expected.
11147	APW_ENG_20080519.0816.LDC2009T13	In addition to financial news and data, the company is also a major information provider to the legal, medical, tax and accounting professions.

11150	APW_ENG_20080521.0453.LDC2009T13	FRANKFURT, Germany 2008-05-21 09:21:22 UTC
11151	APW_ENG_20080521.0453.LDC2009T13	German business confidence posted an unexpected increase for May, retreating from the more than two-year low set a month earlier and indicating that companies have so far weathered record euro and oil prices, a closely watched survey showed Wednesday.
11152	APW_ENG_20080521.0453.LDC2009T13	The Ifo institute's index rose to 103.5 points in May compared with 102.4 points in April and 104.8 points in March, reflecting concern about the record-setting euro and soaring oil prices.
11153	APW_ENG_20080521.0453.LDC2009T13	The reading was better than the 101.9 points that analysts by Dow Jones Newswires had forecast.
11154	APW_ENG_20080521.0453.LDC2009T13	"On the whole, the dampening of economic activity in Germany in the months following the very good first quarter should be moderate," the institute said of the results, gathered from polling of 7,000 firms in Germany.
11155	APW_ENG_20080521.0453.LDC2009T13	A subindex measuring managers' six-month outlook edged upward to 97.3 points from 96.8 points in April.
11156	APW_ENG_20080521.0453.LDC2009T13	Managers' assessment of their current economic situation also rose for the second time in four months.
11157	APW_ENG_20080521.0453.LDC2009T13	That subindex increased to 110.1 points from 108.4 points in April.
11158	APW_ENG_20080521.0453.LDC2009T13	"The renewed surprising upward movement in the Ifo business climate underscores that the German economy is currently better positioned than most of its European neighbors," said Alexander Koch, vice president and economist with UniCredit in Munich.
11159	APW_ENG_20080521.0453.LDC2009T13	However, he warned that the German economy, Europe's biggest, was not invulnerable.
11160	APW_ENG_20080521.0453.LDC2009T13	"The German economy won't escape unscathed from the global economic downturn," he said.
11161	APW_ENG_20080521.0453.LDC2009T13	"Despite the current rise, the trend in the important expectations component points south and currently signals a softening in the growth dynamic to around potential by the second half of this year, with the outlook for expectations skewed to the downside in the months ahead."
11162	APW_ENG_20080521.0453.LDC2009T13	Ifo's report found that manufacturing companies were still planning moderate increases in employment, in part because "export opportunities continued to be appraised as good," the Munich-based agency said.
11163	APW_ENG_20080521.0453.LDC2009T13	Though it conceded that "firms are not quite as optimistic as in the previous month."
11164	APW_ENG_20080521.0453.LDC2009T13	Timo Klein, an analyst with Global Insight in Frankfurt, said the report's findings "were relatively uniform across sectors this time."
11165	APW_ENG_20080521.0453.LDC2009T13	"The wholesale and retail sectors both recovered after April's declines, driven by a more favorable assessment of their current situation but also by improved expectations," he said.
11166	APW_ENG_20080521.0453.LDC2009T13	"Retail expectations in particular remain clearly better than in late 2007, so that an improving trend for German consumer demand during the remainder of 2008 is becoming increasingly likely."
11167	APW_ENG_20080521.0453.LDC2009T13	The report was opposite of the latest survey of German investor confidence, which declined for a second straight month.
11168	APW_ENG_20080521.0453.LDC2009T13	On Tuesday, the ZEW institute's monthly index of investors' expectations for the German economy over the next six months dropped to minus 41.4 points in May from minus 40.7 points in April.
11169	APW_ENG_20080521.0453.LDC2009T13	The decline was worse than the minus 37 points analysts polled by Dow Jones Newswires had predicted.
11170	APW_ENG_20080521.0453.LDC2009T13	The historical average is plus 29.6 points.

11175	APW_ENG_20080521.0621.LDC2009T13	Left-wing legislators asked the Philippine Supreme Court on Wednesday to order an immediate halt to a scientific study by the state oil companies of China, Vietnam and the Philippines in the disputed Spratly islands.
11176	APW_ENG_20080521.0621.LDC2009T13	President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo and three of her Cabinet members committed "treachery of the highest order" and a "betrayal of paramount proportions" by allowing the three-year seismic study, the six legislators said in a joint petition.
11177	APW_ENG_20080521.0621.LDC2009T13	Given the extent of the study, which allegedly encompasses disputed Spratly waters in the South China Sea and Philippine territorial waters, "the state compromises and bargains away its national economy and patrimony, national sovereignty," they said.
11178	APW_ENG_20080521.0621.LDC2009T13	"It's a sellout," said Rep. Satur Ocampo, one of the petitioners.
11179	APW_ENG_20080521.0621.LDC2009T13	He said the agreement to undertake the study could weaken the Philippines' claim to the Spratlys archipelago, which includes rich fishing grounds, straddles the world's busiest shipping lanes and is believed to sit atop vast deposits of oil and gas.
11180	APW_ENG_20080521.0621.LDC2009T13	Aside from China, the Philippines and Vietnam, Brunei, Malaysia and Taiwan also claim all or parts of the remote islands.
11181	APW_ENG_20080521.0621.LDC2009T13	The petitioners claim the Joint Marine Seismic Undertaking violates the Philippine Constitution, which allows only the Manila government to explore and exploit natural resources within its territory.
11182	APW_ENG_20080521.0621.LDC2009T13	The government also can undertake explorations with companies that are at least 60 percent owned by Filipinos, they said.
11183	APW_ENG_20080521.0621.LDC2009T13	The seismic study, part of oil exploration, is being undertaken by Philippine National Oil Co., China National Offshore Oil Corp. and Vietnam Oil and Gas Corp.
11184	APW_ENG_20080521.0621.LDC2009T13	The three governments have not said whether any sign of oil or gas has been found in the sprawling area.
11185	APW_ENG_20080521.0621.LDC2009T13	The study is to end next month.

11194	APW_ENG_20080525.0355.LDC2009T13	The deadline for pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi's house arrest expires this week, but Myanmar's military rulers remained silent about her fate Sunday as international donors pushed politics aside to help suffering cyclone victims.
11195	APW_ENG_20080525.0355.LDC2009T13	The detention of Nobel Peace Prize laureate Suu Kyi has been at the center of friction between the secretive junta and many countries around the world, who have tirelessly campaigned for her release.
11196	APW_ENG_20080525.0355.LDC2009T13	She was last put under house arrest in May 2003, and the term has been renewed every year since.
11197	APW_ENG_20080525.0355.LDC2009T13	But this year's deadline comes at a critical point.
11198	APW_ENG_20080525.0355.LDC2009T13	Under Myanmar law, no one can be held longer than five years without being released or put on trial, said U.S. lawyer Jared Genser, hired by Suu Kyi's family to push for her release.
11199	APW_ENG_20080525.0355.LDC2009T13	It remained unclear what action, if any, the regime would take as the world focuses on the Southeast Asian country still reeling from Cyclone Nargis.
11200	APW_ENG_20080525.0355.LDC2009T13	The storm killed 78,000 people three weeks ago and left another 2.4 million people homeless and facing hunger and disease.
11201	APW_ENG_20080525.0355.LDC2009T13	U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and representatives from 50 nations met Sunday for a one-day fundraising conference in Myanmar's biggest city, Yangon.
11202	APW_ENG_20080525.0355.LDC2009T13	The donors have agreed, at least for now, to focus on the humanitarian relief effort.
11203	APW_ENG_20080525.0355.LDC2009T13	"We must think about people just now, not politics," Ban told the conference.
11204	APW_ENG_20080525.0355.LDC2009T13	The junta has made it nearly impossible for foreign aid agencies to get access to the Irrawaddy Delta -- where the cyclone damage was worst -- but the country's ruling general promised Ban on Friday that those restrictions would be lifted.
11205	APW_ENG_20080525.0355.LDC2009T13	The government has estimated the economic damage at about US$11 billion (euro7 billion).
11206	APW_ENG_20080525.0355.LDC2009T13	"Their failure to abide by their own law by refusing to release (Suu Kyi) ... is a clear slap in the face to Ban Ki-moon and the ASEAN diplomats and others coming into town," Genser said, referring to the member countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations.
11207	APW_ENG_20080525.0355.LDC2009T13	"They are out of time to hold her under their own law."
11208	APW_ENG_20080525.0355.LDC2009T13	Genser, of U.S.-based Freedom Now, which represents pro-democracy dissidents in a number of countries, said Suu Kyi's house arrest expired at midnight Saturday.
11209	APW_ENG_20080525.0355.LDC2009T13	But Nyan Win, spokesman for her opposition National League of Democracy party, said it would not officially be up until Monday, adding there had been "no sign at all" indicating what the government will do.
11210	APW_ENG_20080525.0355.LDC2009T13	On Saturday, the government held the second phase of a referendum vote for a proposed military-backed constitution that had already won overwhelming support and is largely considered a sham by the international community.
11211	APW_ENG_20080525.0355.LDC2009T13	One provision would prohibit Suu Kyi from holding public office.
11212	APW_ENG_20080525.0355.LDC2009T13	The military refused to accept the results of a general election in 1990 won by her party.
11213	APW_ENG_20080525.0355.LDC2009T13	Suu Kyi has lived under house arrest for about 12 of the past 18 years for leading an internationally hailed movement for democracy in Myanmar, which has been ruled by the military with an iron fist since 1962.

11215	APW_ENG_20080529.0459.LDC2009T13	FRANKFURT, Germany 2008-05-29 10:24:33 UTC
11216	APW_ENG_20080529.0459.LDC2009T13	The proportion of unemployed Germans sank to 7.8 percent in May, the first time the figure has dipped below 8 percent in 15 years, the German Federal Employment Office said Thursday .
11217	APW_ENG_20080529.0459.LDC2009T13	The decline means 131,000 fewer people out of work, bringing the number of unemployed in Europe's biggest economy to 3.283 million.
11218	APW_ENG_20080529.0459.LDC2009T13	While the decline was less than anticipated, the general downward tendency continued, Frank Juergen Weise, director of the office, told a news conference in Nuremberg.
11219	APW_ENG_20080529.0459.LDC2009T13	The overall drop is partially credited to a mild winter in which building projects were able to progress, meaning fewer construction workers had to register for unemployment claims.
11220	APW_ENG_20080529.0459.LDC2009T13	"Employment is growing further and the demand for workers from businesses is moving at a high pace," Weise said.
11221	APW_ENG_20080529.0459.LDC2009T13	Timo Klein, an economist at Global Insight in Frankfurt, said the figure looks poised to continue to decline.
11222	APW_ENG_20080529.0459.LDC2009T13	"Underlying labor market conditions are continuing to improve, thus supporting consumer demand.
11223	APW_ENG_20080529.0459.LDC2009T13	This has remained subdued so far due to inflation fears, but should strengthen once these recede," Klein said.
11224	APW_ENG_20080529.0459.LDC2009T13	Global Insight expects the pace of average monthly declines to pick up again to some degree during the second half of 2008 -- despite the dampening influence from the overall slowdown in economic growth.

11227	APW_ENG_20080530.0455.LDC2009T13	Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki said Friday that the country's economic and security progress shows reconciliation between the nation's feuding factions is almost completed.
11228	APW_ENG_20080530.0455.LDC2009T13	"I'm not saying that Iraq is paradise
11229	APW_ENG_20080530.0455.LDC2009T13	absolutely not," al-Maliki told reporters in Stockholm.
11230	APW_ENG_20080530.0455.LDC2009T13	"There are great challenges.
11231	APW_ENG_20080530.0455.LDC2009T13	But I still would like to say that violent acts have decreased by 80 percent in Iraq."
11232	APW_ENG_20080530.0455.LDC2009T13	His Shiite-dominated government is under pressure to show progress in reconciliation among the country's Sunni Arabs, Shiites and Kurds.
11233	APW_ENG_20080530.0455.LDC2009T13	Iraq's Sunni Arab minority has long felt it is being sidelined by the majority Shiites and the Kurds.
11234	APW_ENG_20080530.0455.LDC2009T13	"We have come nearly to the end of the long process," al-Maliki said at a joint news conference with Swedish Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt.
11235	APW_ENG_20080530.0455.LDC2009T13	"It doesn't mean that everyone gets an equal piece of the pie, but it means that one must show a commitment for a unified, democratic Iraq."
11236	APW_ENG_20080530.0455.LDC2009T13	The largest Sunni Arab political bloc pulled its members out of the Cabinet in August, saying it was not getting enough say in decision-making.
11237	APW_ENG_20080530.0455.LDC2009T13	Sunni politicians have been negotiating a possible return, but suspended talks this week due to a dispute over ministry posts.
11238	APW_ENG_20080530.0455.LDC2009T13	The Iraqi prime minister met Swedish government and industry officials Friday, a day after presenting his country's security and economic progress in the past year to a U.N. conference.
11239	APW_ENG_20080530.0455.LDC2009T13	Al-Maliki said the Iraqi government has earmarked funds to facilitate the "voluntary returns" of Iraqi refugees who have fled to neighboring countries and Europe since the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in 2003.
11240	APW_ENG_20080530.0455.LDC2009T13	That was welcome news to Sweden, which has admitted more than 40,000 Iraqis in five years and is looking for cooperation from Iraqi authorities to send back rejected asylum-seekers.
11241	APW_ENG_20080530.0455.LDC2009T13	"This will take place if we prepare for it, especially when security improves and when work opportunities increase," al- Maliki said.
11242	APW_ENG_20080530.0455.LDC2009T13	"We hope that this is a matter that will have an impact on the development of our relations with European countries and also with neighboring countries."
11243	APW_ENG_20080530.0455.LDC2009T13	Fewer than 1 percent of the 5.1 million Iraqis uprooted from their homes had returned by March 31, according to the International Organization for Migration, an intergovernmental humanitarian group based in Switzerland.
11244	APW_ENG_20080530.0455.LDC2009T13	Up to half the displaced are in neighboring countries, chiefly Jordan and Syria.
11245	APW_ENG_20080530.0455.LDC2009T13	But these countries, feeling overwhelmed, have tightened visa restrictions.

11261	APW_ENG_20080531.0724.LDC2009T13	A weak tropical storm formed Saturday off the Yucatan Peninsula and quickly made landfall at the Belize-Mexico border, dumping rain and kicking up surf.
11262	APW_ENG_20080531.0724.LDC2009T13	The first named storm of the 2008 Atlantic Hurricane Season, Arthur was moving northwest across the Yucatan with maximum sustained winds near 40 mph (64 kph), according to the National Hurricane Center in Miami.
11263	APW_ENG_20080531.0724.LDC2009T13	It formed one day before the official start of the season June 1.
11264	APW_ENG_20080531.0724.LDC2009T13	The storm hit land near the Mexican port city of Chetumal and Belize's Corozal city, dumping rain as far south as Belize City and kicking up strong surf on the popular tourist island of Ambergis Caye.
11265	APW_ENG_20080531.0724.LDC2009T13	Tropical storm warnings were issued for Belize and Mexico's Caribbean coastline.
11266	APW_ENG_20080531.0724.LDC2009T13	In the Mexican state of Quintana Roo, which includes the popular resort of Cancun, ports were closed and all water sports were banned.
11267	APW_ENG_20080531.0724.LDC2009T13	Residents and tourists were encouraged to take precautions in coastal areas, said state Civil Protection Director Carlos Rodriguez Hoy.
11268	APW_ENG_20080531.0724.LDC2009T13	Ports were also closed on the islands of Cozumel and Isla Mujeres and in Chetumal.

11283	APW_ENG_20080702.0418.LDC2009T13	The public hasn't taken to Michelle Obama yet, especially whites.
11284	APW_ENG_20080702.0418.LDC2009T13	And it's got a question about Cindy McCain: Who is she?
11285	APW_ENG_20080702.0418.LDC2009T13	People are divided over whether they like the wife of Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama, with 30 percent seeing her favorably and 35 percent unfavorably, according to an Associated Press-Yahoo News poll released Wednesday.
11286	APW_ENG_20080702.0418.LDC2009T13	They tilt positively toward the spouse of Republican hopeful John McCain, by 27 percent to 17 percent.
11287	APW_ENG_20080702.0418.LDC2009T13	In other words: While the two women are about equally liked, Michelle Obama is twice as disliked as Cindy McCain.
11288	APW_ENG_20080702.0418.LDC2009T13	"Cindy seems like she's laid back and not trying to run her husband," said Linda Kaiser, 60, a Republican and church secretary from Clairton, Pennsylvania.
11289	APW_ENG_20080702.0418.LDC2009T13	"It's nice to have a brain, but they should let their husband be president."
11290	APW_ENG_20080702.0418.LDC2009T13	Whites have an unfavorable view of Michelle Obama by 18 percentage points, while eight in 10 blacks like her.
11291	APW_ENG_20080702.0418.LDC2009T13	That is reminiscent of how Barack Obama fared in the Democratic primaries against Hillary Rodham Clinton.

11299	APW_ENG_20080702.0418.LDC2009T13	One in five had very negative views of her, triple the number who said so about John McCain's wife.
11300	APW_ENG_20080702.0418.LDC2009T13	One in 10 had very favorable views of Michelle Obama, double Cindy McCain's number.

11316	APW_ENG_20080703.0858.LDC2009T13	McCain tours Mexican Catholic shrine, ends journey to promote free-trade with U.S. neighbors
11317	APW_ENG_20080703.0858.LDC2009T13	WASHINGTON 2008-07-03 15:39:49 UTC
11318	APW_ENG_20080703.0858.LDC2009T13	John McCain was discussing the thorny issue of immigration Thursday with Mexican President Felipe Calderon, as the Republican presidential candidate wrapped up a three-day visit to Colombia and Mexico designed to promote free trade and burnish his foreign policy credentials.
11319	APW_ENG_20080703.0858.LDC2009T13	McCain, whose home state of Arizona borders Mexico, began the day at Mexico City's famed Basilica de Guadalupe, the country's holiest site for Catholics.
11320	APW_ENG_20080703.0858.LDC2009T13	Hispanics and Catholics are expected to be key swing voters in the November election against Democrat Barack Obama, who has also worked to woo the same groups.
11321	APW_ENG_20080703.0858.LDC2009T13	The Republican received a blessing from the basilica's monsignor.
11322	APW_ENG_20080703.0858.LDC2009T13	McCain also laid a wreath of white roses at the altar and stood atop the Papal balcony there.
11323	APW_ENG_20080703.0858.LDC2009T13	He was accompanied by President George W. Bush's brother, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, who was visiting Mexico on a business trip.
11324	APW_ENG_20080703.0858.LDC2009T13	McCain was meeting with Calderon to discuss illegal immigration, a key issue for Hispanic voters but a sore subject for many conservative voters who oppose efforts to allow some of the roughly 11 million such immigrants to eventually gain U.S. citizenship.
11325	APW_ENG_20080703.0858.LDC2009T13	McCain backs increased security along the U.S.-Mexico border to block the flow of undocumented workers.
11326	APW_ENG_20080703.0858.LDC2009T13	Both Obama and McCain have been reaching to the center to appeal to undecided moderate voters, who are more likely to be Hispanic, Catholic and married with children than other voters.
11327	APW_ENG_20080703.0858.LDC2009T13	A recent AP-Yahoo News poll finds that 15 percent call themselves moderates and are not solidly supporting a candidate.
11328	APW_ENG_20080703.0858.LDC2009T13	Some 39 percent of voters called themselves Democratic, 29 percent Republican, and 32 percent independent in the June 13-23 survey.
11329	APW_ENG_20080703.0858.LDC2009T13	That Democratic edge suggests Obama may be less dependent on votes in the middle than McCain, but still the likeliest path to the White House cuts through the center of the electorate.
11330	APW_ENG_20080703.0858.LDC2009T13	Obama on Thursday was holding a town hall meeting with veterans in Fargo, North Dakota to discuss better treatment and benefits for military veterans and their families.
11331	APW_ENG_20080703.0858.LDC2009T13	His campaign has focused on patriotic themes leading up to Friday's Independence Day holiday.
11332	APW_ENG_20080703.0858.LDC2009T13	McCain, meanwhile, was unexpectedly put on the defensive at a news conference in Cartagena, Colombia, on Wednesday, when he was forced to respond to a claim by a Republican Senate colleague that the presidential candidate had roughed up an associate of Nicaragua's leftist President Daniel Ortega two decades ago.
11333	APW_ENG_20080703.0858.LDC2009T13	"Simply not true," McCain said of the allegation by Mississippi Republican Sen. Thad Cochran.
11334	APW_ENG_20080703.0858.LDC2009T13	The two have been deeply at odds over federal spending.
11335	APW_ENG_20080703.0858.LDC2009T13	McCain's campaign has been dogged by latent concerns about his hot temper.
11336	APW_ENG_20080703.0858.LDC2009T13	Cochran aide Margaret McPhillips said the senator went into detail about the incident in an interview with a Mississippi newspaper to "make the point that, though Sen. McCain has had problems with his temper, he has overcome them."
11337	APW_ENG_20080703.0858.LDC2009T13	In Colombia, McCain praised the country's conservative president for squeezing drug barons, toured a harbor to watch narcotics interdiction programs and spoke out for free trade agreements with Washington's neighbors in the Western Hemisphere.
11338	APW_ENG_20080703.0858.LDC2009T13	The trade pacts have emerged as a sensitive subject in the U.S., as Americans grapple with soaring energy costs, a crumbling mortgage and housing market and growing unemployment.
11339	APW_ENG_20080703.0858.LDC2009T13	Unimpeded hemispheric trade is an area of sharp contrasts between the presidential rivals, with McCain blasting Obama for opposing existing treaties while leaving himself open to criticism from voters worried about outsourcing of U.S. jobs.
11340	APW_ENG_20080703.0858.LDC2009T13	McCain has promoted himself as better equipped than Obama to deal with foreign policy issues and used his trip to Colombia to press President Alvaro Uribe to work to improve his country's human rights record.
11341	APW_ENG_20080703.0858.LDC2009T13	But he also praised Plan Colombia, a program the U.S. government launched 10 years ago to reduce cocaine production in the country.
11342	APW_ENG_20080703.0858.LDC2009T13	Obama this week has been campaigning on issues meant to combat impressions he is elitist and not patriotic.
11343	APW_ENG_20080703.0858.LDC2009T13	He prodded Americans to greater public service work and promoted the use of additional federal funds to religious groups that tackle social problems.
11344	APW_ENG_20080703.0858.LDC2009T13	On Wednesday the Democrat stood before a boisterous University of Colorado crowd -- in Colorado Springs, a city known as a bastion of conservatism -- and said that the quiet following Friday's Independence Day holiday would be a good time for every person to consider how they can contribute "to our most pressing national challenges" -- whether in the military, overseas or just next door.
11345	APW_ENG_20080703.0858.LDC2009T13	Obama's choice of Christian conservative Colorado Springs for his visit showed the degree to which he is courting Republican religious voters and trying to make McCain compete for their affections.
11346	APW_ENG_20080703.0858.LDC2009T13	The Illinois senator spoke about the expansion of government national service programs, which he first unveiled in December, that would cost $3.5 billion a year.
11347	APW_ENG_20080703.0858.LDC2009T13	His campaign said he would fund the spending with some of the savings from ending the war in Iraq and by canceling a new tax break for multinational corporations.
11348	APW_ENG_20080703.0858.LDC2009T13	Other highlights include increasing the all-volunteer military and doubling the size of the Peace Corps.
11349	APW_ENG_20080703.0858.LDC2009T13	Obama's call echoed George W. Bush's "love a neighbor like you'd like to be loved yourself," an enduring staple of the Republican president's political speeches of the last eight years.
11350	APW_ENG_20080703.0858.LDC2009T13	His campaign said the focus on service was meant not to recall Bush but to reach back to President John F. Kennedy's generation- captivating address that urged Americans to ask what they can do for their country instead of what the U.S. can do for them, or President Bill Clinton's legacy of creating AmeriCorps to tackle U.S. poverty issues.
11351	APW_ENG_20080703.0858.LDC2009T13	Obama also addressed the United Steel Workers union's annual conference in Las Vegas via satellite and burnishing his appeal to the military with a planned visit to the U.S. Air Force Academy and Peterson Air Force Base, both based in Colorado Springs.

11353	APW_ENG_20080706.0397.LDC2009T13	ISLAMABAD, Pakistan 2008-07-06 16:13:04 UTC
11354	APW_ENG_20080706.0397.LDC2009T13	A suicide attacker detonated explosives near a police station in Pakistan's capital on Sunday, killing more than 10 police officers, officials said.
11355	APW_ENG_20080706.0397.LDC2009T13	The evening blast occurred in a kiosk in front of the police station, which is also near Islamabad's Melody Market shopping area, said Naeem Iqbal, a police spokesman.
11356	APW_ENG_20080706.0397.LDC2009T13	Television footage showed wounded security forces being taken away and ambulances rushing to the area.
11357	APW_ENG_20080706.0397.LDC2009T13	Just moments before the explosion, an Associated Press reporter passed by the scene and saw more than 20 security officials gathered nearby.
11358	APW_ENG_20080706.0397.LDC2009T13	After the blast, a traffic intersection in the area was splattered with blood.
11359	APW_ENG_20080706.0397.LDC2009T13	Body parts were scattered as far as 50 yards (meters) from the scene.
11360	APW_ENG_20080706.0397.LDC2009T13	Shattered glass also covered the area, which police cordoned off.
11361	APW_ENG_20080706.0397.LDC2009T13	The blast in the usually tranquil capital came as thousands of Islamists gathered about one-half mile (a kilometer) away to mark the one-year anniversary of a deadly military crackdown on the radical, pro-Taliban Red Mosque.
11362	APW_ENG_20080706.0397.LDC2009T13	But it was not immediately clear if the events were linked, and a mosque official condemned the attack.
11363	APW_ENG_20080706.0397.LDC2009T13	The explosion also came following recent threats of revenge from militants in Pakistan angered by a paramilitary operation against insurgents in the tribal northwest.
11364	APW_ENG_20080706.0397.LDC2009T13	Rana Akbar Hayat, a senior government official, said more than 10 people were killed and "two, three" others were wounded.
11365	APW_ENG_20080706.0397.LDC2009T13	"All are police officials," Hayat told reporters near the scene.
11366	APW_ENG_20080706.0397.LDC2009T13	"It was targeted to the forces by the suicider."
11367	APW_ENG_20080706.0397.LDC2009T13	Interior Ministry chief Rehman Malik said that based on witness accounts, the attacker was a man appearing to be "35-, 37-years- old" who ran into the crowd of police.
11368	APW_ENG_20080706.0397.LDC2009T13	He said police have found the "upper part" of his body but did not give more specifics.
11369	APW_ENG_20080706.0397.LDC2009T13	Malik said the nation has to think "who is destabilizing our country" and take action.
11370	APW_ENG_20080706.0397.LDC2009T13	"We have to take them out from our ranks," he said.
11371	APW_ENG_20080706.0397.LDC2009T13	"We have to combat them."
11372	APW_ENG_20080706.0397.LDC2009T13	Imtiaz Khan, the casualty medical officer at Federal Government Services Hospital, said at least 36 injured people were admitted there, nearly all security officials.
11373	APW_ENG_20080706.0397.LDC2009T13	He said two had died, while 12 were in critical condition.
11374	APW_ENG_20080706.0397.LDC2009T13	Violence levels have fallen in Pakistan since last year, but attacks still occur as resentment continues in some corners against the country's partnership with the U.S. in the war on terror.
11375	APW_ENG_20080706.0397.LDC2009T13	In June, a suicide car bomber killed at least six people near the Danish Embassy in Islamabad.
11376	APW_ENG_20080706.0397.LDC2009T13	A statement attributed to al-Qaida took responsibility for that blast, believed to have targeted Denmark over the publication of cartoons depicting the Prophet Muhammad.
11377	APW_ENG_20080706.0397.LDC2009T13	A new government that came to power following February elections has sought to end militancy in Pakistan primarily through peace deals with extremists.
11378	APW_ENG_20080706.0397.LDC2009T13	That approach has earned criticism from U.S. officials, who say the deals will simply give time for militants to regroup and intensify attacks on foreign forces in neighboring Afghanistan.
11379	APW_ENG_20080706.0397.LDC2009T13	In late June, as militants in Pakistan's northwest increasingly began threatening the key city of Peshawar, the government launched a paramilitary operation in Khyber tribal region to flush out the extremists.
11380	APW_ENG_20080706.0397.LDC2009T13	That operation has now been halted while officials try to negotiate peace through tribal elders, but Pakistani Taliban leaders have vowed revenge for the government's show of force.
11381	APW_ENG_20080706.0397.LDC2009T13	Much of last year's violence came on the heels of the military crackdown on the Red Mosque.
11382	APW_ENG_20080706.0397.LDC2009T13	The siege of the mosque came amid an increasingly violent anti- vice campaign led by the mosque's administrators in which roaming bands of students harassed music and video shops, sometimes kidnapping women accused of being prostitutes.
11383	APW_ENG_20080706.0397.LDC2009T13	Tensions boiled over into gunbattles with security forces trying to enforce government authority.
11384	APW_ENG_20080706.0397.LDC2009T13	The government said 102 people, including 11 security personnel, were killed in the standoff that began July 3 last year.
11385	APW_ENG_20080706.0397.LDC2009T13	The siege seriously undermined the government's reputation among ordinary Pakistanis, many of whom believe far more people died, including women and children.
11386	APW_ENG_20080706.0397.LDC2009T13	A year later, the mosque siege still resonates among militant groups, which have referred to it in videos as a rallying cry.
11387	APW_ENG_20080706.0397.LDC2009T13	Mohammed Amir Siddiq, a spokesman for the Red Mosque, denounced Sunday's suicide attack and said he was not aware if any of those at the anniversary gathering were wounded.
11388	APW_ENG_20080706.0397.LDC2009T13	"This is a very tragic and condemnable incident," Siddiq told The Associated Press.
11389	APW_ENG_20080706.0397.LDC2009T13	He said the mosque held prayers for victims of the bombing after regular evening prayers.
11390	APW_ENG_20080706.0397.LDC2009T13	Kamal Shah, the interior ministry secretary, denied that the bombing was a result of poor security for the Red Mosque gathering, during which many attendees called for Islamic law and demanded the hanging of President Pervez Musharraf.
11391	APW_ENG_20080706.0397.LDC2009T13	Security arrangements made for the anniversary ceremony were "absolutely comprehensive," he said, noting that "nothing happened to the participants of the gathering."

11394	APW_ENG_20080709.0006.LDC2009T13	Mexico City police chief ousted following botched night club raid
11395	APW_ENG_20080709.0006.LDC2009T13	MEXICO CITY 2008-07-09 00:04:34 UTC
11396	APW_ENG_20080709.0006.LDC2009T13	Mexico City's police chief was forced out of office on Tuesday following a botched nightclub raid that resulted in the deaths of 12 people.
11397	APW_ENG_20080709.0006.LDC2009T13	Mayor Marcelo Ebrard said the resignation of Police Chief Joel Ortega was the first step in a plan to "reconstruct" the police force.
11398	APW_ENG_20080709.0006.LDC2009T13	Ortega had held the post since 2004, when he replaced Ebrard -- who was fired in a different police scandal.
11399	APW_ENG_20080709.0006.LDC2009T13	The mayor made the announcement shortly after Mexico City's Human Rights Commission presented a report alleging rampant misconduct by officials in the June 20 raid on the News Divine nightclub that it said "created a death trap."
11400	APW_ENG_20080709.0006.LDC2009T13	A criminal investigation did not find evidence that Ortega had committed any crime, but he has been the target of harsh criticism.
11401	APW_ENG_20080709.0006.LDC2009T13	Ebrard said that he wants to "make major institutional changes" to the city's police department to avoid such tragedies in the future.
11402	APW_ENG_20080709.0006.LDC2009T13	"We have to build a different kind of police force," he said.
11403	APW_ENG_20080709.0006.LDC2009T13	He appointed Health Secretary Manuel Mondragon as interim police chief.
11404	APW_ENG_20080709.0006.LDC2009T13	Officers responding to reports of drugs and underage drinking blocked the club's lone exit, creating a deadly stampede in which nine patrons and three police were asphyxiated or crushed to death.
11405	APW_ENG_20080709.0006.LDC2009T13	Thirty-nine police and borough officials, as well as the club's owner, have been charged in the case.
11406	APW_ENG_20080709.0006.LDC2009T13	The precinct police chief who led the raid, Guillermo Zayas, faces 12 counts of homicide.
11407	APW_ENG_20080709.0006.LDC2009T13	Zayas said in a television interview Tuesday that he's being made a scapegoat.
11408	APW_ENG_20080709.0006.LDC2009T13	The raid showed "systematic abuse, mistreatment and negligence by police," said Emilio Alvarez, president of the city's human rights commission.
11409	APW_ENG_20080709.0006.LDC2009T13	"These acts cannot be seen as isolated events," Alvarez said.
11410	APW_ENG_20080709.0006.LDC2009T13	"They constitute systematic and institutionalized practices, which must be eradicated."
11411	APW_ENG_20080709.0006.LDC2009T13	The human rights commission said police only had one bus to load up the detained youths.
11412	APW_ENG_20080709.0006.LDC2009T13	"The lack of buses motivated the decision to block the exit with a large group of police," causing the youths to pile up in a narrow hallway where many died, the report stated.
11413	APW_ENG_20080709.0006.LDC2009T13	The report said 10 women -- eight of them minors -- were forced to strip for a medical exam, despite the fact they weren't accused of any crime, and their parents weren't notified or asked for consent.
11414	APW_ENG_20080709.0006.LDC2009T13	Alvarez quoted one of the women as saying "not even my mother sees me nude.
11415	APW_ENG_20080709.0006.LDC2009T13	Why should other people see me?"
11416	APW_ENG_20080709.0006.LDC2009T13	A male police officer was allegedly present during the exams.
11417	APW_ENG_20080709.0006.LDC2009T13	City prosecutor Rodolfo Felix Cardenas also offered his resignation on Tuesday, but Ebrard did not say if he would accept it.
11418	APW_ENG_20080709.0006.LDC2009T13	Ebrard himself was fired as Mexico City police chief in 2004 when his force was accused of dawdling while a mob seized, beat and burned to death two federal police officers.
11419	APW_ENG_20080709.0006.LDC2009T13	The club's owner faces charges of involuntary homicide for allegedly overcrowding the club and blocking emergency exits.
11420	APW_ENG_20080709.0006.LDC2009T13	He also is charged with corruption of minors for allegedly allowing youths to drink.

11427	APW_ENG_20080711.0235.LDC2009T13	The frozen remains of two woolly mammoths -- long extinct Ice Age elephants -- went on display Friday in Taiwan.
11428	APW_ENG_20080711.0235.LDC2009T13	One specimen nicknamed "Oymiakon" -- believed to be a 1-year-old female that lived between 28,000 B.C. and 38,000 B.C. -- was being shown outside Russia for the first time since its discovery in the Siberian permafrost in 2004, organizers said.
11429	APW_ENG_20080711.0235.LDC2009T13	Only her tusk-less head was uncovered, and the rest of the remains may have decomposed or were eaten by other animals, said zoologist Lin Chun-tsong.
11430	APW_ENG_20080711.0235.LDC2009T13	The second mammoth, called "Yukagir," a 40-year-old male that lived around 18,000 B.C., is complete with two long curving tusks, hairy head and part of a leg.
11431	APW_ENG_20080711.0235.LDC2009T13	It was first seen by the public at Japan's Aichi Expo in 2005, after being excavated in 2002.

11438	APW_ENG_20080711.0409.LDC2009T13	"Probably the strongest team we've ever sent to the Olympic Games," Thornton said Thursday while reflecting on the wild U.S. Olympic trials that wrapped up last week.
11439	APW_ENG_20080711.0409.LDC2009T13	"I feel really good about this team."
11440	APW_ENG_20080711.0409.LDC2009T13	The trials produced a mixed bag of strong performances, upsets and suspenseful moments.
11441	APW_ENG_20080711.0409.LDC2009T13	Tyson Gay, the defending world champion in the 100 and 200 meters, will go to the Olympics in the first event but not the second after a hamstring injury sent him tumbling to the track in 200 qualifying.
11442	APW_ENG_20080711.0409.LDC2009T13	Defending Olympic champion and former "Mr. Invincible" in the 400 meters Jeremy Wariner lost in the final to LaShawn Merritt for the second time this year.
11443	APW_ENG_20080711.0409.LDC2009T13	One could look at Wariner as slipping or the U.S. just getting stronger.
11444	APW_ENG_20080711.0409.LDC2009T13	Gay has said he'll be ready for the 100 and Thornton said he has no reason to doubt him.
11445	APW_ENG_20080711.0409.LDC2009T13	Thornton said he's checking on Gay's progress by staying in regular touch with Gay's personal coach Jon Drummond.
11446	APW_ENG_20080711.0409.LDC2009T13	On a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being the worst, Thornton suggested Gay's hamstring ranked no higher than a 3.
11447	APW_ENG_20080711.0409.LDC2009T13	Any sprinter should be taking at least a week off after the rigorous ordeal of a meet like the U.S. trials, so Gay shouldn't be hampered, Thornton said.
11448	APW_ENG_20080711.0409.LDC2009T13	"I'm expecting him back when they say 'to your marks.'
11449	APW_ENG_20080711.0409.LDC2009T13	I have great confidence in the people around him," Thornton said.
11450	APW_ENG_20080711.0409.LDC2009T13	Even with his confidence in the team from top to bottom, Thornton didn't want to predict a medal haul for a country that typically dominates the track.
11451	APW_ENG_20080711.0409.LDC2009T13	"My medal count goal is that at the end of the day, when 91,000 people leave that stadium, they've heard our national anthem so many times that they're humming it on their way out the door," Thornton said.
11452	APW_ENG_20080711.0409.LDC2009T13	The United States topped the track and field medal table at the 2004 Athens Olympics with a total of 25.
11453	APW_ENG_20080711.0409.LDC2009T13	That was the country's largest haul since taking home 30 medals from the track at the 1992 Barcelona Summer Games.
11454	APW_ENG_20080711.0409.LDC2009T13	Thornton, who is also the track coach at the University of Texas, acknowledged the U.S. team will have to make adjustments when competing in China, from travel, to culture to time changes.
11455	APW_ENG_20080711.0409.LDC2009T13	He also knows athletes will be concerned about the air quality in Beijing, one of the world's most polluted cities.
11456	APW_ENG_20080711.0409.LDC2009T13	Thornton said they'll have to adjust.
11457	APW_ENG_20080711.0409.LDC2009T13	"We've all been concerned about the air quality.
11458	APW_ENG_20080711.0409.LDC2009T13	They all know it is what it is.
11459	APW_ENG_20080711.0409.LDC2009T13	It's going to be a change and it might be a negative.
11460	APW_ENG_20080711.0409.LDC2009T13	How big of a negative do we want to let it be?
11461	APW_ENG_20080711.0409.LDC2009T13	How much do we want it to effect us?"
11462	APW_ENG_20080711.0409.LDC2009T13	Thornton said.
11463	APW_ENG_20080711.0409.LDC2009T13	"I was over there for seven days last summer and I've been in (Los Angeles) when it was worse," he said.

11467	APW_ENG_20080712.0479.LDC2009T13	Unknown gunmen shot and killed two Somali aid workers and wounded a third within 24 hours, witnesses said Saturday, in the latest sign of spiraling violence against workers struggling to deal with the war-ravaged country's humanitarian crisis.
11468	APW_ENG_20080712.0479.LDC2009T13	The shootings all occurred within a few hours of each other on Friday.
11469	APW_ENG_20080712.0479.LDC2009T13	Two men were shot in separate incidents about 8 miles (13 kilometers) from the capital of Mogadishu.
11470	APW_ENG_20080712.0479.LDC2009T13	One, who worked for an aid organization affiliated with the U.N.'s World Food Program, is in serious condition.
11471	APW_ENG_20080712.0479.LDC2009T13	The other, Mohamed Mohamud Qeyre, died, said colleague Ahmed Mo'alim.
11472	APW_ENG_20080712.0479.LDC2009T13	Qeyre was the deputy director of local aid group Daryeel Bulsho Guud, which is affiliated to the German organization Bread for the World.
11473	APW_ENG_20080712.0479.LDC2009T13	"Two men shot him three times in the head and the ribs," said Mo'alim.
11474	APW_ENG_20080712.0479.LDC2009T13	In a third incident, local clan elder Ahmed Shire Yabar says aid worker Mohamud Ahmed Roble was killed in Galharei town in central Somalia.
11475	APW_ENG_20080712.0479.LDC2009T13	He said Saturday he did not know the name of the organization the victim worked for.
11476	APW_ENG_20080712.0479.LDC2009T13	"He was going to a mosque and he stepped out of his home
11477	APW_ENG_20080712.0479.LDC2009T13	two men armed with pistols shot him four times and escaped.
11478	APW_ENG_20080712.0479.LDC2009T13	He died on the spot," said Yabar.
11479	APW_ENG_20080712.0479.LDC2009T13	Violence against aid workers in Somalia has dramatically increased in the past few weeks.
11480	APW_ENG_20080712.0479.LDC2009T13	One senior Somali aid worker for the U.N. was kidnapped last month, and another shot dead July 6.
11481	APW_ENG_20080712.0479.LDC2009T13	A driver for the U.N. World Food Program was killed at a checkpoint on Monday, and Friday's shootings brings the total number of aid workers shot this week to five.
11482	APW_ENG_20080712.0479.LDC2009T13	It is unclear who is behind the killings, since many factions in Somalia's chaotic war stand to benefit from them.
11483	APW_ENG_20080712.0479.LDC2009T13	Powerful local leaders have previously complained that aid workers are feeding Islamic insurgents who had sworn to fight the government, and insurgents have also targeted Somalis affiliated with foreign organizations in the past.
11484	APW_ENG_20080712.0479.LDC2009T13	The problem has been compounded by the growth of professional kidnapping rings, who security experts say have been encouraged by the large cash ransoms paid by foreigners to release ships taken by pirates.
11485	APW_ENG_20080712.0479.LDC2009T13	The Islamists vowed to fight an Iraq-style war against the government and its Ethiopian allies in December 2006, after Ethiopian troops dislodged the Islamists from the capital and much of the territory in southern Somalia they had held for the previous six months.
11486	APW_ENG_20080712.0479.LDC2009T13	Thousands of civilians have been killed in the fighting and hundreds of thousands have fled the capital.
11487	APW_ENG_20080712.0479.LDC2009T13	Over 2 million people in the arid, impoverished country are dependent on food aid.
11488	APW_ENG_20080712.0479.LDC2009T13	Control of aid, used to buy loyalty from militiamen, has often provoked fighting among Somalia's powerful clan-based warlords since they toppled a socialist dictator in 1991.
11489	APW_ENG_20080712.0479.LDC2009T13	The country has not had a functioning government since then.

11491	APW_ENG_20080715.0390.LDC2009T13	ANKARA, Turkey 2008-07-15 09:42:08 UTC
11492	APW_ENG_20080715.0390.LDC2009T13	Turkey's military says 22 Kurdish rebels have been killed in recent clashes in southeastern Turkey.
11493	APW_ENG_20080715.0390.LDC2009T13	The military says the clashes occurred in the rugged Sirnak province.
11494	APW_ENG_20080715.0390.LDC2009T13	A statement on the military's Web site says aircraft and artillery units shelled rebel positions in the area between Friday and Monday, killing 22 rebels.
11495	APW_ENG_20080715.0390.LDC2009T13	It says the military units also destroyed rebel shelters in the region.
11496	APW_ENG_20080715.0390.LDC2009T13	The military says all units have returned to their units but does not cite any military casualty.
11497	APW_ENG_20080715.0390.LDC2009T13	The rebels have been fighting for more than two decades for autonomy in southeastern Turkey.

11499	APW_ENG_20080721.0693.LDC2009T13	Singapore says will study kidney donor payments to meet demand for transplants
11500	APW_ENG_20080721.0693.LDC2009T13	SINGAPORE 2008-07-21 14:11:18 UTC
11501	APW_ENG_20080721.0693.LDC2009T13	Singapore will study the possibility of paying some kidney donors to help meet demand for kidney transplants, the city-state's health minister said Monday.
11502	APW_ENG_20080721.0693.LDC2009T13	The Health Ministry will examine the feasibility of providing payments to unrelated donors to augment the supply of kidneys, Khaw Boon Wan said in Parliament, acknowledging that the suggestion has stirred controversy.
11503	APW_ENG_20080721.0693.LDC2009T13	"We should not reject any idea just because it is radical or controversial," Khaw said.
11504	APW_ENG_20080721.0693.LDC2009T13	"We may be able to find an acceptable way to allow a meaningful compensation for some living, unrelated kidney donors, without breaching ethical principles or hurting the sensitivities of others."
11505	APW_ENG_20080721.0693.LDC2009T13	Khaw said the ministry would review possible changes to current legislation to allow payments for donations from third parties such as those from the charity and religious sectors.
11506	APW_ENG_20080721.0693.LDC2009T13	Such a change would need to be approved by Parliament to become law.
11507	APW_ENG_20080721.0693.LDC2009T13	"There are desperate patients out there wishing to live and desperately poor people willing to exchange a kidney for a hopefully improved life," he said.
11508	APW_ENG_20080721.0693.LDC2009T13	"Criminalizing organ trading does not eliminate it ... it merely breeds a black market."
11509	APW_ENG_20080721.0693.LDC2009T13	Khaw said the Health Ministry would also push to amend existing laws on organ transplants to remove an age limit on deceased donors, currently set at 60 years, because "the suitability of the organ depends on its condition rather than the age of the donor."
11510	APW_ENG_20080721.0693.LDC2009T13	The Health Ministry will look into matching patients with donors by setting up a registry of possible donors, he said.
11511	APW_ENG_20080721.0693.LDC2009T13	The two initiatives should enable Singapore to carry out 70 percent of the kidney transplants needed every year -- up from 50 percent currently, the minister said.
11512	APW_ENG_20080721.0693.LDC2009T13	He said about 1,000 new cases of kidney failure are diagnosed every year, with nearly 40 percent unable to survive the first year.
11513	APW_ENG_20080721.0693.LDC2009T13	Khaw's comments follow the cases of two Indonesian men who were jailed and fined by a Singapore court earlier this month after being convicted of agreeing to sell their kidneys to two patients in the city-state.
11514	APW_ENG_20080721.0693.LDC2009T13	Selling or buying organs or blood is illegal in Singapore, as in many other countries, and carries a penalty of up to 12 months' jail, or a fine of up to 10,000 Singapore dollars (US$7,405), or both.

11516	APW_ENG_20080730.0245.LDC2009T13	KABUL, Afghanistan 2008-07-30 06:06:55 UTC
11517	APW_ENG_20080730.0245.LDC2009T13	A NATO soldier died from wounds suffered in an attack in southern Afghanistan, while insurgents and a roadside blast killed five Afghan policemen elsewhere in the country, officials said Wednesday.
11518	APW_ENG_20080730.0245.LDC2009T13	The NATO soldier was wounded after insurgents attacked his convoy in southern Helmand province on Tuesday, the military alliance said in a statement.
11519	APW_ENG_20080730.0245.LDC2009T13	It did not release the soldier's nationality.
11520	APW_ENG_20080730.0245.LDC2009T13	Also Tuesday, a roadside bomb that apparently targeted an Afghan senator mediating a land dispute in eastern Paktia province's Dand Wa Pathan district killed three policemen and wounded three others, said Ruhollah Samoon, spokesman for the provincial governor.
11521	APW_ENG_20080730.0245.LDC2009T13	The politician, Wakil Mohammad Laheq, escaped unhurt.
11522	APW_ENG_20080730.0245.LDC2009T13	Meanwhile, militants attacked a police van, killing two officers and stealing their vehicle in Logar province on Tuesday, said Gen. Mohammad Mustafa Khan, provincial chief of police.
11523	APW_ENG_20080730.0245.LDC2009T13	The attack occurred in the Niyazi area.
11524	APW_ENG_20080730.0245.LDC2009T13	Logar is just south of Kabul province, Khan said.
11525	APW_ENG_20080730.0245.LDC2009T13	More than 2,700 people -- mostly militants -- have died in insurgency-related violence this year in Afghanistan, according to an Associated Press tally of figures provided by Afghan and Western officials.
11526	APW_ENG_20080730.0245.LDC2009T13	Insurgent attacks are reported to have risen by 50 percent so far this year compared to 2007.
11527	APW_ENG_20080730.0832.LDC2009T13	England 173-6 against SA in 3rd test
11528	APW_ENG_20080730.0832.LDC2009T13	BIRMINGHAM, England 2008-07-30 15:29:09 UTC
11529	APW_ENG_20080730.0832.LDC2009T13	England struggled at 173-6 against South Africa at tea on the opening day of the third test Wednesday, with captain Michael Vaughan and Paul Collingwood again failing with the bat.
11530	APW_ENG_20080730.0832.LDC2009T13	Andrew Flintoff (4) and Tim Ambrose (0) were the unbeaten batsmen at the interval as the home side wilted against high quality fast bowling.
11531	APW_ENG_20080730.0832.LDC2009T13	Alastair Cook (76), Collingwood (4) and Ian Bell (50) were the three wickets to fall after lunch.
11532	APW_ENG_20080730.0832.LDC2009T13	Bell fell to Makhaya Ntini in the penultimate over before tea to leave England reeling after winning the toss and electing to bat.
11533	APW_ENG_20080730.0832.LDC2009T13	Resuming at 82-3 after lunch, Cook and Bell took their fourth- wicket partnership to 62 before Cook edged his former Essex team mate Andre Nel to Jacques Kallis at second slip.
11534	APW_ENG_20080730.0832.LDC2009T13	Collingwood, recalled to the side after being dropped for the second test, took 16 balls to get off the mark before edging Kallis to Graeme Smith at slip.
11535	APW_ENG_20080730.0832.LDC2009T13	Bell reached his 19th test 50 from 94 deliveries with a cover drive, but was out just before tea when he edged behind to Mark Boucher off Ntini.
11536	APW_ENG_20080730.0832.LDC2009T13	Earlier, England had looked comfortable on 68-0 after winning the toss and electing to bat.
11537	APW_ENG_20080730.0832.LDC2009T13	But they lost Andrew Strauss (20) and Vaughan without scoring in successive deliveries as Nel made an immediate impact in his first test of the series.
11538	APW_ENG_20080730.0832.LDC2009T13	Strauss made the mistake of moving too deep into his crease and treading on his stumps while attempting to flick the ball away in the 23rd over.
11539	APW_ENG_20080730.0832.LDC2009T13	Nel, who replaced the injured Dale Steyn, then removed Vaughan when he played forward and sent a catch behind to Boucher.
11540	APW_ENG_20080730.0832.LDC2009T13	England lost Kevin Pietersen just before lunch, caught by Ashwell Prince at backward point off the bowling of Kallis.
11541	APW_ENG_20080730.0832.LDC2009T13	Television replays suggested that Pietersen had missed the ball while trying to whip it through midwicket, but should have been given out leg before wicket as it crashed into his pad.
11542	APW_ENG_20080730.0832.LDC2009T13	South Africa captain Graeme Smith was passed fit, so Nel was the visitors' only change.
11543	APW_ENG_20080730.0832.LDC2009T13	England brought back Ryan Sidebottom and Collingwood to replace Darren Pattinson and Stuart Broad.
11544	APW_ENG_20080730.0832.LDC2009T13	England lost the second test at Headingley by 10 wickets and is 1-0 down in the four match series.
11545	APW_ENG_20080801.0313.LDC2009T13	Oil price rise hits British Airways Q1 profits
11546	APW_ENG_20080801.0313.LDC2009T13	LONDON 2008-08-01 07:12:56 UTC
11547	APW_ENG_20080801.0313.LDC2009T13	British Airways PLC reported a huge fall in its first quarter earnings on Friday, as chief executive Willie Walsh said a combination of soaring oil prices and a global economic slowdown presented "the worst trading environment the industry has ever faced."
11548	APW_ENG_20080801.0313.LDC2009T13	BA also announced cuts to its winter flight schedule in a bid to reign in spending in the tough trading climate -- cuts that led the carrier to trim its full-year forecast for revenue growth to 3 percent, instead of 4 percent.
11549	APW_ENG_20080801.0313.LDC2009T13	In a trading update, BA said that its pretax profit in the three months to June 30 was 37 million pounds (US$73 million) -- an 88 percent plunge from the 298 million pounds it earned in the same period a year ago.
11550	APW_ENG_20080801.0313.LDC2009T13	Total revenue was up 2.8 percent over the period, but weaker consumer confidence meant that planes over the quarter traveled 73.4 percent full -- a 3.4 percent drop from the same period last year.
11551	APW_ENG_20080801.0313.LDC2009T13	"We are in the worst trading environment the industry has ever faced," said BA chief executive Willie Walsh.
11552	APW_ENG_20080801.0313.LDC2009T13	"The combination of unprecedented oil prices, economic slowdown and weaker consumer confidence has led to substantially lower first quarter profits."
11553	APW_ENG_20080801.0313.LDC2009T13	BA said its fuel bill surged 49 percent over the quarter and Walsh warned that flight ticket prices would have to rise across the industry as the hedging positions against high oil prices put in place by most airlines begin to unwind.
11554	APW_ENG_20080801.0313.LDC2009T13	"It is absolutely unavoidable that as hedging unwinds we will have to reflect the significant increase in the price of oil in our fares," Walsh said.
11555	APW_ENG_20080801.0313.LDC2009T13	Walsh added that BA's planned merger with Spanish carrier Iberia SA was a positive step for both carriers "particularly against the background of the industry outlook."
11556	APW_ENG_20080801.0313.LDC2009T13	Asked about job losses, Walsh said combining the two airlines in the current economic climate would make BA and Iberia "much stronger."
11557	APW_ENG_20080801.0313.LDC2009T13	"If people are concerned about jobs, that can only be good news," he said.
11558	APW_ENG_20080801.0313.LDC2009T13	Walsh said the airline had revised its capital expenditure plans to focus on cost control, but said that it had ordered six new Boeing 777-300ER aircraft for delivery beginning in 2010.
11559	APW_ENG_20080801.0313.LDC2009T13	The new Boeing aircraft are 23 percent more fuel efficient than the Boeing 747-400s in BA's current fleet and will give the airline additional flexibility in the longhaul fleet.
11560	APW_ENG_20080801.0313.LDC2009T13	"We see new fuel efficient aircraft as being a critical part of the answer to high oil prices," Walsh said.

11563	APW_ENG_20080801.0528.LDC2009T13	NEW YORK 2008-08-01 11:43:47 UTC
11564	APW_ENG_20080801.0528.LDC2009T13	IndyMac Bancorp, the California mortgage insurer seized last month by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., says it will file for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection.
11565	APW_ENG_20080801.0528.LDC2009T13	In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Indymac says it expects the court will appoint a bankruptcy trustee promptly.
11566	APW_ENG_20080801.0528.LDC2009T13	Upon the takeover of IndyMac Bank by the FDIC, it became the largest regulated thrift, a type of bank that focuses largely on mortgages and consumer loans, to fail.
11567	APW_ENG_20080801.0528.LDC2009T13	The seizure prompted hundreds of angry customers to queue up for hours in Southern California to demand their money.
11568	APW_ENG_20080801.0528.LDC2009T13	IndyMac's customers had to take a loss on whatever amount they had in the bank over the $100,000 insurance limits.
11569	APW_ENG_20080801.0528.LDC2009T13	About 10,000 of IndyMac's 275,000 accounts contained uninsured sums, and uninsured money made up about $1 billion of the bank's $19 billion in deposits.

11571	APW_ENG_20080803.0022.LDC2009T13	JAKARTA, Indonesia 2008-08-03 00:12:42 UTC
11572	APW_ENG_20080803.0022.LDC2009T13	It took a half century and YouTube to bring Indonesia's rock 'n' roll legends back home.
11573	APW_ENG_20080803.0022.LDC2009T13	Andy Tielman and his three brothers left for Europe in 1957, where they packed clubs and stadiums with their high-energy shows, tossing guitars across the stage, plucking strings with their teeth and playing while perched on top of the standing bass.
11574	APW_ENG_20080803.0022.LDC2009T13	But while some music critics say the Tielman Brothers' rapid-fire Les Paul riffs and rough interpretations of country-western helped shape the sound of a generation, most fans in their native Indonesia only learned about them this year.
11575	APW_ENG_20080803.0022.LDC2009T13	A story in the local version of Rolling Stone magazine sent curious readers to YouTube, where they could hardly believe their eyes: "Insane !!!!!"
11576	APW_ENG_20080803.0022.LDC2009T13	a new fan wrote on one site.
11577	APW_ENG_20080803.0022.LDC2009T13	And "why did I never hear of these guys?"
11578	APW_ENG_20080803.0022.LDC2009T13	When Andy, now 72, returned to Indonesia for the first time to perform this month, hundreds turned out to twist the night away, calling out for old headliners written before most of them were born and snapping pictures with their mobile phones.
11579	APW_ENG_20080803.0022.LDC2009T13	"Magnificent!
11580	APW_ENG_20080803.0022.LDC2009T13	Fabulous!
11581	APW_ENG_20080803.0022.LDC2009T13	He TOTALLY rocks!"
11582	APW_ENG_20080803.0022.LDC2009T13	gushed Nada Yangrifqi, a 22-year-old college student, after watching Tielman play alongside an Indonesian band.
11583	APW_ENG_20080803.0022.LDC2009T13	"I'm so proud!"
11584	APW_ENG_20080803.0022.LDC2009T13	Andy, Reggy, Ponthon and Loulou Tielman were born to a Dutch- Indonesian father and German-Arab mother on the eastern island of Sulawesi during the final years of Holland's centuries-long colonial rule.
11585	APW_ENG_20080803.0022.LDC2009T13	The boys, then 9 to 14, started out playing before family and friends.
11586	APW_ENG_20080803.0022.LDC2009T13	Before long, they were going city-to-city with their banjos, drums, guitars and bass, playing mostly folk songs.
11587	APW_ENG_20080803.0022.LDC2009T13	Often their little sister, Jane, joined them on stage dancing.
11588	APW_ENG_20080803.0022.LDC2009T13	"These were the happiest moments in my life," Andy, one of two surviving brothers, said at an emotional post-gig press conference in Jakarta, the Indonesian capital.
11589	APW_ENG_20080803.0022.LDC2009T13	"It was fun when we were older, too, of course.
11590	APW_ENG_20080803.0022.LDC2009T13	But when I was a child, with my brothers, that was really something."
11591	APW_ENG_20080803.0022.LDC2009T13	Soon after Indonesia formally became independent in 1949, the country's first president, the fiery Sukarno, condemned rock 'n' roll as a symptom of Western decadence.
11592	APW_ENG_20080803.0022.LDC2009T13	The Tielmans reluctantly left for Holland, settling in the small, southern city of Breda.
11593	APW_ENG_20080803.0022.LDC2009T13	Though already falling under the influence of Elvis Presley, Chuck Berry, Bill Haley and others, Andy said he and his brothers knew they had to be more than imitators and created a sound and style that came to be known as Indo Rock by some -- by others, pure R&amp
11594	APW_ENG_20080803.0022.LDC2009T13	R.
11595	APW_ENG_20080803.0022.LDC2009T13	"We started playing country-western but my brother Loulou, who played the drums, complained because there nothing for him to do," he said, pounding the table as he belted out "Hey Good Lookin'."
11596	APW_ENG_20080803.0022.LDC2009T13	"See?
11597	APW_ENG_20080803.0022.LDC2009T13	Load drums to that and you get rock and roll."
11598	APW_ENG_20080803.0022.LDC2009T13	Andy, the band's lead guitarist and singer, introduced many changes of his own.
11599	APW_ENG_20080803.0022.LDC2009T13	He decided his Gibson was too heavy for stage throwing and switched to a lighter Olympic White Jazzmaster, which he converted from six to 10 strings, using a hot nail to drill extra holes into the headstock.
11600	APW_ENG_20080803.0022.LDC2009T13	He added four much-thinner banjo strings, creating a sought-after tighter, deeper sound that many others later mimicked.
11601	APW_ENG_20080803.0022.LDC2009T13	The boys went to Brussels and soon after Germany, where they became an overnight sensation, selling out concert halls and appearing on live TV.
11602	APW_ENG_20080803.0022.LDC2009T13	Next came Israel, where they became among the first musicians ever to perform in a football stadium, a 45,000-seater.
11603	APW_ENG_20080803.0022.LDC2009T13	Asked if the Tielman Brothers left their mark on the Beatles and the Rolling Stones, as his fans so often claim, Andy said: "I know John Lennon, then playing backup for the Tony Sheridan band, saw us perform, a lot of the British did.
11604	APW_ENG_20080803.0022.LDC2009T13	But I'd never dare say we influenced them."
11605	APW_ENG_20080803.0022.LDC2009T13	The rocker returned to Indonesia at the invitation of the Jakarta Rock Parade organizers -- a 100-band, three-day extravaganza that wrapped up July 13.
11606	APW_ENG_20080803.0022.LDC2009T13	Dressed in black with colored spotlights setting his long gray hair ablaze, he played "Rock Little Baby of Mine," which in January was officially recognized as Holland's first-ever rock 'n roll song (1958).
11607	APW_ENG_20080803.0022.LDC2009T13	That accolade got the Tielman Brothers their first press coverage in Indonesia -- the article in Rolling Stone.
11608	APW_ENG_20080803.0022.LDC2009T13	He went on to play "Little Bird," "Rollin' Rock" and "Beethoven Rock," as well as the classics of others: "Blue Suede Shoes," "One Night," and "Oh My Love, My Darling."
11609	APW_ENG_20080803.0022.LDC2009T13	But there was no strumming the guitar over his head or with his toes -- things he said were better left to the young.
11610	APW_ENG_20080803.0022.LDC2009T13	When Andy finally got around to his last song, a national favorite, "Rajuan Pulau Kelapa" or "Coconut Tree Serenade," it was well past 1 a.m.
11611	APW_ENG_20080803.0022.LDC2009T13	But neither he nor his audience wanted to see the night end, swaying gently as they sang together, their hands raised to the sky.
11612	APW_ENG_20080803.0022.LDC2009T13	For Andy it was an emotional return.
11613	APW_ENG_20080803.0022.LDC2009T13	He said he felt honored to be invited back for his music -- something he never dreamed would happen -- and hoped to find a way to return soon.
11614	APW_ENG_20080803.0022.LDC2009T13	"I feel I'm at home," he said, accompanied by his wife and 12 -year-old daughter.
11615	APW_ENG_20080803.0022.LDC2009T13	His only remaining sibling, Reggy, is 75 and no longer able to perform.
11616	APW_ENG_20080803.0022.LDC2009T13	"My only regret," he said, "is that my brothers couldn't be here with me."

11622	APW_ENG_20080804.0029.LDC2009T13	ISLAMABAD, Pakistan 2008-08-04 00:46:15 UTC
11623	APW_ENG_20080804.0029.LDC2009T13	At least nine climbers were feared dead on K-2, the world's second-highest mountain, after an avalanche cut ropes used to cross a treacherous wall of ice, officials and other climbers said Sunday.
11624	APW_ENG_20080804.0029.LDC2009T13	Several other mountaineers were missing, prompting a desperate rescue effort on the peak in northern Pakistan, which is regarded as more dangerous to climb than Mount Everest.
11625	APW_ENG_20080804.0029.LDC2009T13	A total of 22 people, mostly foreigners, in eight different groups scaled K-2's summit on Friday, said Nazir Sabir of the Alpine Club of Pakistan.
11626	APW_ENG_20080804.0029.LDC2009T13	As they made their way down, an avalanche carried away ropes fixed 1,148 feet (350 meters) below the peak, sweeping some climbers to their deaths and stranding others at a height where they would likely succumb to exposure, Sabir said.
11627	APW_ENG_20080804.0029.LDC2009T13	Accounts varied on the number of dead and how they died.
11628	APW_ENG_20080804.0029.LDC2009T13	Sabir said nine people died in the avalanche.
11629	APW_ENG_20080804.0029.LDC2009T13	Included in that number, were two rescuers -- a Nepalese sherpa and a Pakistani porter -- who survivors said fell to their death.
11630	APW_ENG_20080804.0029.LDC2009T13	Mohammed Akram, vice president of the Adventure Foundation of Pakistan, a nonprofit organization, said one rescue team dispatched Sunday had reached a Dutchman and an Italian suffering from frostbite and were helping them down toward a camp at an altitude of 21,325 feet (6,500 meters).
11631	APW_ENG_20080804.0029.LDC2009T13	He said helicopter crews spotted survivors, but could not pluck them to safety because the air is too thin for them to operate so high.
11632	APW_ENG_20080804.0029.LDC2009T13	The fixed rope lines were strung across a point on the mountain known as "The Bottleneck."
11633	APW_ENG_20080804.0029.LDC2009T13	Chris Warner, an American who climbed K-2 last year, said it was the deadliest place on the mountain, the fall from there down the south face is some 9,000 feet (2,740 meters).
11634	APW_ENG_20080804.0029.LDC2009T13	"You can see how for people who were exhausted, it would have been nearly impossible for them to descend without the ropes," said Warner.
11635	APW_ENG_20080804.0029.LDC2009T13	He said hope was fading for anyone still alive and separated from their group.
11636	APW_ENG_20080804.0029.LDC2009T13	"Once their hands and feet are frozen, they really are unable to move on their own power, and it takes other people to carry them down," he said.
11637	APW_ENG_20080804.0029.LDC2009T13	At 28,250 feet (8,610 meters), K-2 stands about 785 feet (240 meters) below Mount Everest, but is a "phenomenally dangerous mountain," said Alan Arnett, who climbed a nearby peak with at least one of the missing climbers.
11638	APW_ENG_20080804.0029.LDC2009T13	Compared with Everest, "it's more technical, it's steeper, the weather is more intense," he said.
11639	APW_ENG_20080804.0029.LDC2009T13	The toll from the avalanche was the highest from a single incident on K-2 since at least 1995, when seven climbers died after being caught in a fierce storm.
11640	APW_ENG_20080804.0029.LDC2009T13	About 280 people have summited K-2 since 1954, when it was first conquered by Italians Achille Compagnoni and Lino Lacedell.
11641	APW_ENG_20080804.0029.LDC2009T13	Dozens of deaths have been recorded since 1939, most of them occurring during the descent.

11646	APW_ENG_20080808.0239.LDC2009T13	China Eastern Airlines saw its shares tumble 3.7 percent early Friday following reports that it would not resume talks with Singapore Airlines about a possible stake sale.
11647	APW_ENG_20080808.0239.LDC2009T13	The Shanghai-based airline's board secretary, Luo Zhuping, refused comment on the reports that the two sides were not planning further talks before an earlier agreement between them expires on Saturday.
11648	APW_ENG_20080808.0239.LDC2009T13	"Don't believe any reporters' guesses.
11649	APW_ENG_20080808.0239.LDC2009T13	What I can guarantee you is that we would make an official announcement if any decision comes," Luo said.
11650	APW_ENG_20080808.0239.LDC2009T13	Like many in China, Luo's focus was on the big event of the day -- the opening of the Beijing Olympic games Friday evening.
11651	APW_ENG_20080808.0239.LDC2009T13	"Besides, I don't want to comment on it during the Olympics," he added.
11652	APW_ENG_20080808.0239.LDC2009T13	China Eastern agreed last year to sell a 24 percent stake to Singapore Airlines and Temasek Holdings, the Singaporean government investment arm.
11653	APW_ENG_20080808.0239.LDC2009T13	That deal was rejected by China Eastern's minority shareholders after state-owned China National Aviation Holding Co., parent company of Beijing's flag carrier Air China, offered more money.
11654	APW_ENG_20080808.0239.LDC2009T13	But that deal was not completed either.
11655	APW_ENG_20080808.0239.LDC2009T13	Reports last week said that China Eastern and the Singaporean consortium planned to resume talks.
11656	APW_ENG_20080808.0239.LDC2009T13	A Singapore Airlines spokesman confirmed that the two airlines, which have other cooperative arrangements, were in contact.
11657	APW_ENG_20080808.0239.LDC2009T13	China Eastern's shares were at 7.34 yuan by midday Friday, down 3.7 percent.
11658	APW_ENG_20080808.0239.LDC2009T13	Other airlines' shares also tumbled amid a raft of negative news about the worldwide airline industry, which is struggling with high fuel prices and slackening passenger demand.
11659	APW_ENG_20080808.0239.LDC2009T13	Air China fell 4.2 percent to 9.25 yuan in morning trading.
11660	APW_ENG_20080808.0239.LDC2009T13	China Southern Airlines lost 3.6 percent to 7.24 yuan.
11661	APW_ENG_20080808.0239.LDC2009T13	Earlier this week, China Eastern announced it plans to invest in business jet services to cater to China's rapidly expanding executive travel sector.

11665	APW_ENG_20080809.0666.LDC2009T13	Xu Yuan scored her second goal in as many games Saturday to help China rally to a 1-1 draw with Canada, putting the host in position to advance to the women's Olympic football quarterfinals.
11666	APW_ENG_20080809.0666.LDC2009T13	Yuan, who scored the opening goal in Wednesday's 2-1 victory over Sweden, found the net in the 36th minute to leave China and Canada with four points each atop Group E. China has only winless Argentina remaining, while Canada must face Sweden, a semifinalist four years ago in Athens.
11667	APW_ENG_20080809.0666.LDC2009T13	The top two teams from each of the three women's groups advance along with the two best third-place teams.
11668	APW_ENG_20080809.0666.LDC2009T13	"Normally with four points, we would hope to get out of the group," China coach Shang Ruihua said.
11669	APW_ENG_20080809.0666.LDC2009T13	"Argentina is developing fast, but we'll do our best."
11670	APW_ENG_20080809.0666.LDC2009T13	Kara Lang helped give Canada the lead in the 34th, intercepting an attempted clearance and chipping the ball into the path of a streaking Christine Sinclair.
11671	APW_ENG_20080809.0666.LDC2009T13	The Canadian veteran took one touch and hit a low right-footed shot past goalkeeper Zhang Yanru and into the net.
11672	APW_ENG_20080809.0666.LDC2009T13	"In the beginning of the first half, we played pretty good, and also in the last minutes," Shang said.

11674	APW_ENG_20080809.0666.LDC2009T13	China leveled two minutes later when Xu -- unmarked after receiving Lou Jaihui's through ball -- rounded Canada goalkeeper Erin McLeod and struck a low shot that defender Randee Hermus failed to clear off the line in a sliding attempt.
11675	APW_ENG_20080809.0666.LDC2009T13	For the second game in a row, China enjoyed the thunderous support from the home crowd -- announced at 52,600 in the 60,000-seat Tianjin Olympic Sports Center Stadium.
11676	APW_ENG_20080809.0666.LDC2009T13	Although short of official capacity, there didn't appear to be an empty seat.
11677	APW_ENG_20080809.0666.LDC2009T13	Both sides made one personnel change from their opening victories, both for apparent injuries.
11678	APW_ENG_20080809.0666.LDC2009T13	Hermus replaced Canada forward Melissa Tancredi, forcing a number of tactical changes, while 17-year-old Lou came in for Han Duan.
11679	APW_ENG_20080809.0666.LDC2009T13	Lou replaced Han in the 83rd minute of China's 2-1 victory over Sweden on Wednesday, 11 minutes after Han had scored the winning goal.
11680	APW_ENG_20080809.0666.LDC2009T13	Canada coach Even Pellerud moved Sinclair from her forward spot to a withdrawn position on the left.
11681	APW_ENG_20080809.0666.LDC2009T13	With Lang alone up front, Sinclair found more space than on Wednesday, when the Canadians beat Argentina 2-1.
11682	APW_ENG_20080809.0666.LDC2009T13	"I did not expect us to be as dominant as we were," Pellerud said, adding that his changes were made to use the "fresh legs" of the replacements.
11683	APW_ENG_20080809.0666.LDC2009T13	"Christine is smooth and smart about her positioning.
11684	APW_ENG_20080809.0666.LDC2009T13	She's able to play in many positions."
11685	APW_ENG_20080809.0666.LDC2009T13	Both sides hit the post in the second half Saturday.
11686	APW_ENG_20080809.0666.LDC2009T13	Lang struck a right-footed shot that smacked the right post in the 58th, while Xu's header clipped the bar in the 79th from Bi Yan's free kick.

11691	APW_ENG_20080813.0219.LDC2009T13	Bartoli lost the first set 7-6 (5) and was trailing 2-2 in the second set when she called for a trainer, who was seen working on her abdomen as Bartoli lay on her back.

11698	APW_ENG_20080813.0219.LDC2009T13	"She served well and took her chances," Mauresmo said.

11717	APW_ENG_20080813.1721.LDC2009T13	It's the kind of claim that could provoke a dangerous Kremlin riposte: The Pentagon is readying to take over airports and ports in the former Soviet republic of Georgia.
11718	APW_ENG_20080813.1721.LDC2009T13	The claim, by Georgia's U.S.-backed president, Mikhail Saakashvili, on Wednesday was swiftly denied by officials in Washington, who firmly denied any such designs on Georgian soil.
11719	APW_ENG_20080813.1721.LDC2009T13	It was the latest in a string of overstated pronouncements by the charismatic, American-educated Georgian leader that are further fueling tensions with Moscow.
11720	APW_ENG_20080813.1721.LDC2009T13	His comments -- along with a stream of biased, conflicting and often false information coming from both Russian and Georgian officials -- have made it hard to figure out what is really happening in the world's latest hotspot.
11721	APW_ENG_20080813.1721.LDC2009T13	Fighting between the Russian and Georgian armies raged for days, leaving hundreds dead and some 100,000 forced from their homes.
11722	APW_ENG_20080813.1721.LDC2009T13	The U.S. government and world diplomats are scrambling for a way to cool the tensions, which erupted in warfare when Georgia sought to retake control over the breakaway province of South Ossetia last Thursday and Russia responded with overwhelming military force.
11723	APW_ENG_20080813.1721.LDC2009T13	Saakashvili has been conducting daily interviews in his fluent English on international television networks and making frequent televised speeches at home.
11724	APW_ENG_20080813.1721.LDC2009T13	On Wednesday, he said in an interview on CNN that Russian troops were "closing on the capital, circling," and planning to install their own government in Tbilisi.
11725	APW_ENG_20080813.1721.LDC2009T13	Associated Press reporters in the area saw no sign of an impending coup.
11726	APW_ENG_20080813.1721.LDC2009T13	An AP reporter saw dozens of Russian trucks and armored vehicles heading south from the central city of Gori in the direction of Tbilisi, but they later turned away.
11727	APW_ENG_20080813.1721.LDC2009T13	Saakashvili said Russian troops moving deeper into Georgia "even steal toilet seats."
11728	APW_ENG_20080813.1721.LDC2009T13	Saakashvili later said on Georgian national television that the U.S. arrival of a military cargo plane with humanitarian aid "means that Georgia's ports and airports will be taken under the control of the U.S. Defense Department."
11729	APW_ENG_20080813.1721.LDC2009T13	Pentagon spokesman Geoff Morrell responded, "We have no need, nor do we intend to take over any Georgian air or seaport to deliver humanitarian aid.
11730	APW_ENG_20080813.1721.LDC2009T13	... We have no designs on taking control of any Georgian facility."
11731	APW_ENG_20080813.1721.LDC2009T13	Saakashvili has repeatedly compared the Russian incursions to Hitler's invasion of Poland in 1939, to the Soviet crackdown in Prague in 1968 and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979.
11732	APW_ENG_20080813.1721.LDC2009T13	In his Wednesday TV address, he said, "Russia has lost more airplanes than in any conflict of this scale since 1939."
11733	APW_ENG_20080813.1721.LDC2009T13	The calculation seemed unlikely given how brief the fighting has been and given how uneven the two countries' forces are.
11734	APW_ENG_20080813.1721.LDC2009T13	He also cited rumors that Russia was planning to bomb a rally in Tbilisi on Tuesday.
11735	APW_ENG_20080813.1721.LDC2009T13	The rally ended peacefully.
11736	APW_ENG_20080813.1721.LDC2009T13	Saakashvili insists he's not overstating anything, and lamented Wednesday that the West ignored his warnings that Russia was planning a military operation in Georgia as "exaggerations."

11739	APW_ENG_20080813.1721.LDC2009T13	Saakashvili, who graduated from Columbia University Law School, has always been blunt, and his bold language and flamboyant manner helped drive the Rose Revolution that brought him to power after disputed elections in 2003.
11740	APW_ENG_20080813.1721.LDC2009T13	He has long been derided in Russia, where he is seen as a vassal of the United States as it seeks to expand its influence in Moscow's backyard.

11750	APW_ENG_20080817.0349.LDC2009T13	Kaori Icho of Japan has repeated as the Olympic women's 63-kilogram wrestling gold medalist, defeating Alena Kartashova of Russia on Sunday by winning each of the two periods in overtime.
11751	APW_ENG_20080817.0349.LDC2009T13	Icho, who has won every world championship in her weight class since 2002, is the younger sister of two-time 48 kg silver medalist Chiharu Icho.
11752	APW_ENG_20080817.0349.LDC2009T13	The bronzes were won by Randi Miller of the United States, and Yelena Shalygina of Kazakhstan.
11753	APW_ENG_20080817.0349.LDC2009T13	The second overtime took only four seconds as, after a scoreless period, Icho went into the lockup position and grabbed Kartashova around the left knee to dump her to the mat for the decisive two- point takedown.
11754	APW_ENG_20080817.0349.LDC2009T13	Hardly a stunner.
11755	APW_ENG_20080817.0349.LDC2009T13	Icho and teammate Saori Yoshida are the world's dominant women's wrestlers, with two Olympic golds apiece, Yoshida at 55 kg, in as many games since the sport gained Olympic recognition.
11756	APW_ENG_20080817.0349.LDC2009T13	There was a surprise -- Miller, wrestling in her first world- level senior international tournament for the United States, and Yelena Shalygina of Kazakhstan won the bronzes.
11757	APW_ENG_20080817.0349.LDC2009T13	Icho said she wouldn't have won either gold without her sister.
11758	APW_ENG_20080817.0349.LDC2009T13	No doubt she was trying to ease the disappointment big sister felt by again not being able to match her sister's gold.
11759	APW_ENG_20080817.0349.LDC2009T13	"I've been training hard with her the last four years," Icho said.
11760	APW_ENG_20080817.0349.LDC2009T13	"I think I can do it because I've been training with her.
11761	APW_ENG_20080817.0349.LDC2009T13	I told Chiharu the gold medal is for her, too."
11762	APW_ENG_20080817.0349.LDC2009T13	If Icho is to go for a third gold, it may be up to her sister, too.
11763	APW_ENG_20080817.0349.LDC2009T13	Kaori Icho said if her 26-year-old sister wants to work toward London in 2012, she will, too.

11765	APW_ENG_20080817.0349.LDC2009T13	"I'm not sure if I want to compete by myself.
11766	APW_ENG_20080817.0349.LDC2009T13	If Chiharu will go, I should say I will go," she said.
11767	APW_ENG_20080817.0349.LDC2009T13	Miller beat out 2002 silver medalist Sara McMann to make the U.S. team and, while she didn't match her medal, she won only the second medal in 10 weight classes by a U.S. wrestler in Beijing.
11768	APW_ENG_20080817.0349.LDC2009T13	Adam Wheeler, also a world-level senior tournament rookie, got a bronze at 96 kg in Greco-Roman.
11769	APW_ENG_20080817.0349.LDC2009T13	"This isn't what I came here for, but I'll take it and work hard to get back," said the 24-year-old Miller, a former Dallas-area high school wrestler whose career has taken off in the last year.

11782	APW_ENG_20080821.1263.LDC2009T13	CARACAS, Venezuela 2008-08-21 17:45:26 UTC
11783	APW_ENG_20080821.1263.LDC2009T13	An ancient tar pit exposed when Venezuelan oil workers laid a pipeline has yielded a rich trove of fossils, including a type of saber-toothed cat that paleontologists had never found before in South America.
11784	APW_ENG_20080821.1263.LDC2009T13	Scientists say the find holds the promise of many discoveries to come.
11785	APW_ENG_20080821.1263.LDC2009T13	The fossils are 1.8 million years old and include skulls and jawbones of six scimitar-toothed cats -- a variety of saber- toothed cat with shorter, narrower canine teeth than other species.
11786	APW_ENG_20080821.1263.LDC2009T13	Researchers led by Venezuelan paleontologist Ascanio Rincon announced the discovery this month, saying in addition to proving the cat once lived here, the find also should offer a rare window into the environment shortly after North and South America became connected following an age of separation.
11787	APW_ENG_20080821.1263.LDC2009T13	"The deposit could be one of the most important in South America in the last 60 years," Rincon told The Associated Press.
11788	APW_ENG_20080821.1263.LDC2009T13	Other experts agree.
11789	APW_ENG_20080821.1263.LDC2009T13	"The find is one of the most spectacular and scientifically interesting discoveries of the last decade," said University of Kansas professor Larry D. Martin, an expert on saber-toothed cats who was not involved in the find.
11790	APW_ENG_20080821.1263.LDC2009T13	"The genus hadn't been known from South America before."
11791	APW_ENG_20080821.1263.LDC2009T13	The tar pits are larger than two football fields and near the surface of the soil in the eastern state of Monagas, an oil-rich area.
11792	APW_ENG_20080821.1263.LDC2009T13	The state oil company set aside the site for research in 2006 and contacted Rincon at the Venezuelan Institute for Scientific Studies.
11793	APW_ENG_20080821.1263.LDC2009T13	After months of digging, he and his team found the prized fossils in April 2007.
11794	APW_ENG_20080821.1263.LDC2009T13	But for the past year, Venezuela's Cultural Heritage Institute has inexplicably barred researchers from the site, which Rincon says has left it exposed to sun and rain, and potentially damaged the fossils.
11795	APW_ENG_20080821.1263.LDC2009T13	The Cultural Heritage Institute revoked Rincon's permit last year, and has yet to publicly explain why.
11796	APW_ENG_20080821.1263.LDC2009T13	Rincon said his institution is negotiating with the agency so that researchers may return.
11797	APW_ENG_20080821.1263.LDC2009T13	Rincon first spoke of the discovery at a symposium on scimitar- toothed cats in Pocatello, Idaho, in May.
11798	APW_ENG_20080821.1263.LDC2009T13	Rincon and other researchers say the find suggests scimitar- toothed cats -- of the genus Homotherium -- crossed from North America to South America shortly after the continents grew together and became linked in modern-day Panama following a 65 -million-year separation, a "moment of great exchange" between the continents.
11799	APW_ENG_20080821.1263.LDC2009T13	Another expert, Argentine paleontologist Francisco Prevosti, called the Venezuelan discovery of "utmost importance for South American paleontology."
11800	APW_ENG_20080821.1263.LDC2009T13	Prevosti and other experts say the now-extinct scimitar-toothed cat was previously confirmed to have inhabited Africa, Europe, Asia and North America -- but not South America.

11811	APW_ENG_20080826.1086.LDC2009T13	The U.S. military stood by its account, that 25 militants and five civilians were killed in the operation.
11812	APW_ENG_20080826.1086.LDC2009T13	"I don't have any information that would suggest that our military commanders in Afghanistan don't believe, still, that this was a legitimate strike on a Taliban target," Defense Department spokesman Bryan Whitman said in Washington.
11813	APW_ENG_20080826.1086.LDC2009T13	The U.N. allegation comes a day after President Hamid Karzai's government said it will try to put more controls on the way American and NATO troops operate in response to a series of airstrikes and other operations this summer that have caused the deaths of scores of civilians.
11814	APW_ENG_20080826.1086.LDC2009T13	Afghanistan's Council of Ministers ordered the ministries of defense and foreign affairs to open negotiations with the U.S. and NATO over the use of airstrikes, house searches and the detentions of Afghan civilians.
11815	APW_ENG_20080826.1086.LDC2009T13	It also called for a "status of force" agreement to regulate the troops' presence.
11816	APW_ENG_20080826.1086.LDC2009T13	Afghanistan's effort to rein in foreign forces is similar to steps taken by the Iraqi government, which has demanded a timetable for the withdrawal of U.S. troops and greater control of U.S. operations until their departure.
11817	APW_ENG_20080826.1086.LDC2009T13	The U.N.'s allegation of such a large number of civilian deaths could set the U.S., U.N. and the Afghan government on a collision course over the use of military force in Afghan villages, where international troops battle Taliban and al-Qaida militants daily.
11818	APW_ENG_20080826.1086.LDC2009T13	Vitaly Churkin, the Russian ambassador to the United Nations, said the Russians were raising the issue of the civilian casualties in Afghanistan with the U.N. Security Council.
11819	APW_ENG_20080826.1086.LDC2009T13	Afghan officials also say that scores of civilians -- between 76 and 90 -- were killed in Herat province on Friday.
11820	APW_ENG_20080826.1086.LDC2009T13	Civilian casualties have long been a major source of friction between President Hamid Karzai and his Western backers.
11821	APW_ENG_20080826.1086.LDC2009T13	Afghan officials say civilian deaths create a rift between the government and the people that Taliban and other anti-government forces use as leverage to turn villagers away from the government.
11822	APW_ENG_20080826.1086.LDC2009T13	According to an Associated Press tally, 705 civilians have been killed this year: 536 by militants, and 158 by international forces
11823	APW_ENG_20080826.1086.LDC2009T13	11 civilians have died in cross fire.
11824	APW_ENG_20080826.1086.LDC2009T13	The numbers do not include figures from the Herat battle and likely do not account for all civilian deaths this year.
11825	APW_ENG_20080826.1086.LDC2009T13	U.S. and NATO officials say they take great care in their targeting but also accuse the militants of hiding in civilian homes and using Afghans as human shields.
11826	APW_ENG_20080826.1086.LDC2009T13	Another factor, diplomats in Kabul say, is that Karzai is running for re-election next year.
11827	APW_ENG_20080826.1086.LDC2009T13	Blaming foreigners for the ills afflicting the country is a sure way to win popular support.
11828	APW_ENG_20080826.1086.LDC2009T13	Anti-foreigner sentiment has been rising over the years here, partly because of civilian deaths but also because many Afghans do not see the benefits of billions of dollars in aid that have poured into the country since the ouster of the Taliban in late 2001.
11829	APW_ENG_20080826.1086.LDC2009T13	Karzai's spokesman, Humayun Hamidzada, said Tuesday that the ministers' decision was made after Afghan officials "lost patience" with foreign forces, and the killings and detentions of civilians during raids in remote villages.
11830	APW_ENG_20080826.1086.LDC2009T13	"We do not want international forces to leave Afghanistan until the time our security institutions are able to defend Afghanistan independently," Hamidzada told reporters.
11831	APW_ENG_20080826.1086.LDC2009T13	But the presence of those forces has to be based "within the framework of Afghan law with respect to international law," he said.
11832	APW_ENG_20080826.1086.LDC2009T13	Hamidzada said circumstances have changed.
11833	APW_ENG_20080826.1086.LDC2009T13	"Afghanistan of 2001 is different from Afghanistan today," he said.
11834	APW_ENG_20080826.1086.LDC2009T13	He said the government has not discussed any timetable for the withdrawal of international forces from Afghanistan.
11835	APW_ENG_20080826.1086.LDC2009T13	Air Force Lt. Col. Patrick Ryder, a Pentagon spokesman, said the legal framework for the presence of U.S. troops in Afghanistan was established in a 2003 agreement between Kabul and Washington.
11836	APW_ENG_20080826.1086.LDC2009T13	Done via an exchange of diplomatic notes, the pact is considered a bilateral agreement and is like a status of forces agreement, Ryder said.
11837	APW_ENG_20080826.1086.LDC2009T13	In a statement Tuesday, the U.N. put its weight behind the Afghan government claim of civilian deaths in Herat, saying its investigators "found convincing evidence, based on the testimony of eyewitnesses, and others, that some 90 civilians were killed, including 60 children, 15 women and 15 men."
11838	APW_ENG_20080826.1086.LDC2009T13	The U.N. did not provide photos or evidence that its investigators who went to the scene saw any graves or that any militants were among those killed.
11839	APW_ENG_20080826.1086.LDC2009T13	Instead it relied on statements of villagers, local officials and eyewitnesses.
11840	APW_ENG_20080826.1086.LDC2009T13	Dan McNorton, a spokesman for the U.N. in Kabul, said the world body's investigation is ongoing.
11841	APW_ENG_20080826.1086.LDC2009T13	The U.N. said that "residents were able to confirm the number of casualties, including names, age and gender of the victims."
11842	APW_ENG_20080826.1086.LDC2009T13	"The destruction from aerial bombardment was clearly evident with some 7-8 houses having been totally destroyed and serious damage to many others," the statement said.
11843	APW_ENG_20080826.1086.LDC2009T13	The top U.S. coalition commander has ordered an investigation.
11844	APW_ENG_20080826.1086.LDC2009T13	"We welcome getting all the facts on the table," said Corina Sanders, a U.S. Embassy spokeswoman.
11845	APW_ENG_20080826.1086.LDC2009T13	"We take civilian casualties very seriously."

11849	APW_ENG_20080827.0666.LDC2009T13	LONDON 2008-08-27 14:25:54 UTC
11850	APW_ENG_20080827.0666.LDC2009T13	Tottenham may be about to bolster its depleted attack by signing Roman Pavlyuchenko from Spartak Moscow after the Russia striker said he is set to join the Premier League club.
11851	APW_ENG_20080827.0666.LDC2009T13	The reluctant sale of Robbie Keane to Liverpool and a lengthy impasse over Dimitar Berbatov's likely transfer to Manchester United left Tottenham with only Darren Bent up front for its opening two Premier League matches.
11852	APW_ENG_20080827.0666.LDC2009T13	A pair of defeats and Bent's difficulty in adapting to the lone forward role have increased Tottenham's need to sign a new striker.
11853	APW_ENG_20080827.0666.LDC2009T13	The 26-year-old Pavlyuchenko has been linked with Spurs since scoring three goals in Russia's surprise run to the European Championship semifinals in June and could now be about to move after withdrawing from Spartak Moscow's Champions League qualifier against Dynamo Kiev, which was scheduled for Wednesday.
11854	APW_ENG_20080827.0666.LDC2009T13	According to Wednesday's edition of Moscow-based sports daily Sovetsky Sport, Pavlyuchenko returned to Moscow from Kiev on Tuesday for talks with Tottenham officials.
11855	APW_ENG_20080827.0666.LDC2009T13	"Tottenham has already made a formal proposal," Spartak chairman Valery Karpin was quoted as saying by Sovetsky Sport.
11856	APW_ENG_20080827.0666.LDC2009T13	"They have made us a firm offer and we are happy with it.
11857	APW_ENG_20080827.0666.LDC2009T13	"As long as Roman agrees to sign a deal with the club, we are prepared to let him go.
11858	APW_ENG_20080827.0666.LDC2009T13	Footballers don't get chances like this all the time, maybe only once in a lifetime.
11859	APW_ENG_20080827.0666.LDC2009T13	If Roman goes to England, it will good for Tottenham and for himself."
11860	APW_ENG_20080827.0666.LDC2009T13	Karpin did not say what the transfer fee would be, indicating only that it is less than the Russian record euro30 million (US$44 million) Zenit St. Petersburg paid for Portugal midfielder Danny this week.
11861	APW_ENG_20080827.0666.LDC2009T13	British papers have suggested he will cost about 12 million pounds (US$12 million
11862	APW_ENG_20080827.0666.LDC2009T13	euro8 million), far less than Zenit St. Petersburg was asking Tottenham to pay for Pavlyuchenko's Russia teammate Andrei Arshavin.
11863	APW_ENG_20080827.0666.LDC2009T13	That move now appears to be unlikely.
11864	APW_ENG_20080827.0666.LDC2009T13	Sovetsky Sport quoted the player as saying money was not the motivating factor in his desire to leave.
11865	APW_ENG_20080827.0666.LDC2009T13	"That is not the reason for the move," Pavlyuchenko told the paper.
11866	APW_ENG_20080827.0666.LDC2009T13	"The only thing that has kept me from moving is my family.
11867	APW_ENG_20080827.0666.LDC2009T13	It was difficult for me to imagine how my wife and daughter could move from a place they are used to.
11868	APW_ENG_20080827.0666.LDC2009T13	I was also embarrassed that I could not speak English.

11870	APW_ENG_20080827.0666.LDC2009T13	I have decided I will sign with Tottenham.

11872	APW_ENG_20080827.0666.LDC2009T13	I will fly to England to sign the contract."
11873	APW_ENG_20080827.0666.LDC2009T13	With the close of the transfer window just five days away, Tottenham was involved in another move on Wednesday -- selling South Korea fullback Lee Young-pyo to German side Borussia Dortmund.

11898	APW_ENG_20080910.1471.LDC2009T13	Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. has agreed to pay a $575,000 fine in a settlement over alleged violations of short-selling rules in 2005 and 2006, New York Stock Exchange regulators said Wednesday.
11899	APW_ENG_20080910.1471.LDC2009T13	It was the largest fine ever levied by NYSE Regulation for alleged trading violations on NYSE Arca, the sibling electronic exchange.
11900	APW_ENG_20080910.1471.LDC2009T13	Deutsche Bank also was censured in the disciplinary action.
11901	APW_ENG_20080910.1471.LDC2009T13	The investment firm neither admitted nor denied wrongdoing.
11902	APW_ENG_20080910.1471.LDC2009T13	The regulators said that between January 2005 and October 2006, Deutsche Bank executed a number of short sales on ineligible stocks without having borrowed the shares, made arrangements for borrowing them, or having "reasonable grounds" to believe they could be borrowed when necessary.
11903	APW_ENG_20080910.1471.LDC2009T13	The stocks in question weren't on the firm's list of securities that are allowed to be sold short in that fashion, the regulators said.
11904	APW_ENG_20080910.1471.LDC2009T13	That was in violation of securities regulations related to short- selling, they said.
11905	APW_ENG_20080910.1471.LDC2009T13	Deutsche Bank also failed to adequately supervise some traders who engaged in the short sales, according to the regulators.
11906	APW_ENG_20080910.1471.LDC2009T13	Short sellers bet that a stock's price will fall so that they can profit from it.
11907	APW_ENG_20080910.1471.LDC2009T13	They borrow shares of the stock and sell them.
11908	APW_ENG_20080910.1471.LDC2009T13	If the price drops, they buy cheaper actual shares to cover the borrowed ones, pocketing the difference.
11909	APW_ENG_20080910.1471.LDC2009T13	So-called "naked" short selling occurs when sellers don't even borrow the shares before selling them, and then look to cover positions immediately after the sale.
11910	APW_ENG_20080910.1471.LDC2009T13	"We're pleased to resolve this matter," Deutsche Bank spokesman Ted Meyer said.
11911	APW_ENG_20080910.1471.LDC2009T13	Deutsche Bank AG, the German bank that is the investment firm's parent, rose 89 cents, or 1 percent, to end at $85.61 in trading Wednesday.

11916	APW_ENG_20080912.1080.LDC2009T13	VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- Australia and the Philippines signed agreements Friday enabling them to receive real-time data on any earthquake that could cause a tsunami, information that would come from an organization overseeing a treaty banning nuclear explosions.
11917	APW_ENG_20080912.1080.LDC2009T13	The Vienna-based Preparatory Commission for the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty Organization said data it collects at its monitoring facilities, which are set up to detect nuclear explosions, could be transmitted within 30 seconds and give authorities two and a half minutes of additional warning.
11918	APW_ENG_20080912.1080.LDC2009T13	That vital time could be used to alert the public ahead of the devastating waves.

11921	APW_ENG_20080912.1080.LDC2009T13	The Vienna-based organization's executive secretary, Tibor Toth, signed separate agreements with Philippine Foreign Secretary Alberto Romulo and Peter Shannon, Australia's permanent representative to the United Nations in Vienna.

11923	APW_ENG_20080912.1080.LDC2009T13	Shannon said the deal was "part of a network that has developed since the terrible disasters that the Asia-Pacific region experienced."

11944	APW_ENG_20080914.0024.LDC2009T13	Pakistan's government has eased its rhetoric against an upsurge in unilateral U.S. strikes on militant havens near the Afghan border, saying it hopes quiet diplomacy will persuade Washington the attacks are only inflaming sentiment against both countries' leadership.
11945	APW_ENG_20080914.0024.LDC2009T13	Defense Minister Ahmad Mukhtar claimed Washington has already agreed to curtail its activities in Pakistan, although a missile strike Friday killed at least 12 people.
11946	APW_ENG_20080914.0024.LDC2009T13	The White House declined comment, as it largely has done since reports emerged Thursday that U.S. President George W. Bush secretly approved more aggressive cross-border operations in July as part of a strategy to fight the resurgent Taliban in Afghanistan.
11947	APW_ENG_20080914.0024.LDC2009T13	"We have taken it up at the highest level with the State Department and Pentagon," Mukhtar said Saturday in what appeared to be a reference to the use of helicopter-borne U.S. ground forces in a Sept. 3 attack that killed at least 15.
11948	APW_ENG_20080914.0024.LDC2009T13	Most cross- border activity has been limited to missiles fired by unmanned drones, so the use of commandos represented an escalation.
11949	APW_ENG_20080914.0024.LDC2009T13	"They have given us assurance that it would not be repeated.
11950	APW_ENG_20080914.0024.LDC2009T13	The agreement we have with them is that we will exchange information and the Pakistan military or para-forces will take action against terrorists in Pakistan," Mukhtar said.
11951	APW_ENG_20080914.0024.LDC2009T13	Comments Saturday and Friday night by two top officials seemed to indicate that the government was trying to avoid an outright confrontation with Washington, its ally and financial supporter, after the main opposition party suggested Pakistan should consider dropping out of the war on terror if the cross-border attacks continue.
11952	APW_ENG_20080914.0024.LDC2009T13	Since Aug. 13, there have been at least seven reported missile strikes, as well as the ground forces operation, in tribally governed territory where the government has little control.

11954	APW_ENG_20080914.0024.LDC2009T13	A group of tribal elders representing about a half-million people in the North Waziristan area, where most of the missile attacks have occurred, threatened Saturday to join forces with Taliban militants in Afghanistan.
11955	APW_ENG_20080914.0024.LDC2009T13	"If America doesn't stop attacks in tribal areas, we will prepare a lashkar (army) to attack U.S. forces in Afghanistan," tribal chief Malik Nasrullah told a news conference in Miran Shah, the area's largest city.
11956	APW_ENG_20080914.0024.LDC2009T13	"We will also seek support from the tribal elders in Afghanistan to fight jointly against America."
11957	APW_ENG_20080914.0024.LDC2009T13	Protests against the U.S. incursions, each drawing about 50 people, were held Saturday in Karachi, Lahore and Quetta by the Pakistan Tehrik-e-Insaf party of cricket star-turned-politician Imran Khan.
11958	APW_ENG_20080914.0024.LDC2009T13	Some carried placards reading, "Bush worst example of human rights violations."
11959	APW_ENG_20080914.0024.LDC2009T13	Pakistan's government and military have issued stiff protests to Washington, although the criticism appeared to be mostly aimed at soothing domestic anger since Pakistan really has few options to influence U.S. policy short of opening fire on allied forces or cutting off relations.
11960	APW_ENG_20080914.0024.LDC2009T13	Mukhtar repeated Pakistan's contention that it is doing all it can to fight militancy and is suffering as a result, with more than 1,000 security forces killed since the country allied itself with Washington in its war on terror after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks in the United States.

11964	APW_ENG_20080916.1357.LDC2009T13	NEW YORK 2008-09-16 21:13:48 UTC
11965	APW_ENG_20080916.1357.LDC2009T13	Goldman Sachs Group Inc., the larger of the two remaining major independent U.S. investment banks, on Tuesday reported its worst slump in profits since going public in 1999.
11966	APW_ENG_20080916.1357.LDC2009T13	The world's largest investment bank reported third-quarter profit plunged 71 percent from the year-ago period, an almost unthinkable drop for a firm widely described as the smartest on Wall Street.
11967	APW_ENG_20080916.1357.LDC2009T13	Goldman's results reflect continuing damage from the ongoing credit crisis that has already vanquished three of its rivals.
11968	APW_ENG_20080916.1357.LDC2009T13	Goldman and Morgan Stanley remain the only major independent investment banks on Wall Street after a major shake-up of the investment banking industry.
11969	APW_ENG_20080916.1357.LDC2009T13	Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. filed for bankruptcy Monday after succumbing to distressed real estate holdings, while Bear Stearns Cos. and Merrill Lynch &amp
11970	APW_ENG_20080916.1357.LDC2009T13	Co. were swallowed by commercial banks in emergency sales.
11971	APW_ENG_20080916.1357.LDC2009T13	After two years of record profits, Chairman and Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein has been the only CEO to navigate his firm through the market dislocation without posting a loss or major write-downs.
11972	APW_ENG_20080916.1357.LDC2009T13	He said "this was a challenging quarter" marred by a "decrease in client activity and declining asset valuations."
11973	APW_ENG_20080916.1357.LDC2009T13	That was reflected in the numbers.
11974	APW_ENG_20080916.1357.LDC2009T13	The New York-based investment bank posted a profit of $810 million, or $1.81 per share, after paying preferred dividends compared to $2.81 billion, or $6.13 per share, a year earlier.
11975	APW_ENG_20080916.1357.LDC2009T13	Revenue for the three months ended Aug. 29 skidded 51 percent to $6.04 billion from $12.3 billion a year ago.
11976	APW_ENG_20080916.1357.LDC2009T13	The results still beat Wall Street projections for $1.71 per share, according to analysts polled by Thomson Reuters.
11977	APW_ENG_20080916.1357.LDC2009T13	Revenue fell short of the $6.23 billion expected by analysts.
11978	APW_ENG_20080916.1357.LDC2009T13	The financial market turmoil is certainly one of the low points in Goldman's 139-year history.
11979	APW_ENG_20080916.1357.LDC2009T13	Though it has avoided the kind of bruising results turned in by many of its rivals, Goldman's shares are still down almost 50 percent from its 52-week high of $250.70.
11980	APW_ENG_20080916.1357.LDC2009T13	On Tuesday, the stock slid $2.49, or 1.8 percent, to $133.01 after sinking to a new 52-week low of $116.13 earlier in the session.
11981	APW_ENG_20080916.1357.LDC2009T13	Goldman's performance from some of its renowned businesses reflected the market's dislocation since the credit crisis began one year ago.
11982	APW_ENG_20080916.1357.LDC2009T13	Investment banking revenue tumbled 40 percent, and trading and investments notched 67 percent lower.

11986	APW_ENG_20080916.1357.LDC2009T13	That helped lift Goldman's asset management and securities services unit's revenue higher by 4 percent from the year-ago period.

11988	APW_ENG_20080916.1357.LDC2009T13	Co. agreeing to be acquired by Bank of America Corp., more pressure has come on Goldman to make a similar deal.
11989	APW_ENG_20080916.1357.LDC2009T13	Many analysts believe stand-alone investment banks can balance volatile businesses like investment banking or trading with the relative stability of deposits held by retail banks.
11990	APW_ENG_20080916.1357.LDC2009T13	Chief Financial Officer David Viniar rejected that Goldman needs to combine with another bank to survive.
11991	APW_ENG_20080916.1357.LDC2009T13	He said there remains opportunity in the market, especially buying up distressed debt that has driven its rivals out of business.
11992	APW_ENG_20080916.1357.LDC2009T13	He said the company is reducing risky positions, and expects Goldman's profit growth will rise or fall in tandem with the global economy.
11993	APW_ENG_20080916.1357.LDC2009T13	Further, it will also benefit from a financial landscape missing some longtime competitors.
11994	APW_ENG_20080916.1357.LDC2009T13	"We're not happy about what happened," Viniar said during a conference call with reporters.
11995	APW_ENG_20080916.1357.LDC2009T13	"We feel for the people in these institutions.
11996	APW_ENG_20080916.1357.LDC2009T13	They were very good firms that made the same mistakes we did.
11997	APW_ENG_20080916.1357.LDC2009T13	They made bigger ones and got caught up in a terrible market."
11998	APW_ENG_20080916.1357.LDC2009T13	However, he added that "while we have a lot of compassion, when there's less competition it is better for us.
11999	APW_ENG_20080916.1357.LDC2009T13	That sends more business our way, gives us pricing power, and we're seeing a little of that now."

12059	APW_ENG_20080924.0766.LDC2009T13	Financial markets turned lower again Wednesday, with stocks mostly declining after a short-lived pop on investor Warren Buffett's decision to invest $5 billion in Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
12060	APW_ENG_20080924.0766.LDC2009T13	The credit markets showed added strain as investors await news about the government's plan to rescue banks from crippling debt.
12061	APW_ENG_20080924.0766.LDC2009T13	Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc. said Tuesday it was investing at least $5 billion in Goldman -- a move Wall Street took as sign of support for the independent investment bank model.

12066	APW_ENG_20080924.0766.LDC2009T13	It could also lead to new questions from lawmakers for Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, a former co-CEO of Goldman Sachs.

12095	APW_ENG_20080925.0081.LDC2009T13	AP Interview: Mugabe urges West to lift sanctions
12096	APW_ENG_20080925.0081.LDC2009T13	UNITED NATIONS 2008-09-25 01:17:02 UTC
12097	APW_ENG_20080925.0081.LDC2009T13	Zimbabwe's president said Wednesday he sees no obstacles to carrying out a power-sharing agreement with rivals and hopes it will lead the West to ease sanctions, which he blamed for devastating the country's economy.
12098	APW_ENG_20080925.0081.LDC2009T13	In an interview with The Associated Press, the 84-year-old Robert Mugabe was sharp, quick and animated -- and made clear he is determined to remain president despite what he said were efforts by Britain and the United States to oust him.
12099	APW_ENG_20080925.0081.LDC2009T13	"They are waiting for a day when this man, this evil man, called Robert Mugabe is no longer in control," he said.
12100	APW_ENG_20080925.0081.LDC2009T13	"And I don't know when that day is coming."
12101	APW_ENG_20080925.0081.LDC2009T13	So he has no thoughts of resigning?
12102	APW_ENG_20080925.0081.LDC2009T13	"No -- or a thought of dying," Mugabe chuckled.
12103	APW_ENG_20080925.0081.LDC2009T13	Mugabe, who is to address the U.N. General Assembly on Thursday, dismissed Western reports that the Sept. 15 power-sharing deal could fall apart "because I don't know of any hitch."
12104	APW_ENG_20080925.0081.LDC2009T13	Under the agreement, Mugabe remains president but is supposed to cede some of the powers he has wielded for nearly three decades in the southern African country.
12105	APW_ENG_20080925.0081.LDC2009T13	Long-simmering and bitter differences as well as the nation's economic collapse, though, have put the deal under intense pressure.
12106	APW_ENG_20080925.0081.LDC2009T13	Mugabe said Wednesday the only outstanding issue is deciding on four of the 31 Cabinet posts, and the negotiations are continuing in Harare while he is in New York.
12107	APW_ENG_20080925.0081.LDC2009T13	He declined to say which posts are still being discussed.
12108	APW_ENG_20080925.0081.LDC2009T13	The agreement provides for 15 nominated by Mugabe's party, 13 by opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai and three by the leader of a smaller opposition faction, Arthur Mutambara.
12109	APW_ENG_20080925.0081.LDC2009T13	"Every one of us is actually positive about the agreement, or the need to cement the agreement and make it work," Mugabe said.
12110	APW_ENG_20080925.0081.LDC2009T13	"I don't see any reason why we can't work together as Zimbabweans," he said.
12111	APW_ENG_20080925.0081.LDC2009T13	"We are all sons of the soil, as we say, and the differences arise purely from own conceptions of what Zimbabwe should be and what the government of Zimbabwe should be."
12112	APW_ENG_20080925.0081.LDC2009T13	Tsvangirai won the most votes in March presidential polling, but not enough to avoid a runoff against Mugabe.
12113	APW_ENG_20080925.0081.LDC2009T13	An onslaught of violence against Tsvangirai's supporters led him to drop out of the presidential runoff and Mugabe was declared the overwhelming winner of the second vote, which was widely denounced as a sham.
12114	APW_ENG_20080925.0081.LDC2009T13	More than 100 opposition supporters were killed in the violence, thousands of people were beaten up and suffered broken limbs, and tens of thousands were forced from their homes.
12115	APW_ENG_20080925.0081.LDC2009T13	Mugabe, who has been in power since independence from Britain in 1980, and Tsvangirai have been enemies for a decade.
12116	APW_ENG_20080925.0081.LDC2009T13	Tsvangirai has been jailed, beaten, tortured and tried for treason -- charges that were dismissed in court.
12117	APW_ENG_20080925.0081.LDC2009T13	But Mugabe made clear Wednesday that he was willing to share power with Tsvangirai, who would become prime minister under the agreement, leading a council of ministers responsible for government policies and reporting to a Cabinet headed by Mugabe.
12118	APW_ENG_20080925.0081.LDC2009T13	Still, Mugabe did not spell out who would have the final say if there was a major disagreement.
12119	APW_ENG_20080925.0081.LDC2009T13	And while he repeated several times that all parties want the agreement to work, Mugabe dismissed Tsvangirai's Movement for Democratic Change as a creation of Britain's three major parties and beholden to its government.
12120	APW_ENG_20080925.0081.LDC2009T13	Mugabe described Zimbabwe's government as a pyramid with the president at the top, but he said "the president never settles on the matter alone," and always works with the vice presidents.
12121	APW_ENG_20080925.0081.LDC2009T13	"And now that we have a prime minister we rope him in and we discuss in the presidency, or whatever we call it, together, and we look at the issues and see what solutions can be applied to any problem that confronts us," Mugabe said.
12122	APW_ENG_20080925.0081.LDC2009T13	The power-sharing deal was mediated during months of negotiations by Thabo Mbeki, who has been forced to step down from the South African presidency by the country's ruling party.
12123	APW_ENG_20080925.0081.LDC2009T13	Mugabe said it was up to the Southern African Development Community to decide whether Mbeki continued as mediator.
12124	APW_ENG_20080925.0081.LDC2009T13	But the Zimbabwean president offered praise, saying Mbeki has been "quite excellent."
12125	APW_ENG_20080925.0081.LDC2009T13	"There is a man who has been in the seat for so many years as the father of the African National Congress and democracy in one stroke pulls him down," Mugabe said of Mbeki.
12126	APW_ENG_20080925.0081.LDC2009T13	"Democracy without morality is no democracy for all."
12127	APW_ENG_20080925.0081.LDC2009T13	Tsvangirai has repeatedly said he does not want a legal witch hunt in Zimbabwe, but that he believes some kind of truth and reconciliation process is necessary to allow healing after years of violence and repression.
12128	APW_ENG_20080925.0081.LDC2009T13	Mugabe disagreed.
12129	APW_ENG_20080925.0081.LDC2009T13	"At the moment, the fight between us has been one between Britain and ourselves -- Britain, of course, using as their front the opposition," Mugabe said.
12130	APW_ENG_20080925.0081.LDC2009T13	"So the British and the Americans, they've got to be reconciled to us."
12131	APW_ENG_20080925.0081.LDC2009T13	Western nations, who have shunned Mugabe's government and whose aid and investment are sorely needed, have reacted cautiously to the coalition agreement.
12132	APW_ENG_20080925.0081.LDC2009T13	Millions of dollars in aid are expected to flow in if Mugabe actually shares power.
12133	APW_ENG_20080925.0081.LDC2009T13	Mugabe said Wednesday the West should now begin removing "demonic" sanctions, which have targeted individuals and companies seen to be supporting his regime.
12134	APW_ENG_20080925.0081.LDC2009T13	They were tightened after elections this spring and the European Union recently added an arms ban.
12135	APW_ENG_20080925.0081.LDC2009T13	"We don't expect investment from countries that are hostile," Mugabe said.
12136	APW_ENG_20080925.0081.LDC2009T13	"They can keep their investment, but we would hope in the first place that sanctions would be lifted.
12137	APW_ENG_20080925.0081.LDC2009T13	There is no reason for imposing sanctions on Zimbabwe at all.
12138	APW_ENG_20080925.0081.LDC2009T13	There has never been any reason for it, you see, except hostility."
12139	APW_ENG_20080925.0081.LDC2009T13	European Union foreign ministers have welcomed the power-sharing deal but have said that Mugabe must prove he is willing to restore democratic rule before EU sanctions can be lifted.
12140	APW_ENG_20080925.0081.LDC2009T13	Zimbabwe has the world's highest inflation rate even by the official figure of at 11 million percent, and independent economists put it much higher.
12141	APW_ENG_20080925.0081.LDC2009T13	Critics have linked Zimbabwe's economic slide to Mugabe's 2000 order that commercial farms be seized from whites.
12142	APW_ENG_20080925.0081.LDC2009T13	Mugabe says the land reform program was meant to help poor blacks and blames the country's economic collapse on Western sanctions.
12143	APW_ENG_20080925.0081.LDC2009T13	Food, fuel, hospital supplies and other necessities are scarce as prices skyrocket in the region's former breadbasket.
12144	APW_ENG_20080925.0081.LDC2009T13	And millions of Zimbabweans, including doctors, teachers, business owners and others with important skills, have fled the country.
12145	APW_ENG_20080925.0081.LDC2009T13	Mugabe said Wednesday that Zimbabwe can return to its former economic status, saying "if only the West can leave us alone, you will certainly see us come up."
12146	APW_ENG_20080925.0081.LDC2009T13	"It will take us time because we have lost some time because of sanctions," he said.
12147	APW_ENG_20080925.0081.LDC2009T13	While critics have complained about Zimbabwe's human rights record, Mugabe said the African Union and southern African leaders have not.
12148	APW_ENG_20080925.0081.LDC2009T13	When asked whether he would allow Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International to come in, he replied: "Ha!
12149	APW_ENG_20080925.0081.LDC2009T13	Ha!
12150	APW_ENG_20080925.0081.LDC2009T13	Ha!

12155	APW_ENG_20080925.0081.LDC2009T13	Mugabe also dismissed calls from those who say he should be tried for human rights abuses.
12156	APW_ENG_20080925.0081.LDC2009T13	"I'm sure they forget I am not Mr. Bush who invaded Iraq ... Probably they mistake me for him.
12157	APW_ENG_20080925.0081.LDC2009T13	Isn't that the man who should be tried before I am tried?"

12173	APW_ENG_20081001.0688.LDC2009T13	"What happens in the United States will affect the entire world and, above all, small countries like ours."
12174	APW_ENG_20081001.0688.LDC2009T13	In Europe, where some blame a phenomenon of "casino capitalism" that has become deeply engrained from New York to London to Moscow, there is more of a sense of shared responsibility.
12175	APW_ENG_20081001.0688.LDC2009T13	But Europeans also blame the U.S. government for letting things get out of hand.
12176	APW_ENG_20081001.0688.LDC2009T13	"I have to do with this situation all the time," said Norbert Weigel, a merchant banker smoking a cigarette near Frankfurt's main station Wednesday morning.

12178	APW_ENG_20081001.0688.LDC2009T13	Investment bankers made investments on products where they didn't understand the risk and were trying to make fast profits."
12179	APW_ENG_20081001.0688.LDC2009T13	Mezat Oyena, a native of southwestern Turkey who owns a barbershop in Berlin's central Mitte neighborhood, blames the crisis for a dropoff in his business.

12183	APW_ENG_20081001.0688.LDC2009T13	Amid harsh criticism is a growing consensus that stricter financial regulation is needed to prevent unfettered capitalism from destroying economies around the globe.
12184	APW_ENG_20081001.0688.LDC2009T13	Especially, leaders of developing nations that kept spending tight and opened their economies in response to American demands are warning of other consequences -- a loss of U.S. influence globally and the likelihood that the world's poor will suffer the most from greed by the biggest players in global finance.
12185	APW_ENG_20081001.0688.LDC2009T13	"They spent the last three decades saying we needed to do our chores.
12186	APW_ENG_20081001.0688.LDC2009T13	They didn't," a grim-faced Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva said Tuesday.

12189	APW_ENG_20081001.0688.LDC2009T13	It's harder for European leaders to point the finger directly at the United States since many of their financiers participated in the recklessness.

12195	APW_ENG_20081001.0688.LDC2009T13	The crisis also has strengthened voices in France and Germany calling for EU regulations to eliminate highly deregulated financial markets, despite objections from Britain, which along with the U.S. is considered by some to practice a freer form of "Anglo-Saxon" capitalism.

12199	APW_ENG_20081001.0688.LDC2009T13	In some developing nations, state enterprises were privatized, currencies were allowed to float against the U.S. dollar and painful measures were taken to bring down debts.

12223	APW_ENG_20081002.0087.LDC2009T13	US regulator extends short-sell ban for financials
12224	APW_ENG_20081002.0087.LDC2009T13	WASHINGTON 2008-10-02 01:47:13 UTC
12225	APW_ENG_20081002.0087.LDC2009T13	Federal regulators on Wednesday extended an unprecedented ban against all short-selling in the shares of more than 800 financial companies, keeping it in place at least until after Congress enacts a massive financial bailout plan.
12226	APW_ENG_20081002.0087.LDC2009T13	The Securities and Exchange Commission announced the extension of the ban, which was put in on Sept. 18 in a bid to shore up investor confidence in the face of the spiraling market crisis.
12227	APW_ENG_20081002.0087.LDC2009T13	The ban, which was to expire Thursday, now will last until the third business day after enactment of the $700 billion financial bailout plan now before Congress.
12228	APW_ENG_20081002.0087.LDC2009T13	It will end no later than Oct. 17.
12229	APW_ENG_20081002.0087.LDC2009T13	Late Wednesday, the Senate passed the bailout plan, which appeared to be gaining ground in the House of Representatives, where Republican opposition softened.
12230	APW_ENG_20081002.0087.LDC2009T13	The idea is that the extension will give enough time for financial markets to calm, with the bailout program's plan to buy up Wall Street's toxic mortgage debt possibly starting to have a positive effect.
12231	APW_ENG_20081002.0087.LDC2009T13	By law, the SEC's emergency ban could not be extended beyond Oct. 17.
12232	APW_ENG_20081002.0087.LDC2009T13	In the days since the ban took effect, the stock market has been on a rollercoaster ride.
12233	APW_ENG_20081002.0087.LDC2009T13	On Monday, the day the bailout plan was rejected in the House, the market shot downward and sent the Dow Jones industrials on a record 778-point plunge.
12234	APW_ENG_20081002.0087.LDC2009T13	Short-sellers bet against a stock.
12235	APW_ENG_20081002.0087.LDC2009T13	The practice, which is legal and widely used on Wall Street, involves borrowing a company's shares, selling them, and then buying them when the stock falls and returning them to the lender.
12236	APW_ENG_20081002.0087.LDC2009T13	The short-seller pockets the difference in price.
12237	APW_ENG_20081002.0087.LDC2009T13	Although short selling can make markets more efficient and bring in more capital, regulators have maintained that it has widened the scope of the financial crisis and contributed to the collapsing values of investment- and commercial-bank stocks in particular.
12238	APW_ENG_20081002.0087.LDC2009T13	The SEC "has taken steps during recent weeks to address concerns regarding short sales in light of the ongoing credit crisis," the agency said in a statement issued Wednesday night.
12239	APW_ENG_20081002.0087.LDC2009T13	"The steps (the SEC) has taken are designed to ensure the continued smooth operation of orderly markets.
12240	APW_ENG_20081002.0087.LDC2009T13	Our actions have been taken in consultation with regulators of the major developed securities markets around the world, with whom we have coordinated in monitoring market reactions."

12243	APW_ENG_20081004.0120.LDC2009T13	One of North America's renowned bird migration and bird watching areas is strangely silent.
12244	APW_ENG_20081004.0120.LDC2009T13	Blame Hurricane Ike.
12245	APW_ENG_20081004.0120.LDC2009T13	"We had red-winged blackbirds, sparrows, a bunch of migrating birds," recalled Ernest Stone, 75, leaning on his cane and surveying debris on the cratered moonscape that used to be the family beach house on Bolivar Peninsula.
12246	APW_ENG_20081004.0120.LDC2009T13	"I haven't seen a pigeon in a while," he said.
12247	APW_ENG_20081004.0120.LDC2009T13	"Seagulls.
12248	APW_ENG_20081004.0120.LDC2009T13	You could always go out and throw a piece of bread and the seagulls would come."
12249	APW_ENG_20081004.0120.LDC2009T13	Not now.
12250	APW_ENG_20081004.0120.LDC2009T13	"Nothing," his wife, Jimmie, said.
12251	APW_ENG_20081004.0120.LDC2009T13	"Zero."
12252	APW_ENG_20081004.0120.LDC2009T13	The same could be said for their home and beachfront community of Gilchrist, where little is standing three weeks after Ike roared ashore with 110 mph (177 kph) winds, a 12-foot (3.66-meter) storm surge and waves up to 26 feet (7.92 meters).
12253	APW_ENG_20081004.0120.LDC2009T13	The few palm trees or patches of grass, nearly unrecognizable amid the shells and dried mud, have turned a lifeless yellow brown, killed by sea water.
12254	APW_ENG_20081004.0120.LDC2009T13	For people surrounded by devastation with months of rebuilding ahead of them, the birds represent yet another piece of normalcy lost.
12255	APW_ENG_20081004.0120.LDC2009T13	"Pelicans and seagulls," Veronica Felty, 46, said, looking out over the gulf waters that wiped out her place.
12256	APW_ENG_20081004.0120.LDC2009T13	"Birds -- 40 to 50 in a row -- flying.
12257	APW_ENG_20081004.0120.LDC2009T13	They were endless.
12258	APW_ENG_20081004.0120.LDC2009T13	They were beautiful ... You wonder if they knew to leave."
12259	APW_ENG_20081004.0120.LDC2009T13	Bolivar Peninsula is part of what's known as the Great Texas Coastal Birding Trail, with nearby High Island a prime bird watching spot and traditional rest stop for migrating birds heading north in the spring and south in the fall.
12260	APW_ENG_20081004.0120.LDC2009T13	The Great Texas Birding Classic, a bird-watching tournament held every April during the spring migration, attracts participants from around the country and world as well.
12261	APW_ENG_20081004.0120.LDC2009T13	High Island, at 32 feet (9.75 meters) over sea level, is the highest spot on the gulf coastline for 700 miles (1,126 kilometers) between Mobile Bay, Alabama, and the Rio Grande, and attracts thousands of bird-watchers a year.
12262	APW_ENG_20081004.0120.LDC2009T13	"Now is when birds would normally be stopping at High Island to top off with bugs before heading south," said Ian Tizard, director of the Schubot Exotic Bird Health Center at Texas A&amp
12263	APW_ENG_20081004.0120.LDC2009T13	M University.
12264	APW_ENG_20081004.0120.LDC2009T13	"High Island has been stripped of leaves, and a lot of the trees are dying."
12265	APW_ENG_20081004.0120.LDC2009T13	While the loss is tough for bird watchers, Tizard said it might not be so bad for many of the birds: "From a migrating bird's point of view, it's probably not a big deal to fly a few miles on until they find a batch of trees that looks better."
12266	APW_ENG_20081004.0120.LDC2009T13	Tizard said he believes things will get better in the spring.
12267	APW_ENG_20081004.0120.LDC2009T13	Just like humans, the birds need three basics that Ike took away: cover, food and water.
12268	APW_ENG_20081004.0120.LDC2009T13	"There's no fresh water," said Texas Parks &amp
12269	APW_ENG_20081004.0120.LDC2009T13	Wildlife biologist Cliff Shackleford, who said a good rain would ease the island's woes.
12270	APW_ENG_20081004.0120.LDC2009T13	"That surge killed everything and dumped salt water into everything, probably for miles.
12271	APW_ENG_20081004.0120.LDC2009T13	"It doesn't mean they all died, but we don't really know.
12272	APW_ENG_20081004.0120.LDC2009T13	The birds ... need to drink, they need to bathe and salt water just doesn't do it."
12273	APW_ENG_20081004.0120.LDC2009T13	Any protection the birds would seek was wiped out when the trees and most structures were obliterated.
12274	APW_ENG_20081004.0120.LDC2009T13	"Look at the vegetation," Brent Ortega, one of Shackleford's colleagues, said.
12275	APW_ENG_20081004.0120.LDC2009T13	"Either there isn't any, or it's covered with salt.
12276	APW_ENG_20081004.0120.LDC2009T13	Plant material is dying, insects and seeds are not there any more.
12277	APW_ENG_20081004.0120.LDC2009T13	The habitat's changed and the birds have got to live.
12278	APW_ENG_20081004.0120.LDC2009T13	They probably moved somewhere else because it's not very suitable."
12279	APW_ENG_20081004.0120.LDC2009T13	Jimmie Stone, 67, looked at a pile of palm trees that used to border their driveway.
12280	APW_ENG_20081004.0120.LDC2009T13	"We had three on each side," she said.
12281	APW_ENG_20081004.0120.LDC2009T13	"We had a huge tree in the yard.
12282	APW_ENG_20081004.0120.LDC2009T13	We had a bird feeder..."
12283	APW_ENG_20081004.0120.LDC2009T13	Instead, chunks of broken concrete -- their former driveway, the home foundation, the patio -- tip at angles where waves lifted them and cast them aside.
12284	APW_ENG_20081004.0120.LDC2009T13	A dead pigeon sat on the side of Texas Highway 87.
12285	APW_ENG_20081004.0120.LDC2009T13	A few lonesome pelicans roosted on the remains of a pier jutting into the Gulf of Mexico.
12286	APW_ENG_20081004.0120.LDC2009T13	Otherwise, there weren't many places for a bird to roost.
12287	APW_ENG_20081004.0120.LDC2009T13	"I've got plenty of structure, but it's not mine," Ernest Stone said matter-of-factly, looking at the rubble of his neighbors' homes littering his property.
12288	APW_ENG_20081004.0120.LDC2009T13	His mobile home ended up across the highway.
12289	APW_ENG_20081004.0120.LDC2009T13	The only recognizable parts of it are the wheels, upside down and twisted amid other debris.

12331	APW_ENG_20081008.0710.LDC2009T13	As they moved north they were joined by dozens of other Russian military vehicles, forming a loose column that crossed into South Ossetia about an hour later.
12332	APW_ENG_20081008.0710.LDC2009T13	The vehicles were accompanied as far as the border by two blue light-armored vehicles from the EU mission monitoring the pullout.
12333	APW_ENG_20081008.0710.LDC2009T13	The governor of the Georgian region where Karaleti is located, Vladimir Vardezelashvili, said Georgian police would move in as the Russians withdraw.
12334	APW_ENG_20081008.0710.LDC2009T13	A white pickup truck packed with black- uniformed police carrying Kalashnikovs crossed the former checkpoint.
12335	APW_ENG_20081008.0710.LDC2009T13	EU monitors have been patrolling the buffer zone since Oct. 1 under the withdrawal agreement, a supplement to the initial cease-fire Sarkozy negotiated on behalf of the EU in August.
12336	APW_ENG_20081008.0710.LDC2009T13	Russia has made clear the EU monitors are not welcome in the breakaway regions themselves.
12337	APW_ENG_20081008.0710.LDC2009T13	The head of the EU monitoring mission, Hansjorg Haber, expressed satisfaction with the Russian moves to withdraw.
12338	APW_ENG_20081008.0710.LDC2009T13	"We always proceeded from the assumption that the process would be completed by Friday, and this is confirmation of that assumption," Haber told The Associated Press by telephone from buffer zone outside Abkhazia, where he said there were 12 checkpoints and a base that needed to be evacuated.
12339	APW_ENG_20081008.0710.LDC2009T13	The war erupted Aug. 7, when Georgian forces attacked Tskhinvali, the capital of South Ossetia, which broke away in a war during the early 1990s.
12340	APW_ENG_20081008.0710.LDC2009T13	Russian troops, tanks and warplanes repelled the attack and drove deep into Georgia in Russia's first major military offensive beyond its borders since the 1991 Soviet collapse.
12341	APW_ENG_20081008.0710.LDC2009T13	Russian forces occupied large portions of Georgia for weeks after the war and reinforced positions around the edges of South Ossetia and Abkhazia.

12352	APW_ENG_20081014.1380.LDC2009T13	CHICAGO 2008-10-14 21:50:13 UTC
12353	APW_ENG_20081014.1380.LDC2009T13	One of the largest spam operations in the world, a vast network involving countries from New Zealand to China and the United States, has been shut down, the Federal Trade Commission announced Tuesday.
12354	APW_ENG_20081014.1380.LDC2009T13	The spammers sent out billions of e-mails in recent years encouraging people to click through to Web sites that allegedly used false claims to peddle prescription drugs, as well as "male enhancement" and weight-loss pills.
12355	APW_ENG_20081014.1380.LDC2009T13	The FTC has received more than 3 million complaints about the spam and related Web sites, illustrating the scale of the operation, officials said.
12356	APW_ENG_20081014.1380.LDC2009T13	The sites, including one called "Canadian Healthcare," were difficult to distinguish from legitimate online pharmacies -- making the pitches more persuasive, said Steve Baker, the FTC's Midwest Region director.
12357	APW_ENG_20081014.1380.LDC2009T13	"These sites are really professionally constructed," he said.
12358	APW_ENG_20081014.1380.LDC2009T13	"Some years ago you used to be able to tell the bogus things because they looked cheesy and had misspellings.
12359	APW_ENG_20081014.1380.LDC2009T13	Anymore, I don't think that's true."
12360	APW_ENG_20081014.1380.LDC2009T13	The operation violated the federal CAN-SPAM Act of 2003, meant to restrict commercial spam, by using false header information to hide the origin of messages, not offering an opt-out link and failing to list a postal address, the FTC said.
12361	APW_ENG_20081014.1380.LDC2009T13	The FTC hasn't determined a total sales figure, but it likely to ran into the millions of dollars, Baker said.
12362	APW_ENG_20081014.1380.LDC2009T13	The case should remind consumers to beware of spam, he said.
12363	APW_ENG_20081014.1380.LDC2009T13	"If you find your way to these Web sites through spam, you should really be asking yourself if you can trust them at all," Baker said.
12364	APW_ENG_20081014.1380.LDC2009T13	A federal judge in Chicago issued a temporary injunction to halt the operation and also froze its assets.
12365	APW_ENG_20081014.1380.LDC2009T13	The Federal Bureau of Investigation is investigating and those involved could also face criminal charges, Baker said.
12366	APW_ENG_20081014.1380.LDC2009T13	Those spearheading the enterprise, known as "Affking" on the Internet, included a U.S. and a New Zealand citizen, according to court documents.
12367	APW_ENG_20081014.1380.LDC2009T13	Servers in China hosted the Web sites and the drugs were shipped from India, while operatives in Cyprus and the former Soviet republic of Georgia processed credit card information, Baker said.
12368	APW_ENG_20081014.1380.LDC2009T13	As part of their inquiry, FTC staff made undercover purchases from the sites.
12369	APW_ENG_20081014.1380.LDC2009T13	No one asked the clandestine buyers to provide verification of a prescription and the shipped drugs did not include doctors' instructions or dosage information, officials said.
12370	APW_ENG_20081014.1380.LDC2009T13	Meanwhile, federal prosecutors in Detroit have won their first conviction in a case involving spam e-mail and efforts to manipulate the price of Chinese stocks.
12371	APW_ENG_20081014.1380.LDC2009T13	A 56-year-old East Lansing woman pleaded guilty Tuesday to conspiracy and aiding fraud.
12372	APW_ENG_20081014.1380.LDC2009T13	Judy Devenow is one of 11 people charged with illegally sending spam to generate excitement about Chinese stocks.
12373	APW_ENG_20081014.1380.LDC2009T13	Devenow worked for Alan Ralsky of suburban Detroit, who is accused of running the spam scam.
12374	APW_ENG_20081014.1380.LDC2009T13	Authorities say he made $3 million just in summer 2005 by trading in and out of Chinese stocks on U.S. exchanges.
12375	APW_ENG_20081014.1380.LDC2009T13	Devenow says she was paid $150,000 to send several million e-mails a day from January 2004 through September 2005.
12376	APW_ENG_20081014.1380.LDC2009T13	She has agreed to cooperate with prosecutors against her co-defendants.

12382	APW_ENG_20081015.0711.LDC2009T13	WASHINGTON 2008-10-15 13:32:44 UTC
12383	APW_ENG_20081015.0711.LDC2009T13	Wholesale prices fell for the second straight month in September, but excluding volatile energy and food costs, core prices posted their largest annual gain in more than 17 years.
12384	APW_ENG_20081015.0711.LDC2009T13	The Labor Department said Wednesday that the producer price index, which measures inflation pressures before they reach the consumer, fell 0.4 percent in September after a 0.9 percent drop in August.
12385	APW_ENG_20081015.0711.LDC2009T13	Last month's decline matched analysts' expectations.
12386	APW_ENG_20081015.0711.LDC2009T13	But the 0.4 percent increase in the core rate was above analysts' expectations of a 0.2 percent increase.
12387	APW_ENG_20081015.0711.LDC2009T13	Core wholesale prices also are up 4 percent from last September, the largest increase year-over-year since February 1991.
12388	APW_ENG_20081015.0711.LDC2009T13	The decline in overall wholesale prices could restrain consumer prices in coming months, a bit of good news for the economy.
12389	APW_ENG_20081015.0711.LDC2009T13	Lower inflation makes it easier for the Federal Reserve to cut its target interest rate to stimulate economic growth.
12390	APW_ENG_20081015.0711.LDC2009T13	Many economists expect the Fed to cut rates at its Oct. 28 meeting, if not before.
12391	APW_ENG_20081015.0711.LDC2009T13	The price of natural gas used in homes fell by a record 8.2 percent last month, the department said, while home heating oil fell by 13.9 percent, the steepest drop in two years.
12392	APW_ENG_20081015.0711.LDC2009T13	Wholesale gas prices fell by 0.5 percent in September, the department said.
12393	APW_ENG_20081015.0711.LDC2009T13	Prices at the pump also have fallen sharply to a national average of about $3.16 a gallon (83 cents a liter) down from a record $4.14 ($1.05 a liter) this summer, according to auto club AAA.
12394	APW_ENG_20081015.0711.LDC2009T13	Producer prices rose sharply for three months this summer, as oil prices rose to a record level near $147 a barrel in July and prices of agricultural commodities also soared.
12395	APW_ENG_20081015.0711.LDC2009T13	The impact of those trends can be seen in yearly figures.
12396	APW_ENG_20081015.0711.LDC2009T13	September wholesale prices were 8.7 percent higher than in September 2007.
12397	APW_ENG_20081015.0711.LDC2009T13	That's down from the 9.8 percent year-over-year increase in July, the highest in 27 years.
12398	APW_ENG_20081015.0711.LDC2009T13	Oil prices have dropped below $80 a barrel as the economy has slowed amid the financial crisis.
12399	APW_ENG_20081015.0711.LDC2009T13	The price of corn and other commodities are also down from mid-summer highs.
12400	APW_ENG_20081015.0711.LDC2009T13	The drop in energy prices has hurt the shares of oil companies.

12402	APW_ENG_20081015.0711.LDC2009T13	Some of the drop in wholesale prices has been passed onto consumers.
12403	APW_ENG_20081015.0711.LDC2009T13	The consumer price index fell 0.1 percent in August, the Labor Department said last month.

12425	APW_ENG_20081027.0679.LDC2009T13	The startling U.S. commando attack inside Syrian territory over the weekend appears to amplify an emerging message to countries giving safe passage to terrorists: Take action, or else the U.S. will.
12426	APW_ENG_20081027.0679.LDC2009T13	A U.S. military official in Washington says special forces conducted the raid in Syria on Sunday to target the network of al-Qaida-linked foreign fighters moving through Syria to help fight in the war in Iraq.
12427	APW_ENG_20081027.0679.LDC2009T13	Syria said troops in four helicopters attacked a building and killed eight people, including four children.
12428	APW_ENG_20081027.0679.LDC2009T13	"We are taking matters into our own hands," the U.S. military official in Washington told The Associated Press, speaking on condition of anonymity due to the political sensitivity of cross- border raids.
12429	APW_ENG_20081027.0679.LDC2009T13	Though the flow of foreign fighters from Syria to Iraq has been declining, Americans have been unable to shut down the network in the area struck because Syria was out of the military's reach.
12430	APW_ENG_20081027.0679.LDC2009T13	The move appears to echo one taken recently in America's other current war.
12431	APW_ENG_20081027.0679.LDC2009T13	President George W. Bush in July secretly approved U.S. military raids inside anti-terror ally Pakistan, which has been unwilling or unable to stem the flow of militants hiding in Pakistan and waging cross-border raids into Afghanistan.
12432	APW_ENG_20081027.0679.LDC2009T13	Helicopter-borne U.S. special forces conducted a raid Sept. 3 inside Pakistan -- the only one known so far following Bush's order.
12433	APW_ENG_20081027.0679.LDC2009T13	Islamabad has complained bitterly about the move, which it says killed some two dozen people, including civilians.
12434	APW_ENG_20081027.0679.LDC2009T13	The U.S has become frustrated with the use of Pakistan's northwestern tribal areas as a safe haven for militants nearly seven years since the Taliban was rousted from Afghanistan for harboring Osama bin Laden.
12435	APW_ENG_20081027.0679.LDC2009T13	Defense Department spokesman Bryan Whitman refused to comment Monday on Sunday's attack.
12436	APW_ENG_20081027.0679.LDC2009T13	And other military officials declined to even mention it off the record because of the extreme sensitivity.
12437	APW_ENG_20081027.0679.LDC2009T13	But the raid came just days after the commander of U.S. forces in western Iraq said American troops were redoubling efforts to secure the Syrian border, which he called an "uncontrolled" gateway for fighters entering Iraq.
12438	APW_ENG_20081027.0679.LDC2009T13	Syria called the raid a "serious aggression," and its foreign ministry summoned the charges d'affaires of the United States and Iraq in protest.
12439	APW_ENG_20081027.0679.LDC2009T13	Government newspapers also published scathing criticisms of the raid in Monday's editions.
12440	APW_ENG_20081027.0679.LDC2009T13	Tishrin splashed its front pages with a headline denouncing it as a "U.S. war crime," while Al-Baath newspaper described the attack in an editorial as a "stunning, shocking and unprecedented adventure."
12441	APW_ENG_20081027.0679.LDC2009T13	The area targeted Sunday is near the Iraqi border city of Qaim, which officials have said has been a major crossing point for fighters, weapons and money coming into Iraq to fuel the Sunni insurgency.

12446	APW_ENG_20081028.0395.LDC2009T13	LONDON 2008-10-28 10:41:56 UTC
12447	APW_ENG_20081028.0395.LDC2009T13	Tottenham manager Harry Redknapp has confirmed that he could be interested in signing some of the players he took to Portsmouth before switching clubs at the weekend.
12448	APW_ENG_20081028.0395.LDC2009T13	Redknapp quit Pompey for Spurs late Saturday night and said Tuesday that he could hire some of his former acquisitions when the next transfer window opens on Jan. 1.
12449	APW_ENG_20081028.0395.LDC2009T13	Those players could include midfielder Lassana Diarra, striker Peter Crouch and England forward Jermain Defoe, who left Tottenham for Portsmouth nine months ago and had his name chanted by Spurs fans in Redknapp's first game in charge.
12450	APW_ENG_20081028.0395.LDC2009T13	"If Portsmouth want to sell some of their players, there's an open market," Redknapp said in an interview with BBC Radio 5.
12451	APW_ENG_20081028.0395.LDC2009T13	"They've got some fantastic players there.
12452	APW_ENG_20081028.0395.LDC2009T13	Absolutely top, top players, they really have."
12453	APW_ENG_20081028.0395.LDC2009T13	Spurs are still bottom of the Premier League despite Sunday's 2-0 win over Bolton, a predicament largely due to a failure to score goals and a lack of tenacity in midfield.
12454	APW_ENG_20081028.0395.LDC2009T13	Defoe left Tottenham because he was an irregular pick behind Dimitar Berbatov and Robbie Keane, but his rivals have since left the club and Defoe has hit 14 goals in 21 Premier League matches for Portsmouth.
12455	APW_ENG_20081028.0395.LDC2009T13	Defoe is one of six former Tottenham players at Portsmouth, including Crouch, Sol Campbell and Sean Davis.
12456	APW_ENG_20081028.0395.LDC2009T13	Redknapp, though, said he would not use his relationship with the players as leverage or approach contracted players without permission.

12460	APW_ENG_20081029.0354.LDC2009T13	BRUSSELS, Belgium 2008-10-29 08:12:52 UTC
12461	APW_ENG_20081029.0354.LDC2009T13	EU governments promised to lend Hungary 6.5 billion euros ($8.1 billion) as part of a 20 billion euro ($25 billion) international rescue package to help it weather a financial crisis that has sharply devalued its currency, officials said Wednesday.
12462	APW_ENG_20081029.0354.LDC2009T13	The EU's 27 finance ministers and the European Commission said in a statement that they would join with the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank in helping Hungary.
12463	APW_ENG_20081029.0354.LDC2009T13	The IMF will give 12.5 billion euros ($15.6 billion) and the World Bank another 1 billion euros ($1.25 billion), they said.
12464	APW_ENG_20081029.0354.LDC2009T13	In return for the loan, the EU executive said Hungary had made a "strong commitment" to prudent budget policies that include reducing debt and the yearly budget deficit.
12465	APW_ENG_20081029.0354.LDC2009T13	It did not give details.
12466	APW_ENG_20081029.0354.LDC2009T13	French President Nicolas Sarkozy said Tuesday that EU leaders would likely make a final decision on the loan when they meet for a special summit Nov. 7.
12467	APW_ENG_20081029.0354.LDC2009T13	The EU plans to borrow the money on the capital markets and lend it to Hungary so the loan will not see European governments directly pledge cash to Budapest.
12468	APW_ENG_20081029.0354.LDC2009T13	Over the past few weeks, Hungary's currency -- the forint -- has plunged against the euro and the U.S. dollar while the Budapest Stock Exchange's benchmark BUX reached its lowest point in four years.
12469	APW_ENG_20081029.0354.LDC2009T13	Hungary already carried a large amount of public debt and was running the highest budget deficit in the European Union even before the current turmoil which saw banks shy away from lending and stock prices plummet.
12470	APW_ENG_20081029.0354.LDC2009T13	Hungarian Prime Minister Ferenc Gyurcsany warned Tuesday the economy may shrink by 1 percent this year because of the crisis.
12471	APW_ENG_20081029.0354.LDC2009T13	Volatile exchange rates are a particular problem for Hungarians because many people took out housing loans and other debts in foreign currencies, mostly in Swiss francs and euros, which carry lower interest rates than Hungarian loans.
12472	APW_ENG_20081029.0354.LDC2009T13	The tumbling value of the forint means regular debt payments have now become far more expensive for many people.

12475	APW_ENG_20081031.1305.LDC2009T13	A jury at Guantanamo's second war-crimes trial began deliberating Friday whether al-Qaida's alleged "media secretary" is guilty of war crimes that could put him in prison for life.
12476	APW_ENG_20081031.1305.LDC2009T13	The nine jurors, all Pentagon-approved U.S. military officers, were reviewing the prosecutors' evidence.
12477	APW_ENG_20081031.1305.LDC2009T13	The accused offered no defense after calling the proceedings a "legal farce."
12478	APW_ENG_20081031.1305.LDC2009T13	The prosecution said Ali Hamza al-Balhul's violent propaganda videos helped inspire the Sept. 11 attacks.
12479	APW_ENG_20081031.1305.LDC2009T13	The Yemeni prisoner also helped prepare at least two Sept. 11 hijackers for their mission and instructed many other terrorists through videos he created as a propagandist for al-Qaida in Afghanistan, Army Maj. Daniel Cowhig said.
12480	APW_ENG_20081031.1305.LDC2009T13	"The accused shouted through the medium of video, the Internet, and DVDs: Love death, hate life," Cowhig told the jury of U.S. military officers at the isolated Navy base.
12481	APW_ENG_20081031.1305.LDC2009T13	Al-Bahul refused to present a defense in the weeklong trial, and his Pentagon-appointed lawyer did not speak at all in deference to his client's wishes, declining to answer questions from the judge.
12482	APW_ENG_20081031.1305.LDC2009T13	A Yemeni who was brought to Guantanamo in 2002, al-Bahul is the second prisoner to go through a war crimes trial under the special military commissions system.
12483	APW_ENG_20081031.1305.LDC2009T13	He faces up to life in prison if convicted of conspiracy, supporting terrorism and solicitation to commit murder.
12484	APW_ENG_20081031.1305.LDC2009T13	The military claims al-Bahlul committed war crimes by serving as chief propagandist for al-Qaida and as an aide to its leader, Osama bin Laden.
12485	APW_ENG_20081031.1305.LDC2009T13	Videos made by the defendant were allegedly shown to terrorist recruits at training camps in Afghanistan.
12486	APW_ENG_20081031.1305.LDC2009T13	Cowhig said he also arranged for lead Sept. 11 hijacker Mohamed Atta to swear a loyalty oath to bin Laden, and prepared martyrdom wills for Atta and fellow hijacker Ziad Jarrah in preparation for the attacks against the United States.
12487	APW_ENG_20081031.1305.LDC2009T13	"(These videos) contain the thoughts, the beliefs, the ideals of the accused," the prosecutor said.
12488	APW_ENG_20081031.1305.LDC2009T13	The military says al-Bahlul repeatedly admitted to interrogators that he was al-Qaida's media chief and made propaganda videos for bin Laden.
12489	APW_ENG_20081031.1305.LDC2009T13	Al-Bahlul doesn't consider his actions criminal.
12490	APW_ENG_20081031.1305.LDC2009T13	But the U.S. military already determined him to be an unlawful enemy combatant, and says any work he did for al-Qaida is by definition a war crime because al-Qaida is a terrorist organization.
12491	APW_ENG_20081031.1305.LDC2009T13	At one point, al-Bahlul smiled broadly as the uniformed prosecutor directly addressed the defendant.
12492	APW_ENG_20081031.1305.LDC2009T13	"The accused identifies himself as an officer of al-Qaida," Cowhig said, looking at the slight man with a close-cropped beard.
12493	APW_ENG_20081031.1305.LDC2009T13	"Al-Qaida is not an army, and you are not an officer."
12494	APW_ENG_20081031.1305.LDC2009T13	The judge, Air Force Col. Ronald Gregory, quickly ordered Cowhig to stop addressing the defendant and instead turn his attention to the jurors.
12495	APW_ENG_20081031.1305.LDC2009T13	Jamil Dakwar, an American Civil Liberties Union lawyer who has been observing the trial, said the prosecution failed to prove al-Bahlul has any real connection to the Sept. 11 attacks.
12496	APW_ENG_20081031.1305.LDC2009T13	"It is an injustice to the victims of 9-11 for the government to build its case solely by videos and images of the attacks," Dakwar said.

12507	APW_ENG_20081103.0495.LDC2009T13	This year Felipe had two races that will remain in the history of his growing career.
12508	APW_ENG_20081103.0495.LDC2009T13	One was Hungary, where unfortunately we had a problem but he was really fantastic," Domenicali said on Ferrari's Web site, referring to when Massa's engine blew while he was leading with three laps to go.

12516	APW_ENG_20081111.0481.LDC2009T13	An Islamic militia that the U.S. considers a terrorist organization took over two strategic towns in Somalia on Tuesday, the latest territory grab by a strengthening insurgency, officials said.
12517	APW_ENG_20081111.0481.LDC2009T13	The militia, al-Shabab, seized El Dheer in central Somalia and Qoryoley in the south as part of a burgeoning campaign to take territory nominally held by the weak U.N.-backed government and its Ethiopian allies.
12518	APW_ENG_20081111.0481.LDC2009T13	The new seizures give the group a strategic base in central Somalia, where it controls Kismayo, the third- largest city.
12519	APW_ENG_20081111.0481.LDC2009T13	Al-Shabab, which means "the youth," is the military wing of Union of Islamic Courts, an Islamic party that ruled much of the country in the second half of 2006 and aims to impose Islamic sharia law in Somalia.

12523	APW_ENG_20081111.0481.LDC2009T13	The town is 210 miles (340 kilometers) north of the capital of Mogadishu.

12526	APW_ENG_20081111.0481.LDC2009T13	In a separate attack, nearly 1,000 insurgents seized Qoryoley in southern Somalia from militias loyal to Somalia's crumbling government.

12535	APW_ENG_20081112.1192.LDC2009T13	The road that leads into rebel-controlled Congo begins with a makeshift roadblock made from the corpses of two government soldiers strewn across the dark volcanic earth.
12536	APW_ENG_20081112.1192.LDC2009T13	The pair on Wednesday blocked the main two-lane track running north from the regional capital, Goma -- one with a bullet in his forehead and a frozen fist grasping the air above.
12537	APW_ENG_20081112.1192.LDC2009T13	The scene was meant as a warning to government troops just a few hundred yards down the road whom the rebels had battled the night before.
12538	APW_ENG_20081112.1192.LDC2009T13	And for the few fearful civilians trickling past the frontline, it was clear message that Congo's savage war is not easing amid fears it could draw in Angola and others in the region.
12539	APW_ENG_20081112.1192.LDC2009T13	"We don't want any more of it," said 18-year-old John Biamungu, who pushed a wooden bicycle past the corpse-strewn checkpoint as rebels stood in a clutch of trees on both sides staring silently.
12540	APW_ENG_20081112.1192.LDC2009T13	Years of sporadic violence in eastern Congo intensified in August, and fighting between the army and fighters loyal to rebel leader Laurent Nkunda has displaced at least 250,000 people since then -- despite the presence of the largest U.N. peacekeeping force in the world.

12571	APW_ENG_20081112.1192.LDC2009T13	"When we get orders to attack, we will," said Congolese army Capt. Alex Kazadi, as a couple soldiers cooked stews in the fields behind him, the steam from boiling water evaporating into the chilly air.
12572	APW_ENG_20081112.1192.LDC2009T13	"This has gone on too long."
12573	APW_ENG_20081112.1192.LDC2009T13	The rebels, however, are far more disciplined on the battlefield than Congo's ill-trained army, which was forced into a humiliating retreat in late October as Nkunda's forces advanced toward Goma and suddenly halted.

12581	APW_ENG_20081112.1192.LDC2009T13	Tuesday's fighting, which lasted nearly an hour, sent some families rushing for what they hoped was the safety of refugee camps.

12596	APW_ENG_20081113.0888.LDC2009T13	Sarah Palin called on fellow Republican governors Thursday to keep the new president and his strengthened Democratic majority in check on issues from taxes to health care.
12597	APW_ENG_20081113.0888.LDC2009T13	Addressing the Republican Governors Association, the vice presidential nominee on Senator John McCain's ticket -- and an oft-mentioned candidate for 2012 -- talked about the role of the party's state governors after the Republicans lost the White House and several seats in the Senate and House.
12598	APW_ENG_20081113.0888.LDC2009T13	"We are the minority party," Palin said.
12599	APW_ENG_20081113.0888.LDC2009T13	"Let us resolve not to be the negative party."
12600	APW_ENG_20081113.0888.LDC2009T13	Palin never mentioned the name of President-elect Barack Obama, but she took a swipe or two at the Democrat.
12601	APW_ENG_20081113.0888.LDC2009T13	She said with governors, "the buck stops on our desk.
12602	APW_ENG_20081113.0888.LDC2009T13	... We are not the many voting yea or nay or present."
12603	APW_ENG_20081113.0888.LDC2009T13	While an Illinois state lawmaker, Obama often voted "present," a practice the Republicans criticized during the campaign.
12604	APW_ENG_20081113.0888.LDC2009T13	Palin noted Congress said it was incumbent upon Republican governors to ensure that the Democratic-led federal government doesn't take over the health care system.
12605	APW_ENG_20081113.0888.LDC2009T13	She said if Obama and the new Congress "err on the side of excess taxes, we have to show them the way."
12606	APW_ENG_20081113.0888.LDC2009T13	Facing the prospect of being out of power at both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue for the first time since 1992, Republicans are looking to their governors to fill the leadership vacuum.
12607	APW_ENG_20081113.0888.LDC2009T13	Speculation has centered on the telegenic Palin despite her tumultuous two months on the national political scene.
12608	APW_ENG_20081113.0888.LDC2009T13	She likely would have competition for a possible 2012 bid from several of the governors attending the three-day meeting.
12609	APW_ENG_20081113.0888.LDC2009T13	One likely candidate Mississippi Governor Haley Barbour told his colleagues Wednesday that now isn't the time to think about the next presidential election.

12611	APW_ENG_20081113.0888.LDC2009T13	"We don't need to talk about 2012."
12612	APW_ENG_20081113.0888.LDC2009T13	In a series of national television interviews, Palin did not rule out seeking the presidency, saying, "It's crazy to close a door before you know what's even open in front of you."
12613	APW_ENG_20081113.0888.LDC2009T13	Asked about the 2012 talk at a news conference Thursday morning, Palin said, "I, like all of our governors, we're focused on the future.
12614	APW_ENG_20081113.0888.LDC2009T13	The future for us is not the 2012 presidential race.
12615	APW_ENG_20081113.0888.LDC2009T13	It's next year and our next budget, and the next reforms in our states and in 2010 we're going to have 36 governors' positions open across the U.S. That's what we're focused on."

12802	APW_ENG_20081121.1345.LDC2009T13	NEW YORK 2008-11-21 23:40:14 UTC
12803	APW_ENG_20081121.1345.LDC2009T13	Wall Street put a stop to a terrifying decline and stormed higher Friday as President-elect Barack Obama appeared ready to tap the chief of the New York Federal Reserve as the next treasury secretary and hand him the herculean task of righting the U.S. financial system.
12804	APW_ENG_20081121.1345.LDC2009T13	The Dow Jones industrial average, which had broken even for the day until news of the nomination leaked about an hour before the close, raced upward and finished 494 points higher, a rally of more than 6 1/2 percent.
12805	APW_ENG_20081121.1345.LDC2009T13	The outbreak of buying pushed the Dow above 8,000 -- a figure that would have seemed like a nightmare three months ago but on Friday was a relief for Americans who have watched their investments and retirement savings drain away with alarming speed.
12806	APW_ENG_20081121.1345.LDC2009T13	In the two previous days, the Dow had lost a staggering 873 points, more than 10 percent of its value, and the broader Standard &amp
12807	APW_ENG_20081121.1345.LDC2009T13	Poor's 500 index had sunk to its lowest level since 1997.
12808	APW_ENG_20081121.1345.LDC2009T13	The turnaround came when word reached Wall Street that Obama was likely to nominate New York Fed president Timothy Geithner, 47, for treasury secretary.
12809	APW_ENG_20081121.1345.LDC2009T13	Geithner would assume top responsibility for tackling what threatens to be the deepest recession in a generation.
12810	APW_ENG_20081121.1345.LDC2009T13	Financial markets despise uncertainty, and investors were looking for a clear message from Obama on who will make up his economic brain trust.
12811	APW_ENG_20081121.1345.LDC2009T13	Wall Street had been voicing increasing frustration with Henry Paulson, the current treasury secretary, over his erratic handling of the federal financial rescue system.
12812	APW_ENG_20081121.1345.LDC2009T13	"Something needed to be done on the economy," said Ben Halliburton, chief investment officer at Tradition Capital Management.
12813	APW_ENG_20081121.1345.LDC2009T13	"The fact that they've got the team together, maybe that is going to shorten the period of indecision."
12814	APW_ENG_20081121.1345.LDC2009T13	Elsewhere, the government continued its efforts to shore up the financial system.
12815	APW_ENG_20081121.1345.LDC2009T13	The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. also said it would guarantee up to $1.4 trillion in U.S. bank debt for more than three years as part of the government's financial rescue plan.
12816	APW_ENG_20081121.1345.LDC2009T13	The decision is aimed at breaking the logjam of bank-to-bank lending.
12817	APW_ENG_20081121.1345.LDC2009T13	The health of the economy depends on the free flow of credit, and credit markets cinched up again as the market plunged earlier this week.
12818	APW_ENG_20081121.1345.LDC2009T13	The Friday afternoon rally managed to prevent the week from being one of the few most dismal in Wall Street history.
12819	APW_ENG_20081121.1345.LDC2009T13	Corporate mainstays running the gamut from Gap Inc. to Alcoa Inc. and Walt Disney Co. to Microsoft Corp. surged by double-digit amounts.

12825	APW_ENG_20081121.1345.LDC2009T13	But the S&amp

12831	APW_ENG_20081121.1345.LDC2009T13	Geithner worked at the Treasury Department for 13 years, leaving in 2001.
12832	APW_ENG_20081121.1345.LDC2009T13	People close to him say he is motivated by difficult challenges.
12833	APW_ENG_20081121.1345.LDC2009T13	Justin Rudelson, a friend of Geithner's from Dartmouth College, said he asked Geithner in June whether he was getting enough sleep.

12835	APW_ENG_20081121.1345.LDC2009T13	We live for these kinds of crises,'" Rudelson recalled.
12836	APW_ENG_20081121.1345.LDC2009T13	While a Geithner appointment could remove the cloud of uncertainty surrounding Obama's economic team has been removed, there are still plenty of unknowns facing the market.
12837	APW_ENG_20081121.1345.LDC2009T13	As a result, volatility will remain a major force on Wall Street for some time to come, said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Harris Private Bank in Chicago.
12838	APW_ENG_20081121.1345.LDC2009T13	He said worries about marquee companies from General Motors to Citigroup are unnerving investors.

12854	APW_ENG_20081122.0090.LDC2009T13	The announcement comes just days after Ford chief executive Alan Mulally, Chrysler LLC chief executive Robert Nardelli and General Motors Corp. chief executive Rick Wagoner traveled to Washington on separate corporate jets to seek $25 billion in government loans to help them make it through the worst U.S. auto sales downturn in 25 years.
12855	APW_ENG_20081122.0090.LDC2009T13	Congress, though, abandoned a vote on the bailout after a disastrous appearance in which the automakers were criticized for lavish corporate travel, as well as for having poor business plans and high labor costs that some members said would keep them from being competitive with Toyota Motor Corp. and Honda Motor Co.
12856	APW_ENG_20081122.0090.LDC2009T13	Corporations typically lease planes, buy them or charter aircraft to transport executives and other employees.
12857	APW_ENG_20081122.0090.LDC2009T13	Many require executives to travel by corporate jet for security reasons and so they can meet with other executives and do work while traveling.
12858	APW_ENG_20081122.0090.LDC2009T13	Truby said that of the five remaining jets, three are used for executive travel, while the other two shuttle employees such as engineers to factories where new products are being launched.
12859	APW_ENG_20081122.0090.LDC2009T13	"We have been and continue to look at all of our operations to reduce costs and operate more efficiently," he said.
12860	APW_ENG_20081122.0090.LDC2009T13	GM said Thursday that it was in the process of returning two of its five leased corporate jets to the leasing company.
12861	APW_ENG_20081122.0090.LDC2009T13	Spokesman Tom Wilkinson said the company planned to return the jets because travel spending had been cut.
12862	APW_ENG_20081122.0090.LDC2009T13	The jets were scheduled to be returned even before the automakers were criticized in Washington, he said.
12863	APW_ENG_20081122.0090.LDC2009T13	"It would have been done anyway," Wilkinson said.
12864	APW_ENG_20081122.0090.LDC2009T13	"It's just the travel cutbacks have been so severe.
12865	APW_ENG_20081122.0090.LDC2009T13	It's just not being used."
12866	APW_ENG_20081122.0090.LDC2009T13	GM started the year with seven leased jets but returned two of them in September, Wilkinson said.

12871	APW_ENG_20081129.0198.LDC2009T13	GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip 2008-11-29 08:38:50 UTC
12872	APW_ENG_20081129.0198.LDC2009T13	The Islamic militant Hamas on Saturday claimed responsibility for a mortar attack on an Israeli army base that injured eight Israeli soldiers.
12873	APW_ENG_20081129.0198.LDC2009T13	The mortar shells were fired from Hamas-ruled Gaza late Friday at an army base along Israel's border with territory.
12874	APW_ENG_20081129.0198.LDC2009T13	The Israeli military said eight soldiers were hurt, including two who were in serious condition.
12875	APW_ENG_20081129.0198.LDC2009T13	The attack came after more than three weeks of renewed cross- border fighting.
12876	APW_ENG_20081129.0198.LDC2009T13	Israel and Hamas had agreed to a cease-fire in June, but the truce started to unravel in early November, following an Israeli cross-border raid.
12877	APW_ENG_20081129.0198.LDC2009T13	Israel has kept Gaza's borders closed since Nov. 5 to try to pressure militants to halt the attacks.
12878	APW_ENG_20081129.0198.LDC2009T13	Immediately after the attack, another militant group, the Popular Resistance Committees, claimed responsibility.
12879	APW_ENG_20081129.0198.LDC2009T13	Some militants belong to both groups, and it is common for rival militant groups to claim responsibility for the same attack.
12880	APW_ENG_20081129.0198.LDC2009T13	It was not immediately possible to confirm either claim.
12881	APW_ENG_20081129.0494.LDC2009T13	US sets melamine standard for baby formula
12882	APW_ENG_20081129.0494.LDC2009T13	WASHINGTON 2008-11-29 16:51:08 UTC
12883	APW_ENG_20081129.0494.LDC2009T13	Two months ago, U.S. food regulators said they were unable to set a safety threshold for the industrial chemical melamine in baby formula.
12884	APW_ENG_20081129.0494.LDC2009T13	Now, however, they found a way to settle on a standard that allows for higher levels than those found in U.S.-made batches of the product.
12885	APW_ENG_20081129.0494.LDC2009T13	Officials at the regulatory Food and Drug Administration on Friday set a threshold of 1 part per million of melamine in formula, provided a related chemical is not present.
12886	APW_ENG_20081129.0494.LDC2009T13	They insisted the formulas are safe.
12887	APW_ENG_20081129.0494.LDC2009T13	The development comes days after The Associated Press reported that FDA tests found traces of melamine in the infant formula of one major U.S. manufacturer and cyanuric acid, a chemical relative, in the formula of a second major maker.
12888	APW_ENG_20081129.0494.LDC2009T13	The contaminated samples, which both measured at levels below the new standard, were analyzed several weeks ago.
12889	APW_ENG_20081129.0494.LDC2009T13	The FDA had said in early October it was unable to set a safety contamination level for melamine in infant formula.
12890	APW_ENG_20081129.0494.LDC2009T13	Dr. Stephen Sundlof, the FDA's director of food safety, said Friday the agency was confident in the 1 part per million level for either of the chemicals alone, even though there have been no new scientific studies since October that would give regulators more safety data.
12891	APW_ENG_20081129.0494.LDC2009T13	He had no ready explanation for why the level was not set earlier.
12892	APW_ENG_20081129.0494.LDC2009T13	The standard is the same as the one public health officials have set in Canada and China, but is 20 times higher than the most stringent level in Taiwan.
12893	APW_ENG_20081129.0494.LDC2009T13	The problem of melamine in infant formula first surfaced in China in September.
12894	APW_ENG_20081129.0494.LDC2009T13	Sundlof said the lack of dual contamination was key because studies so far show dangerous health effects only when both chemicals are present.
12895	APW_ENG_20081129.0494.LDC2009T13	He emphasized that neither of the two tainted samples had both contaminants.
12896	APW_ENG_20081129.0494.LDC2009T13	The agency still will not set a safety level for melamine if cyanuric acid is also present, he said.
12897	APW_ENG_20081129.0494.LDC2009T13	Both the new safety level and the amount of the chemical found in U.S.-made infant formula are far below the amounts of melamine added to infant formula in China that have been blamed for killing at least three babies and making thousands ill.
12898	APW_ENG_20081129.0494.LDC2009T13	"The levels were so low ... that they do not cause a health risk to infants," Sundlof said.
12899	APW_ENG_20081129.0494.LDC2009T13	A scientist for a national consumer group said it was irresponsible of FDA to assure the public that infant formula is safe based on tests of only 74 samples, especially since cyanuric acid is a byproduct of melamine, making it likely that they will be found together.
12900	APW_ENG_20081129.0494.LDC2009T13	"This is a slippery slope of rationalization by FDA," said Urvashi Rangan, a senior scientist with the Consumers Union in New York.
12901	APW_ENG_20081129.0494.LDC2009T13	"FDA needs to get a handle on how widespread the problem is and, most important, if both these chemicals are occurring in any products.
12902	APW_ENG_20081129.0494.LDC2009T13	They just haven't tested enough to know that yet."
12903	APW_ENG_20081129.0494.LDC2009T13	Earlier this week, members of Congress and the Illinois attorney general demanded a national recall, something FDA said made no sense because it had no evidence suggesting that the formula would be dangerous for babies at the levels of contamination found.
12904	APW_ENG_20081129.0494.LDC2009T13	After saying it made an error in its data, the FDA on Wednesday produced these results: Mead Johnson's Infant Formula Powder, Enfamil LIPIL with Iron found melamine at levels of 0.137 and 0.14 parts per million.
12905	APW_ENG_20081129.0494.LDC2009T13	Three tests of Nestle's Good Start Supreme Infant Formula with Iron detected an average of 0.247 parts per million of cyanuric acid.
12906	APW_ENG_20081129.0494.LDC2009T13	Separately, a third major formula maker -- Abbott Laboratories, whose brands include Similac -- told AP that in-house tests had detected trace levels of melamine in its infant formula.
12907	APW_ENG_20081129.0494.LDC2009T13	Those levels were below what FDA found in the other formulas, an Abbott spokesman said, and below any national safety guidelines.
12908	APW_ENG_20081129.0494.LDC2009T13	Abbott Laboratories, Nestle and Mead Johnson make more than 90 percent of all infant formula produced in the United States
12909	APW_ENG_20081129.0494.LDC2009T13	The FDA and other experts have said they believe the melamine contamination in U.S.-made formula had occurred during the manufacturing process, rather than intentionally.
12910	APW_ENG_20081129.0494.LDC2009T13	The U.S. government quietly began testing domestically produced infant formula in September, soon after problems with melamine-spiked formula surfaced in China.
12911	APW_ENG_20081129.0494.LDC2009T13	Melamine can legally be used in some food packaging, and can rub off into food from there.
12912	APW_ENG_20081129.0494.LDC2009T13	It's also part of a cleaning solution used on some food processing equipment.

12922	APW_ENG_20081202.0201.LDC2009T13	Saying he has "lived a blessed time," Sen. Edward Kennedy smiled broadly and flashed a thumbs up as he accepted an honorary degree from his alma mater during a rare special convocation at Harvard University.
12923	APW_ENG_20081202.0201.LDC2009T13	The 76-year-old senator walked onstage Monday to a standing ovation and leaned lightly on a cane.
12924	APW_ENG_20081202.0201.LDC2009T13	He made no mention of his battle with cancer but sounded a reflective note toward the end of his eight-minute address.
12925	APW_ENG_20081202.0201.LDC2009T13	"We know the future will outlast all of us, but I believe that all of us will live on in the future we make," Kennedy said.

12928	APW_ENG_20081202.0201.LDC2009T13	In being honored at a special convocation, Kennedy joins a select group that includes George Washington, Winston Churchill and Nelson Mandela.
12929	APW_ENG_20081202.0201.LDC2009T13	Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer, a former Kennedy staffer, spoke at the ceremony, and Vice President-elect Joe Biden was among those in attendance.

12931	APW_ENG_20081202.0201.LDC2009T13	Kennedy devoted nearly a third of his speech to the election of Barack Obama, describing the election of the first African- American head of state as a giant step forward in U.S. history, and one that marks a new beginning for the country.
12932	APW_ENG_20081202.0201.LDC2009T13	He said he was "proud to have played a small part" in the historic election.
12933	APW_ENG_20081202.0201.LDC2009T13	Kennedy gave Obama a key endorsement during his hard-fought Democratic primary against Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton.
12934	APW_ENG_20081202.0201.LDC2009T13	"There is no other time when I would rather receive this honor than this year -- at this turning point in American history," he said.
12935	APW_ENG_20081202.0201.LDC2009T13	Kennedy also defended his reputation as the "liberal lion" of the Senate, where he has served for 46 years.
12936	APW_ENG_20081202.0201.LDC2009T13	He quoted his brother, former President John F. Kennedy, saying: "If by a liberal, they mean someone who looks ahead and not behind ... someone who cares about the welfare of the people -- their health, their housing, their schools, their jobs, their civil rights ... then I am proud to say I am a liberal."
12937	APW_ENG_20081202.0201.LDC2009T13	Kennedy graduated from Harvard in 1956 and was elected to the Senate six years later to fill the seat held by his brother before he was elected president.

12940	APW_ENG_20081202.0201.LDC2009T13	"He'd say be generous with the credit," Breyer said, "If you're successful there'll be plenty of credit to go around, and if you're not successful, who wants credit for that?"

12949	APW_ENG_20081208.0504.LDC2009T13	Running battles between riot police firing tear gas and about 400 high school students throwing rocks also broke out Monday morning in Veria, a town about 40 miles (60 kilometers) west of Thessaloniki.
12950	APW_ENG_20081208.0504.LDC2009T13	Violence was reported in the central city of Trikala, where one police officer was reportedly injured, while authorities braced for more possible riots during demonstrations planned across the country, including in Athens, in the central city of Larissa and on the island of Corfu.
12951	APW_ENG_20081208.0504.LDC2009T13	In the capital, high school students blocked streets across the city to protest the 15-year-old's death, while dozens of youths were still barricaded at two university campuses in Athens.

13026	APW_ENG_20081211.1141.LDC2009T13	Lukoil, Russia's largest privately owned oil company, said Thursday that third-quarter profit rose by 40 percent as the company benefited from soaring oil prices and high refining margins.
13027	APW_ENG_20081211.1141.LDC2009T13	Lukoil, which is 20-percent owned by U.S. oil major ConocoPhillips, said net profit for the quarter reached $3.5 billion, up from $2.5 billion for the same period last year.
13028	APW_ENG_20081211.1141.LDC2009T13	But the company warned that a worsening economic environment, which has seen oil prices plummet by 70 percent since July, signals a difficult period ahead for oil companies.
13029	APW_ENG_20081211.1141.LDC2009T13	"Crude oil prices are now close to the level at which development of many oilfields becomes unprofitable," said Lukoil in a statement.

13033	APW_ENG_20081215.0125.LDC2009T13	WASILLA, Alaska 2008-12-15 03:03:48 UTC
13034	APW_ENG_20081215.0125.LDC2009T13	Members of Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin's church gathered in high spirits at a middle school Sunday, two days after their building was badly damaged by a fire authorities are investigating as arson.
13035	APW_ENG_20081215.0125.LDC2009T13	Palin, the former Republican vice presidential candidate, did not attend services Sunday because she was in Juneau preparing to propose a state budget, said her spokesman, Bill McAllister.
13036	APW_ENG_20081215.0125.LDC2009T13	The congregation realizes the church is more than the building, said John Doak, associate pastor at Wasilla Bible Church.
13037	APW_ENG_20081215.0125.LDC2009T13	"The definition of the church is the body of Christ, made up of God's people," Doak said after the hourlong service at Wasilla Middle School attended by about 1,200 people.
13038	APW_ENG_20081215.0125.LDC2009T13	"The church is still there.
13039	APW_ENG_20081215.0125.LDC2009T13	We are the church."
13040	APW_ENG_20081215.0125.LDC2009T13	Damage to the 2 1/2-year-old church building is estimated at $1 million.
13041	APW_ENG_20081215.0125.LDC2009T13	The blaze was set at the main entrance Friday night while a small group, including two children, were inside.
13042	APW_ENG_20081215.0125.LDC2009T13	No one was injured.
13043	APW_ENG_20081215.0125.LDC2009T13	Fire Chief James Steele said the blaze is being investigated as an arson.
13044	APW_ENG_20081215.0125.LDC2009T13	Patsy Inks said the news initially shocked and frustrated her.
13045	APW_ENG_20081215.0125.LDC2009T13	But by Sunday, she was feeling blessed, she said at the school, where worshippers lingered over a potluck dinner for a church family leaving Alaska.
13046	APW_ENG_20081215.0125.LDC2009T13	"This tragedy has brought us all together," Inks said, her eyes tearing up.
13047	APW_ENG_20081215.0125.LDC2009T13	Palin, who was not at the church at the time of the fire, stopped by Saturday.
13048	APW_ENG_20081215.0125.LDC2009T13	According to McAllister, Palin told an assistant pastor she was sorry if the fire was connected to the "undeserved negative attention" the church has received since she became the vice presidential candidate Aug. 29.
13049	APW_ENG_20081215.0125.LDC2009T13	Worshippers acknowledged the possible Palin connection with the fire, but more in a "gee, maybe" sort of way, said Rob Tracy, who shuttled people to the school for services.
13050	APW_ENG_20081215.0125.LDC2009T13	But people are speculating about other motives.
13051	APW_ENG_20081215.0125.LDC2009T13	"It's just as likely to be some troubled person who has a beef with God," Tracy said.
13052	APW_ENG_20081215.0125.LDC2009T13	"Or some local punks," Doak said.
13053	APW_ENG_20081215.0125.LDC2009T13	After Palin was named John McCain's running mate, the evangelical church was the subject of intense scrutiny.
13054	APW_ENG_20081215.0125.LDC2009T13	Early in her campaign, Palin's church was criticized for promoting in a Sunday bulletin a Focus on the Family "Love Won Out Conference" in Anchorage.
13055	APW_ENG_20081215.0125.LDC2009T13	The conference promised to "help men and women dissatisfied with living homosexually understand that same-sex attractions can be overcome."

13058	APW_ENG_20081215.0640.LDC2009T13	SPRINGFIELD, Illinois 2008-12-15 14:33:54 UTC
13059	APW_ENG_20081215.0640.LDC2009T13	Illinois lawmakers could begin impeachment proceedings Monday against Gov. Rod Blagojevich, who has been accused of seeking bribes for the Senate seat vacated by President-elect Barack Obama.
13060	APW_ENG_20081215.0640.LDC2009T13	State legislators were to meet Monday afternoon for the first time since Blagojevich was arrested last week on charges related to the Senate seat and that he tried to get businesses seeking state deals to pay up.
13061	APW_ENG_20081215.0640.LDC2009T13	As governor, Blagojevich holds the power to appoint a new U.S. senator representing the state.
13062	APW_ENG_20081215.0640.LDC2009T13	The session's focus was supposed to be about considering a special election, but impeachment is likely to be the chief topic of conversation.
13063	APW_ENG_20081215.0640.LDC2009T13	Republicans and Democrats alike were calling for the state lawmakers to act quickly.
13064	APW_ENG_20081215.0640.LDC2009T13	"The General Assembly must move to impeach Rod Blagojevich immediately," said DuPage County State's Attorney Joe Birkett, a potential Republican candidate for governor in 2010.
13065	APW_ENG_20081215.0640.LDC2009T13	"We should have started yesterday," agreed Democratic Rep. Jack Franks.
13066	APW_ENG_20081215.0640.LDC2009T13	Blagojevich emerged briefly from his house early Monday but answered no questions from reporters.
13067	APW_ENG_20081215.0640.LDC2009T13	Spokesman Lucio Guerrero said the governor "has no plans on resigning Monday."
13068	APW_ENG_20081215.0640.LDC2009T13	Guerrero didn't respond directly to whether the governor could or would do anything to slow down the Legislature's move toward impeachment.
13069	APW_ENG_20081215.0640.LDC2009T13	"The governor has indicated in the past there is more to this story that he's wanting to tell at an appropriate time," he said.
13070	APW_ENG_20081215.0640.LDC2009T13	The calls for impeachment put the spotlight on House Speaker Michael Madigan, who ultimately will decide the timing of any impeachment effort.
13071	APW_ENG_20081215.0640.LDC2009T13	Madigan, a Democrat representing Chicago, hasn't taken any public position beyond saying Sunday that he will talk to the House Republican leader about the issue Monday.
13072	APW_ENG_20081215.0640.LDC2009T13	David Dring, spokesman for House Minority Leader Tom Cross, said Republicans will step up the pressure on Democrats to remove their fellow party member Blagojevich, perhaps raising the issue on the House floor.
13073	APW_ENG_20081215.0640.LDC2009T13	"If they won't work with us, you'll probably see some good theater," Dring said.
13074	APW_ENG_20081215.0640.LDC2009T13	The Republicans also plan to run television ads pressuring Democrats to approve a special election to replace Obama.
13075	APW_ENG_20081215.0640.LDC2009T13	Blagojevich still holds the power to appoint a new senator, and if he resigned, that power would go to Democratic Lt. Gov. Patrick Quinn.
13076	APW_ENG_20081215.0640.LDC2009T13	Madigan often has clashed with the Democratic governor, and his office produced a memo this year outlining all the arguments legislative candidates could make in favor of impeachment.
13077	APW_ENG_20081215.0640.LDC2009T13	But spokesman Steve Brown wouldn't say Sunday whether Madigan was even considering impeachment proceedings.
13078	APW_ENG_20081215.0640.LDC2009T13	Brown said Madigan wants to "maintain some neutrality" in case he winds up presiding over an impeachment.
13079	APW_ENG_20081215.0640.LDC2009T13	Madigan's daughter, Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan, has asked the state Supreme Court to remove Blagojevich from office, claiming he is unfit to serve.
13080	APW_ENG_20081215.0640.LDC2009T13	Madigan said Sunday she expects word on whether the court will hear her request "probably just in a few days."
13081	APW_ENG_20081215.0640.LDC2009T13	Lisa Madigan is considered one of the top Democratic candidates for governor in 2010.
13082	APW_ENG_20081215.0640.LDC2009T13	The state constitution gives lawmakers broad authority to impeach a governor for any reason they consider sufficient.
13083	APW_ENG_20081215.0640.LDC2009T13	The House would decide whether to file charges against the governor, and the Senate would ultimately rule on them.
13084	APW_ENG_20081215.0640.LDC2009T13	Democrats first made the call for a special election, but some are now having second thoughts.
13085	APW_ENG_20081215.0640.LDC2009T13	U.S. Sen. Dick Durbin, for instance, was an early supporter, but the Illinois Democrat is now calling for Blagojevich to resign so that the lieutenant governor could appoint a senator.
13086	APW_ENG_20081215.0640.LDC2009T13	Opponents of a special election cite the time and expense.
13087	APW_ENG_20081215.0640.LDC2009T13	It would cost tens of millions of dollars and not produce a new senator until April.
13088	APW_ENG_20081215.0640.LDC2009T13	Republicans claim Democrats are wavering because they don't want to risk a Republican candidate winning the special election.

13093	APW_ENG_20081216.0158.LDC2009T13	Canada's Research in Motion and South Korea's SK Telecom announced Tuesday the launch of corporate service for the Blackberry Bold smartphone, which will be available in South Korea via a local network for the first time.
13094	APW_ENG_20081216.0158.LDC2009T13	The two companies said in a press release that the device was expected to be available on the market by the end of the month.
13095	APW_ENG_20081216.0158.LDC2009T13	Plans were to target both foreign and domestic companies, it said.
13096	APW_ENG_20081216.0158.LDC2009T13	Use of the Blackberry and other foreign smart phones has been hampered by a South Korean rule that required all mobile devices to carry special software adapted to South Korea's wireless Internet platform.
13097	APW_ENG_20081216.0158.LDC2009T13	An exception to that requirement was made earlier this year, paving the way for the Blackberry Bold's arrival, though so far only corporate customers will be allowed to sign up for service.
13098	APW_ENG_20081216.0158.LDC2009T13	The Korean Communications Commission announced last week that the rule will be abolished from April 1, which could entice foreign smart phone makers -- which have shied away because of the extra cost involved in modifying their phones -- to enter South Korea and potentially target retail customers.
13099	APW_ENG_20081216.0158.LDC2009T13	The release did not mention whether Waterloo, Ontario-based Research in Motion Ltd. and SK telecom Co., headquartered in Seoul, planned to market the Blackberry to individuals after April 1.
13100	APW_ENG_20081216.0158.LDC2009T13	The South Korean mobile device market is dominated by Samsung Electronics Co. and LG Electronics Inc.

13114	APW_ENG_20081218.0897.LDC2009T13	Bush considering `orderly ' auto bankruptcy
13115	APW_ENG_20081218.0897.LDC2009T13	WASHINGTON 2008-12-18 16:25:14 UTC
13116	APW_ENG_20081218.0897.LDC2009T13	The Bush administration is seriously considering "orderly" bankruptcy as a way of dealing with the desperately ailing U.S. auto industry.
13117	APW_ENG_20081218.0897.LDC2009T13	White House press secretary Dana Perino said Thursday, "There's an orderly way to do bankruptcies that provides for more of a soft landing.
13118	APW_ENG_20081218.0897.LDC2009T13	I think that's what we would be talking about."
13119	APW_ENG_20081218.0897.LDC2009T13	President George W. Bush, asked about an auto rescue plan during an appearance before a private group, said he had not decided what he would do.
13120	APW_ENG_20081218.0897.LDC2009T13	But he, like Perino, spoke of the idea of bankruptcies organized by the federal government as a possible way to go.
13121	APW_ENG_20081218.0897.LDC2009T13	"Under normal circumstances, no question bankruptcy court is the best way to work through credit and debt and restructuring," he said.
13122	APW_ENG_20081218.0897.LDC2009T13	"These aren't normal circumstances.
13123	APW_ENG_20081218.0897.LDC2009T13	That's the problem."
13124	APW_ENG_20081218.0897.LDC2009T13	At the White House, Perino said, "The president is not going to allow a disorderly collapse of the companies.
13125	APW_ENG_20081218.0897.LDC2009T13	A disorderly collapse would be something very chaotic that is a shock to the system."
13126	APW_ENG_20081218.0897.LDC2009T13	She said the White House was close to a decision and emphasized there were still several possible approaches to assisting the automakers, such as short-term loans out of a $700 billion Wall Street rescue fund.
13127	APW_ENG_20081218.0897.LDC2009T13	Bush has resisted this approach before, and it is adamantly opposed by many other Republicans.
13128	APW_ENG_20081218.0897.LDC2009T13	"It's in the spectrum of options and there are a lot of options," Perino said.
13129	APW_ENG_20081218.0897.LDC2009T13	She said one of the factors delaying an announcement on an auto rescue plan is the continuing discussion between the administration and the various sides that would have to sign on to a managed bankruptcy, such as labor unions and equity holders in addition to the companies themselves.
13130	APW_ENG_20081218.0897.LDC2009T13	"In any scenario that comes forward after this decision-making process, all those stakeholders are going to have to make tough decisions," she said.
13131	APW_ENG_20081218.0897.LDC2009T13	The presidential spokeswoman would not put a timetable on when an announcement would come, and suggested it might not happen this week.
13132	APW_ENG_20081218.0897.LDC2009T13	But something must be done, she said.
13133	APW_ENG_20081218.0897.LDC2009T13	"If you thought that our economy today could handle the collapse of the American auto industry, then you might come to the conclusion that doing nothing was an option," Perino said.
13134	APW_ENG_20081218.0897.LDC2009T13	"We're going to do something."

13137	APW_ENG_20081218.1231.LDC2009T13	NEW YORK 2008-12-18 20:40:41 UTC
13138	APW_ENG_20081218.1231.LDC2009T13	Investors poured more money into Treasurys on Thursday, sending yields to record lows again even as the Treasury Department said it would sell record amounts of notes next week.
13139	APW_ENG_20081218.1231.LDC2009T13	Usually, a boost in supply would dampen prices and raise yields.
13140	APW_ENG_20081218.1231.LDC2009T13	However, after the Federal Reserve said Tuesday that it was considering buying long-term government debt, investors are not yet worried about a drop-off in demand.
13141	APW_ENG_20081218.1231.LDC2009T13	The 10-year Treasury note's yield sank as low as 2.04 percent, and the 30-year bond's yield dropped as low as 2.52 percent.
13142	APW_ENG_20081218.1231.LDC2009T13	Low yields are good for borrowers with rates tied to Treasurys, but bad for investors in funds that are swarming to Treasury issues for safety.
13143	APW_ENG_20081218.1231.LDC2009T13	"Yields are just at jaw-dropping levels," said Kim Rupert, managing director of global fixed income analysis at Action Economics.
13144	APW_ENG_20081218.1231.LDC2009T13	"Obviously at some point it comes to an end, but it's not clear where ... If this market has told us anything, it's don't underestimate the powerful demand for Treasurys."
13145	APW_ENG_20081218.1231.LDC2009T13	The Treasury said it would auction $38 billion in two-year notes and $28 in five-year notes.
13146	APW_ENG_20081218.1231.LDC2009T13	Both those figures were the highest amounts on record.
13147	APW_ENG_20081218.1231.LDC2009T13	It's possible that if enough supply comes into the market, it will keep yields low enough for a long enough period of time that investors will look for riskier assets offering higher returns.
13148	APW_ENG_20081218.1231.LDC2009T13	That's happening a bit already with mortgage-backed securities, the rates of which are falling and helping bring down mortgage rates for homeowners.
13149	APW_ENG_20081218.1231.LDC2009T13	Mortgage giant Freddie Mac on Thursday reported that rates had fallen to the lowest level on records dating back to 1971.
13150	APW_ENG_20081218.1231.LDC2009T13	Average rates on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages sank to 5.19 percent from the year's previous low of 5.47 percent set last week.
13151	APW_ENG_20081218.1231.LDC2009T13	Demand for corporate bonds has also started to trickle back since the Fed slashed its target rate to nearly zero on Tuesday, but the recovery process is expected to be extremely slow.

13155	APW_ENG_20081218.1231.LDC2009T13	The two-year Treasury note rose 4/32 to 101 2/32, and its yield fell to 0.70 percent from 0.75 percent late Wednesday.
13156	APW_ENG_20081218.1231.LDC2009T13	The 10-year note rose 1 5/32 to 114 28/32, and its yield fell to 2.08 percent from 2.21 percent.

13159	APW_ENG_20081218.1231.LDC2009T13	Economic data released Thursday were not as grim as many anticipated, but still evinced a very weak climate.
13160	APW_ENG_20081218.1231.LDC2009T13	The Labor Department reported that new applications for jobless benefits fell to a seasonally adjusted 554,000 last week -- lower than expected -- from an upwardly revised figure of 575,000 the previous week.

13167	APW_ENG_20081220.0593.LDC2009T13	In the nonprofit legal center Steven Schwartz runs from a converted furniture store in Massachussets, the e-mail was very good news: By week's end, a check for $243,000 would be on its way.
13168	APW_ENG_20081220.0593.LDC2009T13	The money couldn't come soon enough.
13169	APW_ENG_20081220.0593.LDC2009T13	The sharp downturn in the economy had put Schwartz's group -- working to improve treatment of teen offenders with mental illnesses -- under very tight budget pressure.
13170	APW_ENG_20081220.0593.LDC2009T13	At least the check was a promise he could count on.
13171	APW_ENG_20081220.0593.LDC2009T13	By that Thursday, though, events were unfolding 160 miles (258 kilometers) away that would upend those assumptions and assurances.
13172	APW_ENG_20081220.0593.LDC2009T13	In a federal courtroom in lower Manhattan, a Wall Street wizard stood before a judge, charged with running a $50 billion fraud that targeted scores of wealthy and powerful investors.
13173	APW_ENG_20081220.0593.LDC2009T13	The name of the accused, Bernard L. Madoff, meant nothing to Schwartz and why should it?
13174	APW_ENG_20081220.0593.LDC2009T13	He'd never heard of the money manager with the beachfront mansion and the 55-foot (17-meter) yacht.
13175	APW_ENG_20081220.0593.LDC2009T13	They'd certainly never met.
13176	APW_ENG_20081220.0593.LDC2009T13	There was no reason to think they had anything in common.
13177	APW_ENG_20081220.0593.LDC2009T13	Except, it turned out, the money.
13178	APW_ENG_20081220.0593.LDC2009T13	In the days since Madoff's Dec. 11 arrest, the tale has repeatedly been told of wealthy victims who, perhaps naively, invested their trust in a man who promised financial miracles.
13179	APW_ENG_20081220.0593.LDC2009T13	But the scale of the Madoff scandal can just as well be measured in its still-widening ripples, reaching far-flung people and causes -- from a group helping just-released inmates find jobs in Rhode Island to another working to provide fresh food in poor neighborhoods in Detroit and Oakland, California.

13183	APW_ENG_20081220.0593.LDC2009T13	In the hotly competitive but tight-knit world of New York commercial real estate, Levy worked across more than seven decades brokering leases in midtown's towers.
13184	APW_ENG_20081220.0593.LDC2009T13	When he died in 2005 at 93, he was hailed as an elder statesman of the trade whose zest for the deal was matched by his generosity with both friendship and money.
13185	APW_ENG_20081220.0593.LDC2009T13	"Your spirit and love of life have touched and changed all who knew you," one friend of 40 years wrote in a paid death notice for Levy that ran in The New York Times.
13186	APW_ENG_20081220.0593.LDC2009T13	"You taught me so much.
13187	APW_ENG_20081220.0593.LDC2009T13	I'll cherish our relationship forever."
13188	APW_ENG_20081220.0593.LDC2009T13	The friend was Bernard Madoff.
13189	APW_ENG_20081220.0593.LDC2009T13	The real estate broker and the money manager were separated by 26 years, but they and their families had formed a friendship reinforced by shared interests, social circles -- and trust.
13190	APW_ENG_20081220.0593.LDC2009T13	Levy and Madoff were active in some of the same organizations, like New York's Yeshiva University.
13191	APW_ENG_20081220.0593.LDC2009T13	They donated their money to many of the same causes -- groups including the Lincoln Center Theater and Gift of Life, a South Florida charity that tries to save Jewish leukemia victims by matching them with bone marrow donors.
13192	APW_ENG_20081220.0593.LDC2009T13	In the summer, both families headed to the Hamptons.
13193	APW_ENG_20081220.0593.LDC2009T13	When Norman F. Levy died, he was staying at his daughter's house fronting the Atlantic, just a few sprawling lots away from the mansion owned by the Madoffs.
13194	APW_ENG_20081220.0593.LDC2009T13	For more than 30 years, the Levys also entrusted their personal investments to Madoff.
13195	APW_ENG_20081220.0593.LDC2009T13	When they chartered the Betty and Norman F. Levy Foundation -- which reported assets last year of $244.4 million -- as the vehicle for their charitable giving, they again put their trust in their longtime friend.

13200	APW_ENG_20081220.0593.LDC2009T13	When Norman Levy died, they took the helm of the family philanthropy, leaving the funds invested with Madoff, whose offices were housed in the same Third Avenue tower as the foundation.
13201	APW_ENG_20081220.0593.LDC2009T13	The Levy Foundation continued donations to longtime favorite charities.
13202	APW_ENG_20081220.0593.LDC2009T13	But its biggest checks went to a new set of organizations created by Norman Levy's children to champion causes they embraced.
13203	APW_ENG_20081220.0593.LDC2009T13	In 2000, Jeanne set up the JEHT Foundation, whose name is an acronym for Justice, Equality, Human dignity and Tolerance -- originally to work on criminal justice reform, an area where funds are scarce.
13204	APW_ENG_20081220.0593.LDC2009T13	Last year, the Levy family financed JEHT to the tune of $29.9 million.
13205	APW_ENG_20081220.0593.LDC2009T13	Levy Church, and her husband, Kenneth, "felt that they were fortunate in their life to have this remarkable amount of money and they felt they wanted to use it for less fortunate people," said Robert Crane, president of the JEHT Foundation.
13206	APW_ENG_20081220.0593.LDC2009T13	Francis Levy co-founded the Philoctetes Center, a group dedicated to fostering discussions of everything from literature to economics.
13207	APW_ENG_20081220.0593.LDC2009T13	In 2007, the Levy Foundation financed Philoctetes with $950,000.
13208	APW_ENG_20081220.0593.LDC2009T13	Last year, Francis Levy invited his family's longtime friend, Madoff, to appear on a panel at the center to talk about the workings of Wall Street.
13209	APW_ENG_20081220.0593.LDC2009T13	More recently, the Levy Churches formed another group, the Fair Food Foundation, based in Ann Arbor, Mich., which set out to find ways to get fresher, healthy food to residents of poor city neighborhoods starting with Detroit and Oakland, California.
13210	APW_ENG_20081220.0593.LDC2009T13	None of the Levys' foundations are well-known to the general public.
13211	APW_ENG_20081220.0593.LDC2009T13	But they got an enthusiastic reception from groups across the country that were hungry for funding.
13212	APW_ENG_20081220.0593.LDC2009T13	At the walk-in counseling office run by Rhode Island Family Life Center in a poor neighborhood in South Providence, a JEHT grant of $500,000 over two years paid staffers who help inmates just released from prison find housing and jobs.
13213	APW_ENG_20081220.0593.LDC2009T13	In 2007, the group provided services to 1,000 people.
13214	APW_ENG_20081220.0593.LDC2009T13	A New Orleans group, Advocates for Environmental Human Rights, used a grant from JEHT to pursue a lawsuit charging "environmental racism" in the predominantly black Louisiana town of Mossville, where the soil and water are polluted by 14 surrounding factories.
13215	APW_ENG_20081220.0593.LDC2009T13	And in Schwartz's program in Massachusetts, JEHT offered a three- year grant for work in Connecticut, Texas, Alabama and elsewhere to get states to reconsider treatment of teen offenders with mental health problems, encouraging them to send some home with therapy or provide it in detention centers.
13216	APW_ENG_20081220.0593.LDC2009T13	The JEHT grant accounted for 26 percent of the Center for Public Representation's annual budget.
13217	APW_ENG_20081220.0593.LDC2009T13	Its importance became even more clear this fall when a state tax on real estate transactions that provides nearly as much of the group's funding dropped sharply with the collapse of the housing market, Schwartz said.
13218	APW_ENG_20081220.0593.LDC2009T13	Still, Schwartz's staff of 11 was so certain of JEHT's backing that they moved ahead with new projects, spending about $25,000 in advance.
13219	APW_ENG_20081220.0593.LDC2009T13	"We just trusted that we would get the money, and so rather than suspend the work until the check was in hand ... we do the work and expected the check will follow," Schwartz said.

13228	APW_ENG_20081220.0593.LDC2009T13	On Monday morning Crane sent an e-mail to people at nearly 150 groups around the country that count on his foundation for $25 to $30 million in funding each year.

13230	APW_ENG_20081220.0593.LDC2009T13	Francis Levy's group, the Philoctetes Center, also announced it could not continue without a cash infusion.
13231	APW_ENG_20081220.0593.LDC2009T13	The Fair Food Foundation, announced it would close, delivering what its president, Oran Hesterman called "a stinging blow" to activists working to improve nutrition in poor neighborhoods.
13232	APW_ENG_20081220.0593.LDC2009T13	Leaders of some of the groups funded by the foundations said they had not even been aware that their money came from the Levy family.
13233	APW_ENG_20081220.0593.LDC2009T13	Nor had they ever heard of Madoff.
13234	APW_ENG_20081220.0593.LDC2009T13	Some groups, like the Rhode Island center that finds jobs and housing for former inmates, were relatively lucky.
13235	APW_ENG_20081220.0593.LDC2009T13	JEHT provides a third of its annual budget, but the check for 2009 had already been cashed.
13236	APW_ENG_20081220.0593.LDC2009T13	The impact will become clear next year when the group tries to replace that money in an economy that has made fundraising increasingly difficult, Executive Director Sol Rodriguez said.
13237	APW_ENG_20081220.0593.LDC2009T13	For others, the impact was immediate.
13238	APW_ENG_20081220.0593.LDC2009T13	Between the JEHT closure and the drop in tax revenues, Schwartz's group has seen 48 percent of its budget vanish.

13244	APW_ENG_20081220.0593.LDC2009T13	It's a strange paradox, Schwartz and others in his situation say.
13245	APW_ENG_20081220.0593.LDC2009T13	All the attention swirling around Madoff has been about his wealthy lifestyle and the ultra-rich investors in places like Palm Beach and Hollywood and New York who lost their shirts.
13246	APW_ENG_20081220.0593.LDC2009T13	But few seem to understand the repercussions.
13247	APW_ENG_20081220.0593.LDC2009T13	"It's very ironic that the very wealthiest in the country can have such a severe impact on kids on the low end of the totem pole," said Mark Steward, whose Missouri Youth Services Institute has relied on funding from the Levy family to help improve juvenile detention centers in Santa Clara County, California, Washington, D.C. and elsewhere.
13248	APW_ENG_20081220.0593.LDC2009T13	If only Madoff knew, Steward mused -- "Or maybe he does know."

13252	APW_ENG_20081222.0177.LDC2009T13	Ireland will invest at least euro5.5 billion ($7.7 billion) in three Irish banks to boost their cash reserves, investor confidence and the banks' ability to lend, the government announced.
13253	APW_ENG_20081222.0177.LDC2009T13	Finance Minister Brian Lenihan said Sunday night that the boards of the three banks -- Allied Irish, Bank of Ireland and Anglo- Irish -- would issue preference shares paying fixed dividends to the government in exchange for the aid.
13254	APW_ENG_20081222.0177.LDC2009T13	The plan still requires shareholder approval at emergency meetings expected next month.
13255	APW_ENG_20081222.0177.LDC2009T13	The plan is designed to boost each bank's cash reserves and restore international confidence in Ireland's banking sector, which faces rising loan defaults and the prospect of worse to come from a deepening recession.
13256	APW_ENG_20081222.0177.LDC2009T13	Allied Irish Banks PLC, Ireland's biggest bank, and No. 2 Bank of Ireland both are in line to receive euro2 billion.
13257	APW_ENG_20081222.0177.LDC2009T13	In return the government will receive preference shares paying a fixed 8 percent dividend -- or euro160 million a year from each bank -- as well as 25 percent of voting rights in the bank's board of directors.
13258	APW_ENG_20081222.0177.LDC2009T13	Anglo-Irish Bank Corp., a specialist lender heavily exposed to the collapse of Ireland's property and construction markets, would fall under government control.
13259	APW_ENG_20081222.0177.LDC2009T13	The government has agreed to pay euro1.5 billion for preference shares in Anglo-Irish that will pay a 10 percent fixed dividend, or euro150 million annually.
13260	APW_ENG_20081222.0177.LDC2009T13	The government would receive 75 percent of voting rights if shareholders approve the plan.
13261	APW_ENG_20081222.0177.LDC2009T13	Lenihan said all three banks could pay back the aid at face value within the next five years, or 125 percent of its value after five years.
13262	APW_ENG_20081222.0177.LDC2009T13	He also said the government was ready to provide more aid if the banks' share values and ability to lend didn't markedly improve.
13263	APW_ENG_20081222.0177.LDC2009T13	The finance chief said the government was willing to underwrite the issuing of euro1 billion each in new Allied Irish and Bank of Ireland shares -- which means the government would purchase any new shares that existing shareholders decline to buy.
13264	APW_ENG_20081222.0177.LDC2009T13	Bank of Ireland said it was interested in the government's underwriting offer.
13265	APW_ENG_20081222.0177.LDC2009T13	Allied Irish said it remained hopeful of raising sufficient funds from selling its own assets, particularly its minority stake in M&amp

13267	APW_ENG_20081222.0177.LDC2009T13	Lenihan said the government's representatives on the boards of all three banks would ensure that the banks increase mortgage lending by 30 percent and loans to small business by 10 percent.
13268	APW_ENG_20081222.0177.LDC2009T13	The banks also would be expected to back off defaulting mortgage- holders, giving them a six-month grace period.
13269	APW_ENG_20081222.0177.LDC2009T13	Ireland's long-booming economy has gone swiftly into reverse over the past year.

13273	CNA_ENG_20070101.0017.LDC2009T13	The number of tourists to the Alishan Forest Park year almost hit 1 million last year, officials from the Forestry Bureau's Chiayi office reported Monday.
13274	CNA_ENG_20070101.0017.LDC2009T13	The officials said that as of midnight Sunday, the number of tourists visiting the park reached more than 994,000, a record since the park first opened in 1982.
13275	CNA_ENG_20070101.0017.LDC2009T13	They said that in the year following the opening of the park, 950,000 people visited the park.
13276	CNA_ENG_20070101.0017.LDC2009T13	The number had been maintained at between 500,000 and 600,000 every year since then.
13277	CNA_ENG_20070101.0017.LDC2009T13	After a devastating earthquake that hit Taiwan Sept. 21, 1999, the number of visits plunged significantly to 360,000.
13278	CNA_ENG_20070101.0017.LDC2009T13	The number of tourists then increased gradually, the officials said, increasing from 699,000 in 2003 to 724,000 in 2005.

13281	CNA_ENG_20070101.0030.LDC2009T13	Taipei, Jan. 1 (CNA) 01/01/07 20:26:09 (By Han Nai-kuo)
13282	CNA_ENG_20070101.0030.LDC2009T13	Police will no longer adopt a high profile when enforcing traffic regulations in 2007, but will act furtively to weed out dangerous and reckless drivers in an attempt to reduce fatalities on Taiwan's public roads, Minister of the Interior Lee Yi-yang said Monday.
13283	CNA_ENG_20070101.0030.LDC2009T13	At a ceremony to examine traffic police equipment, Lee defended the change in tactic, saying there is nothing unlawful about the decision because no traffic regulations in Taiwan or anywhere else in the world stipulate that teams of traffic police cannot lurk furtively anywhere along a road to catch bad drivers.
13284	CNA_ENG_20070101.0030.LDC2009T13	Citing statistics, Lee said that Taiwan recorded a death toll of 4,322 on public roads in 2002.
13285	CNA_ENG_20070101.0030.LDC2009T13	However, after the National Police Agency bowed to public pressure in July 2003 to require police to enforce traffic regulations in an open and conspicuous manner, the death toll soared to 4,735 in 2005 and broke the 5,000 mark in 2006.
13286	CNA_ENG_20070101.0030.LDC2009T13	Taiwan's road fatalities in 2006 were tantamount to a rate of 21.8 deaths per 100,000 people, or three times as high as Japan's seven deaths per 100,000 people, he added.
13287	CNA_ENG_20070101.0030.LDC2009T13	Lee urged car drivers and motorcyclists to observe traffic rules at all times, instead of being law-abiding citizens only when they know they are being watched by traffic police.
13288	CNA_ENG_20070101.0030.LDC2009T13	According to the EPA, its plan to crack down on irresponsible drivers will deal harshly with serious traffic violations, including drunken driving, running red lights, exceeding the legal speed limit by 40 km, driving on the shoulder of the road, large vehicles not using the right lane for slower traffic, and weaving and swerving through traffic.
13289	CNA_ENG_20070101.0030.LDC2009T13	The plan will allow the use of hidden cameras at strategic locations to photograph violations and let unmarked police vehicles mix into traffic to find those bad drivers.

13294	CNA_ENG_20070203.0013.LDC2009T13	Judging from the statistics, there is a trend that more and more East European countries are shifting their purchase sources from Western Europe to more competitive Asian countries, the official added.
13295	CNA_ENG_20070203.0013.LDC2009T13	TAITRA is scheduled to hold three trade seminars in Poland, Ukraine and Russia, respectively, from May 15-27.

13311	CNA_ENG_20070605.0036.LDC2009T13	A majority of respondents to a public opinion poll complained about lingering economic doldrums, declining income, inflating consumer prices and the widening wealth gap, pollsters said Tuesday.
13312	CNA_ENG_20070605.0036.LDC2009T13	According to the results of the survey conducted by the China Times, a Taipei- based Chinese-language daily, 69 percent of the respondents said they feel the domestic economy is in bad shape, while 21 percent said the economy is "so-so," and only 4 percent gave the economy a positive review, with 6 percent refusing to answer the question.
13313	CNA_ENG_20070605.0036.LDC2009T13	The telephone poll was conducted from May 30-June 1 among randomly chosen adults, with 829 valid samples collected and a margin of error of 3.5 percent recorded.
13314	CNA_ENG_20070605.0036.LDC2009T13	Compared with the findings of a similar survey conducted by the newspaper in mid-February, the ratio of those who perceived the economy as "sluggish" rose 21 percent while the percentage of those who felt the economy was "in good shape or robust" decreased 13 percent.
13315	CNA_ENG_20070605.0036.LDC2009T13	The survey findings marked a sharp contrast to official growth figures.
13316	CNA_ENG_20070605.0036.LDC2009T13	According to statistics released by the government, the country's gross domestic product (GDP) posted a 4.15 percent gain year-on-year in the first quarter of this year.
13317	CNA_ENG_20070605.0036.LDC2009T13	Superficially, Taiwan's economy has continued to grow, but the poll found that few respondents are upbeat about their economic well-being.

13320	CNA_ENG_20070605.0036.LDC2009T13	while only 9 percent said they think their income is likely to increase.
13321	CNA_ENG_20070605.0036.LDC2009T13	While the government has often touted a steady decline in the unemployment rate, but fear of job losses has continued to haunt many wage earners.
13322	CNA_ENG_20070605.0036.LDC2009T13	The survey results show that 54 percent of the respondents said they are afraid of losing their jobs, compared to 43 percent who said they have no such worries.
13323	CNA_ENG_20070605.0036.LDC2009T13	Asked about their views on the current consumer price levels, 56 percent said they can hardly endure the present upward spiral
13324	CNA_ENG_20070605.0036.LDC2009T13	32 percent said they perceive the price hikes to be moderate
13325	CNA_ENG_20070605.0036.LDC2009T13	7 percent said they feel the price levels have remained almost unchanged
13326	CNA_ENG_20070605.0036.LDC2009T13	and only a tiny number of respondents said they feel consumer prices are falling.
13327	CNA_ENG_20070605.0036.LDC2009T13	The increasing wealth gap between rich and poor is now widely perceived, according to the poll.
13328	CNA_ENG_20070605.0036.LDC2009T13	Up to 88 percent of those surveyed said they think the rich-poor gap has been widening seriously while only 5 percent said the problem is not very serious.
13329	CNA_ENG_20070605.0036.LDC2009T13	Asked about Taiwan's current socio-economic structure, 56 percent perceived themselves as middle class in the social hierarchy, compared to 1 percent who perceive themselves as upper class and 35 percent who said they are at the bottom of society.
13330	CNA_ENG_20070605.0036.LDC2009T13	Meanwhile, 81 percent said they agree with the comment that Taiwan's middle class has disappeared, with wealth getting more concentrated among fewer people, while the poor are getting poorer.
13331	CNA_ENG_20070605.0036.LDC2009T13	However, 11 percent said they disagree with the observation.
13332	CNA_ENG_20070605.0036.LDC2009T13	Generally speaking, 46 percent said their current livelihoods are roughly same as the previous year

13334	CNA_ENG_20070605.0036.LDC2009T13	As for major obstacles to Taiwan's economic development, 42 percent said "government inaction due to partisan strife" is the most serious problem hindering economic development
13335	CNA_ENG_20070605.0036.LDC2009T13	32 percent said official corruption and incompetence is to blame
13336	CNA_ENG_20070605.0036.LDC2009T13	7 percent attributed the current woes to international competition
13337	CNA_ENG_20070605.0036.LDC2009T13	and 6 percent said cross-Taiwan Strait issues are the main hindrance.
13338	CNA_ENG_20070605.0036.LDC2009T13	Economists also attributed the gap between bright economic growth figures and bleak popular perception to a combination of factors, including the country's excessive reliance on exports for economic growth, relocation of a number of manufacturing industries to China and other areas to lower production costs, flagging private consumption and investment, zero growth in salaries for a large number of wage earners
13339	CNA_ENG_20070605.0036.LDC2009T13	and most of the economic growth benefits enjoyed by capitalists and corporate owners.

13357	CNA_ENG_20070817.0007.LDC2009T13	Taiwan is bracing for the largest storm to hit so far this year, as Typhoon Sepat, for which the Central Weather Bureau (CWB) issued a land warning at 8: 30 p.m. Thursday, continues to approach Taiwan Friday.
13358	CNA_ENG_20070817.0007.LDC2009T13	CWB meteorologists forecast that Sepat will begin to pound Taiwan with strong winds and torrential rain from Friday afternoon and that its onslaught is expected to cover the entire island with a radius of 250 km.
13359	CNA_ENG_20070817.0007.LDC2009T13	The typhoon was centered 390 km southeast of Taitung in eastern Taiwan as of 9 a.m., moving northwesterly at 18-21 kph toward the island and packing maximum sustained winds of 184 kph.

13363	CNA_ENG_20071201.0011.LDC2009T13	Taipei, Dec. 1 (CNA) 12/01/07 13:54:58 (By Sofia Wu)
13364	CNA_ENG_20071201.0011.LDC2009T13	The American Chamber of Commerce in Taipei (AmCham) has published a special report titled Vision 2020 on Taiwan's future to serve as its recommendations for the presidential candidates of the country's two largest political parities.
13365	CNA_ENG_20071201.0011.LDC2009T13	AmCham said in a news release issued Friday that Taiwan has the potential to enjoy immense business opportunities over the coming decade or more in high-tech industries, financial services and other areas of the economy.
13366	CNA_ENG_20071201.0011.LDC2009T13	Nevertheless, it pointed out that achieving such success will depend on numerous factors, particularly how well Taiwan overcomes its current reluctance to tap fully into the mega- growth taking place in China's economy.
13367	CNA_ENG_20071201.0011.LDC2009T13	"It will also be necessary to boost competitiveness through such steps as revamping tax policy, restructuring the financial system, carrying out educational reform, creating a more transparent, consistent and even-handed regulatory regime, and liberalizing rules on work permits for foreign and mainland Chinese professionals," said the AmCham press release.
13368	CNA_ENG_20071201.0011.LDC2009T13	Even more fundamentally, the news release went on, Taiwan will need to maintain stable cross-Taiwan Strait relations, adopt a more outward-looking and internationalist mindset, strengthen its democratic institutions and build a more collaborative domestic political environment.
13369	CNA_ENG_20071201.0011.LDC2009T13	These are the major conclusions in Vision 2020, a special issue of Taiwan Business TOPICS that was published this week, the news release said.
13370	CNA_ENG_20071201.0011.LDC2009T13	TOPICS is a monthly magazine published by AmCham.
13371	CNA_ENG_20071201.0011.LDC2009T13	According to the AmCham news release, Vision 2020 contains 14 articles by prominent Taiwanese and international commentators, attempting to look beyond short-term issues to identify what Taiwan should wish to be like in the year 2020 and what will be required to attain this.
13372	CNA_ENG_20071201.0011.LDC2009T13	In an accompanying editorial in the issue of Taiwan Business TOPICS, AmCham Taipei states that the necessary progress can only be attained through vigorous, clear-minded and enlightened leadership.
13373	CNA_ENG_20071201.0011.LDC2009T13	"It is therefore particularly timely that Vision 2020 is being published in the midst of the campaign for the presidential election of next March," notes the editorial.
13374	CNA_ENG_20071201.0011.LDC2009T13	The editorial further recommends that the presidential and vice presidential nominees and their aides regard the special section as a useful source of reference as they put together the policy objectives that will define their candidacies.
13375	CNA_ENG_20071201.0011.LDC2009T13	"After the election, the winning team might well give these papers a rereading as a reminder of what needs to be tackled during their term in office to help set the stage for a politically stable, economically flourishing and socially just Taiwan in 2020," it adds.
13376	CNA_ENG_20071201.0011.LDC2009T13	Following is a list of the 14 contributors and their major themes:

13424	CNA_ENG_20080315.0014.LDC2009T13	Taipei, March 15 (CNA) 03/15/08 14:36:15 (By Sofia Wu)
13425	CNA_ENG_20080315.0014.LDC2009T13	President Chen Shui-bian touted Friday his insistence on Taiwan's separate identity, the consolidation and deepening of Taiwan's young democracy, and the upholding of freedom of the press as his political legacies.
13426	CNA_ENG_20080315.0014.LDC2009T13	"I feel I have done right in standing firm on carving out a distinct Taiwanese identity separate from China and working hard to consolidate and deepen our young democracy," said a confident Chen in an interview with cable television station TVBS.
13427	CNA_ENG_20080315.0014.LDC2009T13	Reviewing his eight years in office, Chen said he also feels he has not let the country down in maintaining peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait and in promoting closer cross-strait exchanges.
13428	CNA_ENG_20080315.0014.LDC2009T13	"Despite occasional tension in cross-strait relations over the past years, none of them have ever deteriorated into a conflict or crisis.
13429	CNA_ENG_20080315.0014.LDC2009T13	The situation has consistently been brought under control and cross-strait relations have generally remained stable and peaceful, as well as growing ever-closer economically," he said.
13430	CNA_ENG_20080315.0014.LDC2009T13	Asked about how a national leader should react to a national crisis, Chen said that although things may differ in nature and require different response strategies, fundamental beliefs and core values should be upheld without change.
13431	CNA_ENG_20080315.0014.LDC2009T13	"Without fundamental convictions, a national leader will be prone to wavering," he said.
13432	CNA_ENG_20080315.0014.LDC2009T13	Moreover, Chen went on, resilience is very important.
13433	CNA_ENG_20080315.0014.LDC2009T13	"A national leader must have the capacity to cope with stress, pressure and adversity and should not flip-flop on key policy issues under pressure from interest groups or the media," he added.
13434	CNA_ENG_20080315.0014.LDC2009T13	Noting that a national leader must take a stance conducive to national interests and the well-being of the people, Chen said Taiwan's president must insist on taking the correct path in the face of pressure from China and the international community, referring to his adamant attitude toward the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) -initiated referendum on seeking U.N. membership under the name of Taiwan, despite opposition from the United States, Europe and China.
13435	CNA_ENG_20080315.0014.LDC2009T13	The referendum is set to take place alongside the March 22 presidential election.
13436	CNA_ENG_20080315.0014.LDC2009T13	As to whether he felt despondent about the extremely low voter turnout for the two referendums held alongside the Jan. 12 legislative elections, Chen replied: "Not at all."
13437	CNA_ENG_20080315.0014.LDC2009T13	"Even though the referendums failed to pass the legal thresholds required for them to take effect, I don't think they were flops," Chen argued.
13438	CNA_ENG_20080315.0014.LDC2009T13	One of the referendums was initiated by the DPP and asked voters whether the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) should be required to return to the national coffers its ill-gotten party assets.
13439	CNA_ENG_20080315.0014.LDC2009T13	"The number of `yes' ballots cast for the `KMT assets' referendum was even higher than the total ballots the DPP garnered in the legislative elections," Chen said.
13440	CNA_ENG_20080315.0014.LDC2009T13	As a matter of fact, he went on, the gap between voter turnout for the legislative elections and the "KMT assets" referendum -- 58.5 percent to 26 percent -- was slightly lower than the difference between the 2004 presidential election and the two defensive referendums held alongside -- 80 percent to 45 percent.
13441	CNA_ENG_20080315.0014.LDC2009T13	In the 2004 presidential poll, Chen took 6.47 million ballots, while the number of ballots cast in each of the two defensive referendums held exceeded 7 million.
13442	CNA_ENG_20080315.0014.LDC2009T13	"None of the four national referendums held in the past was successful, mainly because of the unreasonably high legal threshold set forth by our existing Referendum Act, " Chen said, adding that he looks forward to seeing the law amended to lower the threshold.
13443	CNA_ENG_20080315.0014.LDC2009T13	Referring to his other legacies, Chen said he is gratified with the implementation of an alternative minimum tax system and a portable pension system, as well as the legislation of a national pension act that will take effect in October.
13444	CNA_ENG_20080315.0014.LDC2009T13	"All these moves are no easy task and we have made them at a price far lower than that endured by many other countries, " Chen said, adding that the enactment of these new systems have delivered on his campaign promises.
13445	CNA_ENG_20080315.0014.LDC2009T13	Chen refrained from commenting in detail on a recent incident involving four KMT lawmakers who gatecrashed DPP presidential candidate Frank Hsieh's campaign headquarters in an attempt to investigate whether Hsieh was unlawfully using the building, which belongs to the state-controlled First Financial Holding Co., as his campaign office.
13446	CNA_ENG_20080315.0014.LDC2009T13	"We should look at the incident from a macro-perspective, rather than just taking it as an isolated case.
13447	CNA_ENG_20080315.0014.LDC2009T13	We should pay more heed to the impact of the expanding legislative power, which has led to many unprecedented developments and phenomena over the past years, including a six-month delay in legislative passage of the government budgets and unconstitutional provisions included in statutes regarding the National Communications Commission and the 319 Truth Commission," Chen said.
13448	CNA_ENG_20080315.0014.LDC2009T13	On a KMT legislative caucus plan to enact a statute governing presidential power transition that will freeze the outgoing president's personnel and policy-making rights following every presidential election, Chen said such stipulations will violate constitutional provisions, as the president's powers and duties are prescribed in the Constitution, which cannot be overridden by an act passed by the lawmaking body.
13449	CNA_ENG_20080315.0014.LDC2009T13	Meanwhile, Chen revealed that he plans to come up with a new nomination list for Control Yuan seats for confirmation by the legislature, in which the KMT controls a more-than two-thirds majority.
13450	CNA_ENG_20080315.0014.LDC2009T13	The country's top government watchdog body has remained empty since the term of previous Control Yuan members expired in January 2005 as the opposition-controlled legislature refused to review the Chen-proposed list.
13451	CNA_ENG_20080315.0014.LDC2009T13	"The roster will comprise elite members from relevant professional fields, " Chen said, adding that he hopes the legislature will not boycott his nomination this time around.
13452	CNA_ENG_20080315.0014.LDC2009T13	With just slightly more than two months to go before his eight- year tenure expires, Chen said he keenly hopes that political bickering and antagonism between the KMT-led "pan-blue alliance" and the DPP-led "pan-green camp" can come to an end along with his retirement May 20.
13453	CNA_ENG_20080315.0014.LDC2009T13	In another interview with the London-based Financial Times earlier in the week, Chen also touted his administration's achievements in overseeing a shift in sentiment for "Taiwanese identity" that appears irreversible.
13454	CNA_ENG_20080315.0014.LDC2009T13	"According to opinion polls, more than 70 percent of Taiwan's citizens now see themselves as Taiwanese rather than Chinese, up from about 30 percent before the DPP took power, " Chen told the Financial Times.
13455	CNA_ENG_20080315.0014.LDC2009T13	"If there hadn't been the past eight years of DPP rule and myself as president, Taiwan would have been taken by China after six years, " he said.
13456	CNA_ENG_20080315.0014.LDC2009T13	"That is because of our insistence that Taiwan is a sovereign country, that Taiwan and the PRC are two sovereign countries that do not belong to each other."
13457	CNA_ENG_20080315.0014.LDC2009T13	Calling the rise of a distinct Taiwanese identity "a road of no return, " Chen argued in the interview that while Taiwan and China have moved closer to each other economically, they are moving even further apart politically, thanks to the DPP administration's efforts.

13459	CNA_ENG_20080513.0031.LDC2009T13	Atlanta, May 12 (CNA) 05/13/08 17:21:08 (By Chang Hui-yen and Nick Huang)
13460	CNA_ENG_20080513.0031.LDC2009T13	A Taiwanese aboriginal youth club is slated to perform aboriginal-style dances in two major cities in Texas later this month in an effort to boost Taiwan-U.S. cultural exchanges, an official of the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in Houston, said Monday.
13461	CNA_ENG_20080513.0031.LDC2009T13	Twenty members of the club affiliated with the National Pingtung University of Education, southern Taiwan were selected by Taiwan's Overseas Compatriot Affairs Commission and related government agencies to go on a 22-day performance tour of the central and southern United States, starting May 3, said the official.
13462	CNA_ENG_20080513.0031.LDC2009T13	The club members, sponsored by the Houston Chapter of the Global Alliance for Democracy and Peace and a Taiwan expatriate association in Austin, are scheduled to perform in Houston and Austin on May 23 and May 24, respectively, the official said.
13463	CNA_ENG_20080513.0031.LDC2009T13	Most members of the club are Taiwanese aboriginal students whose mission is to promote Taiwan's aboriginal culture.
13464	CNA_ENG_20080513.0031.LDC2009T13	Their performances are being staged as part of a traditional Taiwanese cultural week event being held around the United States.
13465	CNA_ENG_20080513.0031.LDC2009T13	They will return to Taiwan May 26.

13468	CNA_ENG_20081202.0016.LDC2009T13	Taipei, Dec. 1 (CNA) 12/02/08 10:36:41 (By Lilian Wu)
13469	CNA_ENG_20081202.0016.LDC2009T13	A visit to Taiwan by the Dalai Lama, the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader, would be politically sensitive, and will be left to the country's security agencies to decide, the head of the Cabinet- level Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission said Monday.
13470	CNA_ENG_20081202.0016.LDC2009T13	Minister Kao Su-po said the commission would like to see his visit, but security authorities will make an assessment and come to a decision first.
13471	CNA_ENG_20081202.0016.LDC2009T13	Kao made the remarks after the Dalai Lama, in an interview with the Hong Kong- based weekly Yazhou Zhoukan, said to forge friendly relations with Chinese sisters and brothers and to have exchanges with Buddhist followers, he would like to visit Taiwan again if the chance arises.
13472	CNA_ENG_20081202.0016.LDC2009T13	"The commission attaches great importance to the Dalai Lama's possible visit, given his high profile in the international community," Kao said.
13473	CNA_ENG_20081202.0016.LDC2009T13	But in view of China's concerns wherever he goes, "when will be the appropriate time for the visit and how to arrange his meetings with political heavyweights in Taiwan will be an issue that requires careful thought,' Kao said.
13474	CNA_ENG_20081202.0016.LDC2009T13	The Dalai Lama has visited Taiwan twice, in 1997 and 2001, respectively.

13477	CNA_ENG_20081207.0013.LDC2009T13	Ruling Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Wu Poh-hsiung and his KMT delegation departed for Japan Sunday for a week-long visit aimed at cementing bilateral relations with Tokyo.
13478	CNA_ENG_20081207.0013.LDC2009T13	It marked the first time the KMT chairman has headed to Japan to promote party- to-party exchanges since the KMT came to power in May.
13479	CNA_ENG_20081207.0013.LDC2009T13	During the visit, Wu and his team are expected to meet with leaders of major political parties in Japan and several senior politicians who have assumed important government positions.
13480	CNA_ENG_20081207.0013.LDC2009T13	Noting that President Ma Ying-jeou is attaching great importance to the trip, Wu told the media prior to his departure that the president asked him to pass on some messages to the Japanese side.
13481	CNA_ENG_20081207.0013.LDC2009T13	One of them, Wu said, was that in view of the "special partnership" Taiwan and Japan have maintained, the two sides should spare no effort to further bolster bilateral ties.
13482	CNA_ENG_20081207.0013.LDC2009T13	Taiwan and Japan are very close to each other geographically, share many common interests and have deep historical links, with bilateral trade amounting to US$60 billion and more than 2.5 million visitors traveling between the countries per year, Wu quoted Ma as saying the day before.
13483	CNA_ENG_20081207.0013.LDC2009T13	Wu said that although Taiwan cannot relinquish its sovereignty claim over the disputed Tiaoyutais, a group of islets in the East China Sea claimed by both sides along with China, the president believes that Taiwan and Japan "can put aside the dispute and move toward pursuing their common interests, like fishery cooperation."
13484	CNA_ENG_20081207.0013.LDC2009T13	Wu said Japan may suffer some losses as a transportation hub after direct air and shipping links between Taiwan and China are developed, but that overall Japan will continue to benefit from closer Taiwan-China exchanges.
13485	CNA_ENG_20081207.0013.LDC2009T13	For example, he said, a great number of Taiwanese enterprises have purchased machinery and production equipment from Japan and then exported their products to China, allowing both Taiwan and Japan to prosper from the triangular relationship.
13486	CNA_ENG_20081207.0013.LDC2009T13	"Taiwan and Japan can work together to crack China's vast market," he said.
13487	CNA_ENG_20081207.0013.LDC2009T13	One of the key members of Wu's delegation is former Taiwan representative in Japan Hsu Shui-teh.
13488	CNA_ENG_20081207.0013.LDC2009T13	Wu said Hsu will contribute a lot to the visit because he has maintained close connections with Japanese politicians and has clout in bilateral Taiwan- Japan relations.

13490	LTW_ENG_20070123.0152.LDC2009T13	NEW YORK
13491	LTW_ENG_20070123.0152.LDC2009T13	An ironworker, a paramedic and an attorney who believe their illnesses stem from exposure at Ground Zero plan to attend President Bush's State of the Union address Tuesday night as guests of New York's congressional delegation.
13492	LTW_ENG_20070123.0152.LDC2009T13	They are among those urging Bush to include Sept. 11-related health-are funding when he proposes his 2008 budget.
13493	LTW_ENG_20070123.0152.LDC2009T13	John Sferazo, of Huntington Station, an ironworker who worked at Ground Zero and attributes his reduced breathing capacity and other illnesses to the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks, said he hoped his presence Tuesday night will serve as a reminder of the needs of emergency responders and others.
13494	LTW_ENG_20070123.0152.LDC2009T13	``This tragedy took 3,000 lives and continues to take our lives today,'' Sferazo, president and co-founder of Unsung Heroes Helping Heroes, said at a news conference Monday at the World Trade Center site.
13495	LTW_ENG_20070123.0152.LDC2009T13	The Bush administration has released more than $50 million of $75 million in federal funding to treat first responders through the New York Fire Department and hospitals, including The Mount Sinai Medical Center and Stony Brook University Medical Center.
13496	LTW_ENG_20070123.0152.LDC2009T13	Demand is so high that the money will run out in the next several months, said Dr. Jacqueline Moline, director of Mount Sinai's program, which serves 19,000 patients.
13497	LTW_ENG_20070123.0152.LDC2009T13	A Mount Sinai report found that nearly seven out of every 10 Ground Zero workers suffered lung problems.
13498	LTW_ENG_20070123.0152.LDC2009T13	A U.S. Department of Health and Human Services official said in December that the Bush administration planned to report to Congress on a long-term treatment plan in February, after Bush submits his budget.
13499	LTW_ENG_20070123.0152.LDC2009T13	Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton, D-N.Y., who has submitted legislation pegging the cost for long-term treatment at $1.9 billion, said, ``We want the president and members of Congress to see the faces of those who have suffered because of our negligence in refusing to take care of the people who responded to 9/11,'' she said.
13500	LTW_ENG_20070203.0123.LDC2009T13	Texas Mandates Papilloma Virus Vaccinations
13501	LTW_ENG_20070203.0123.LDC2009T13	HOUSTON
13502	LTW_ENG_20070203.0123.LDC2009T13	Texas on Friday became the first state to require school-age girls be vaccinated against a virus -- typically transmitted through sex -- that has been shown to cause cervical cancer.
13503	LTW_ENG_20070203.0123.LDC2009T13	Gov. Rick Perry signed an executive order mandating that most girls, starting in September 2008, must receive the vaccination against the human papilloma virus, or HPV, prior to entering sixth grade.
13504	LTW_ENG_20070203.0123.LDC2009T13	More than a dozen states have been considering such a move.
13505	LTW_ENG_20070203.0123.LDC2009T13	HPV, which causes genital warts, is the most common sexually transmitted disease in the United States.
13506	LTW_ENG_20070203.0123.LDC2009T13	Several strains of the virus have been linked to cervical cancer, which kills about 3,700 Americans a year, according to the Food and Drug Administration.
13507	LTW_ENG_20070203.0123.LDC2009T13	The federal government approved an HPV vaccine last year, and a government advisory panel has recommended that all girls get shots at age 11 or 12 -- before they begin having sex.
13508	LTW_ENG_20070203.0123.LDC2009T13	But the American College of Pediatricians, a socially conservative group, has opposed any vaccination requirement, calling that a ``precedent-setting action that trespasses on the right of parents to make medical decisions for their children, as well as on the rights of the children to attend school.''
13509	LTW_ENG_20070203.0123.LDC2009T13	By sidestepping the Texas Legislature, Perry -- a conservative Republican -- avoided a showdown with GOP lawmakers and Christian organizations that oppose mandatory HPV vaccinations on the grounds that teaching young people to avoid pre-marital sex is a better solution.
13510	LTW_ENG_20070203.0123.LDC2009T13	Perry defended his decision Friday, arguing that the vaccinations are needed to save lives.
13511	LTW_ENG_20070203.0123.LDC2009T13	He promised that parents who did not want their children vaccinated ``for reasons of conscience'' would be allowed to seek exemptions.
13512	LTW_ENG_20070203.0123.LDC2009T13	The mandate would affect roughly 365,000 girls a year.
13513	LTW_ENG_20070203.0123.LDC2009T13	``The HPV vaccine provides us with an incredible opportunity to effectively target and prevent cervical cancer,'' Perry said in a statement.
13514	LTW_ENG_20070203.0123.LDC2009T13	``Requiring young girls to get vaccinated before they come into contact with HPV is responsible health and fiscal policy.''
13515	LTW_ENG_20070203.0123.LDC2009T13	Public health advocates and liberal activists praised Perry's action, calling it a triumph of common sense over political ideology.
13516	LTW_ENG_20070203.0123.LDC2009T13	``I'm surprised he took this step
13517	LTW_ENG_20070203.0123.LDC2009T13	it breaks with his [political] base,'' said Kathy Miller, president of the Texas Freedom Network, which opposes efforts to mix religion and government policy.
13518	LTW_ENG_20070203.0123.LDC2009T13	But the move drew immediate criticism from conservative groups, which noted that the governor had accepted campaign contributions from Merck &amp
13519	LTW_ENG_20070203.0123.LDC2009T13	Co., the drug company that manufactures the vaccine.
13520	LTW_ENG_20070203.0123.LDC2009T13	``All Merck wanted was a mandate so the insurance companies would have to pay for this.
13521	LTW_ENG_20070203.0123.LDC2009T13	Follow the money,'' said Cathie Adams, president of the Texas Eagle Forum, an organization that promotes socially conservative government policies.
13522	LTW_ENG_20070203.0123.LDC2009T13	``This is telling girls that they can be promiscuous and still be safe,'' she added.
13523	LTW_ENG_20070203.0123.LDC2009T13	Merck has been pushing for laws mandating its Gardasil vaccine in numerous states.
13524	LTW_ENG_20070203.0123.LDC2009T13	It has also launched a television advertising campaign featuring young girls and the slogan ``One less,'' to signify one fewer cancer patient for everyone who takes the vaccine.
13525	LTW_ENG_20070203.0123.LDC2009T13	The New Jersey-based drug company donated $6,000 to Perry's reelection campaign last year, Texas campaign finance records show.
13526	LTW_ENG_20070203.0123.LDC2009T13	One of its top Texas lobbyists, Mike Toomey, is Perry's former chief of staff.
13527	LTW_ENG_20070203.0123.LDC2009T13	Merck was paying Toomey between $25,000 and $50,000 to influence politicians, according to disclosure reports.
13528	LTW_ENG_20070203.0123.LDC2009T13	Perry spokeswoman Krista Moody said the state would boost existing health care programs by $29.4 million a year to help poorer Texans pay for the vaccines, which currently cost more than $300 for a three-shot series.
13529	LTW_ENG_20070214.0089.LDC2009T13	Iraq Facts

13541	LTW_ENG_20070301.0063.LDC2009T13	One grave stands out in the tiny, unfenced village cemetery.
13542	LTW_ENG_20070301.0063.LDC2009T13	Andrzej Zielke's plot is the only one enclosed by an ironwork fence and the only one with a small bench that sits in front of flickering candles and the black, broken heart of a headstone.
13543	LTW_ENG_20070301.0063.LDC2009T13	``He died tragically executing a fighting order in the second change of the Polish military contingent in Iraq,'' reads the inscription, in Polish, on the broken heart, which is etched with the young soldier's face.
13544	LTW_ENG_20070301.0063.LDC2009T13	Zielke's black army beret, soaked recently by a winter rain, sits next to the headstone.
13545	LTW_ENG_20070301.0063.LDC2009T13	About 400 yards down the only road in the village of Prochnik is a farmhouse -- home to a gentle-voiced Polish woman who lost her beloved son in a desert far away and who can't figure out why he was in Iraq, fighting an American war.
13546	LTW_ENG_20070301.0063.LDC2009T13	``I have no idea,'' said Stanislawa Zielke, 49, when asked why she thought Poland had sent its troops -- the third largest Iraq coalition force after the United States and Britain.
13547	LTW_ENG_20070301.0063.LDC2009T13	Many Poles wonder why their government seems so keen to help out the United States in its wars at a time when many other countries are distancing themselves from Iraq and, to a lesser extent, Afghanistan.
13548	LTW_ENG_20070301.0063.LDC2009T13	Al-Qaida did not attack Poland, people say -- though perhaps now it will, they quip.
13549	LTW_ENG_20070301.0063.LDC2009T13	Saddam Hussein, even if he had possessed weapons of mass destruction, was not likely to have put Warsaw near the top of his target list.
13550	LTW_ENG_20070301.0063.LDC2009T13	Polls regularly show at least 70 percent of Poles disapprove of their roughly 1,000-strong contingent being in Iraq.
13551	LTW_ENG_20070301.0063.LDC2009T13	But successive Polish governments have continued a policy of cooperation with the United States on military and intelligence matters that is perhaps unmatched by any country other than Britain.
13552	LTW_ENG_20070301.0063.LDC2009T13	Poland announced late last year that its troops will stay in Iraq through this year and, privately, politicians expect levels to be maintained for years.
13553	LTW_ENG_20070301.0063.LDC2009T13	Poland also is upping its troop levels in Afghanistan from about 100 to more than 1,000 at a time when it is increasingly hard to find NATO volunteers for the ever-more dangerous war there.
13554	LTW_ENG_20070301.0063.LDC2009T13	And, soon there will be up to 500 troops helping keep peace between Israel and Hezbollah in southern Lebanon, a region the U.S. cares very much about since Israel is the United States' most important Middle East ally.
13555	LTW_ENG_20070301.0063.LDC2009T13	Add to the list of Polish favors to the United States the forthcoming negotiations between the two governments over the proposed location of an American missile defense system in Poland that would help protect the United States but not Poland itself and the CIA's widely reported use -- which Poland has officially denied -- of a Polish air base for transporting terrorist suspects to secret interrogation sites.
13556	LTW_ENG_20070301.0063.LDC2009T13	There is a simple calculation that explains this unfashionable support of the U.S. and its military ventures, Polish politicians, Western diplomats and analysts say: Surrounded by historically hostile countries such as Russia and Germany and abandoned in the face of Nazi invasion in 1939 by European allies such as Britain, Poland looks across the Atlantic for bankable friendship.
13557	LTW_ENG_20070301.0063.LDC2009T13	A Russian invasion may seem unlikely now, experts say, but Poles have learned -- through centuries of occupation and vast suffering -- to be extremely wary of their neighbors.
13558	LTW_ENG_20070301.0063.LDC2009T13	``Insurance,'' said Konstanty Gebert, a leading Polish columnist and author, using a single word to explain his country's strong pro-U.S. foreign policy.
13559	LTW_ENG_20070301.0063.LDC2009T13	``This is not a country that feels it's future is assured.
13560	LTW_ENG_20070301.0063.LDC2009T13	Most of that is paranoia -- but not all.''
13561	LTW_ENG_20070301.0063.LDC2009T13	Other than its membership in NATO and the agreement of all member states to help defend any state that is attacked, Poland has no guarantees that its gentleman's agreement with the United States will pay off.
13562	LTW_ENG_20070301.0063.LDC2009T13	``What they get for it is the security umbrella,'' said a Western diplomat in Warsaw who requested anonymity.
13563	LTW_ENG_20070301.0063.LDC2009T13	``It keeps that favorable impression of Poland in Washington high.''
13564	LTW_ENG_20070301.0063.LDC2009T13	There are signs of cooling toward the United States, however, among Polish politicians.
13565	LTW_ENG_20070301.0063.LDC2009T13	Marian Pilka, a leading member of parliament in the ruling Law and Justice Party, told Newsday that when the government sits down to negotiate the missile system with the United States, it will expect something in return.
13566	LTW_ENG_20070301.0063.LDC2009T13	``If this system is to be in Poland, it will make some danger to our country and should be balanced by our own missile defense system,'' he said, referring to U.S.-made Patriot missile defense systems, which could help protect Poland from attacks on its territory.
13567	LTW_ENG_20070301.0063.LDC2009T13	But for those who have suffered from Poland's decision in 2003 to join the war in Iraq, the idea of a theoretical American insurance policy for their country seems irrelevant given the cost.
13568	LTW_ENG_20070301.0063.LDC2009T13	``I'm mad at everybody who had anything to do with the war,'' Stanislawa Zielke said when asked if her son's death was a sacrifice worth making for the sake of Poland's security.

13570	LTW_ENG_20070301.0063.LDC2009T13	As she stood in her kitchen sipping tea and playing with a grandchild -- the daughter of another son -- her husband, Krzysztof, opened the door and heard the conversation.
13571	LTW_ENG_20070301.0063.LDC2009T13	He opened a cupboard, pulled out a wrench and, leaving again, said: ``I don't want to speak because I know I'll cry.''
13572	LTW_ENG_20070301.0063.LDC2009T13	His wife remembered one of her last conversations with Andrzej before he left for Iraq.
13573	LTW_ENG_20070301.0063.LDC2009T13	He told her: ``I just need to catch this Osama guy and I'll be back.''

13575	LTW_ENG_20070301.0063.LDC2009T13	Andrzej, 26, was killed by Iraqi insurgents in June 2004, about a month before his tour of duty was to end.
13576	LTW_ENG_20070301.0063.LDC2009T13	He was hit by a rocket, his body torn into pieces.
13577	LTW_ENG_20070301.0063.LDC2009T13	He left a wife and two sons, one of whom he never got to see.
13578	LTW_ENG_20070301.0063.LDC2009T13	To this day, his mother rushes to the television when news of Iraq appears.
13579	LTW_ENG_20070301.0063.LDC2009T13	She wants to see the country where she believes the parts of her son that weren't scooped up and brought back to Prochnik for burial still lie.
13580	LTW_ENG_20070301.0063.LDC2009T13	A few days after she spoke, Poland lost its 19th soldier in Iraq.

13583	LTW_ENG_20070301.0079.LDC2009T13	In the new comedy ``Wild Hogs,'' Tim Allen, John Travolta, William H. Macy and Martin Lawrence play weekend warrior buddies from Cincinnati who jump on their Harleys and take a road trip to the Pacific in hopes of pepping up their humdrum suburban lives.
13584	LTW_ENG_20070301.0079.LDC2009T13	Although filled with slapstick and more than a few off-color jokes, the movie's underlying theme is how many baby boomers feel that they have compromised their values while losing the idealism of their youth.
13585	LTW_ENG_20070301.0079.LDC2009T13	``We thought we could change the world and, to be fair, we did change the world,'' said Macy.
13586	LTW_ENG_20070301.0079.LDC2009T13	``We stopped the war.
13587	LTW_ENG_20070301.0079.LDC2009T13	We got rid of the president and we changed everything.
13588	LTW_ENG_20070301.0079.LDC2009T13	But life overtook us.
13589	LTW_ENG_20070301.0079.LDC2009T13	And there are hundreds of thousands of Harley riders who are trying to regain that feeling.''
13590	LTW_ENG_20070301.0079.LDC2009T13	``The revolutionary . . . becomes the establishment,'' said Allen.
13591	LTW_ENG_20070301.0079.LDC2009T13	``We would have burned down a stage had it been sponsored by Pepsi Cola.
13592	LTW_ENG_20070301.0079.LDC2009T13	The new generation of musicians, the first thing they do is attach themselves to the corporation.
13593	LTW_ENG_20070301.0079.LDC2009T13	We were anti- establishment, and we became a bigger more powerful establishment.
13594	LTW_ENG_20070301.0079.LDC2009T13	We became what we hated.''
13595	LTW_ENG_20070301.0079.LDC2009T13	In the film, which opens Friday, Allen's Doug is happily married with a young son but is bored with his mundane job as a dentist
13596	LTW_ENG_20070301.0079.LDC2009T13	Travolta's fast-talking Woody has lost his swimsuit model wife, his fortune and his job
13597	LTW_ENG_20070301.0079.LDC2009T13	Macy's Dudley is a computer nerd who is too shy to talk to women
13598	LTW_ENG_20070301.0079.LDC2009T13	and Lawrence's Bobby is a henpecked plumber.
13599	LTW_ENG_20070301.0079.LDC2009T13	Director Walt Becker -- who at 38 is too young to be a true boomer -- said that every generation goes through crisis points.
13600	LTW_ENG_20070301.0079.LDC2009T13	``I had one after college.
13601	LTW_ENG_20070301.0079.LDC2009T13	I just took a year and a half off to travel and thought, What do I want to do in my life?
13602	LTW_ENG_20070301.0079.LDC2009T13	I think what was neat about the movie is that the (characters) are asking themselves that question: Where is my life going and should I make a change?''
13603	LTW_ENG_20070301.0079.LDC2009T13	All three actors, as well as Becker, had a history with motorcycles.
13604	LTW_ENG_20070301.0079.LDC2009T13	``I financed my college education by buying and selling Harleys with my father,'' said Becker.
13605	LTW_ENG_20070301.0079.LDC2009T13	``We would buy mainly, like, mid-'70s Shovelheads and fix them up here and ship them over to Europe in parts.
13606	LTW_ENG_20070301.0079.LDC2009T13	I had a cousin there who was a mechanic and he would reassemble them.
13607	LTW_ENG_20070301.0079.LDC2009T13	Once we got there we would ride these bikes around with a bunch of friends and sell them for, like, four or five times what we paid for them.''
13608	LTW_ENG_20070301.0079.LDC2009T13	His father, he added, was a weekend warrior biker just like the Hogs.
13609	LTW_ENG_20070301.0079.LDC2009T13	``He's a psychologist and a Baptist minister,'' said Becker, who was born and raised in Pasadena.
13610	LTW_ENG_20070301.0079.LDC2009T13	``When he was, like, in his mid- to late 40s, his friend had this idea -- we're getting 40 guys together, we are going to fly to Wisconsin, buy Harleys and drive them across the U.S. for two weeks.
13611	LTW_ENG_20070301.0079.LDC2009T13	My dad got his ear pierced and bought skull bandanas.
13612	LTW_ENG_20070301.0079.LDC2009T13	I said, `Dad I hope you don't get killed.
13613	LTW_ENG_20070301.0079.LDC2009T13	You are such a poseur.' ''
13614	LTW_ENG_20070301.0079.LDC2009T13	Travolta has been riding motorcycles since he was a struggling young actor in Los Angeles in the early 1970s.
13615	LTW_ENG_20070301.0079.LDC2009T13	``It was economical transportation in California,'' he said.
13616	LTW_ENG_20070301.0079.LDC2009T13	``I would run around to my auditions in a motorcycle.
13617	LTW_ENG_20070301.0079.LDC2009T13	You would store it easily when you left town.''
13618	LTW_ENG_20070301.0079.LDC2009T13	He still borrows friends' Harleys to ride.
13619	LTW_ENG_20070301.0079.LDC2009T13	``For years I had a Honda 450, which is a moderate-sized bike,'' said Travolta.
13620	LTW_ENG_20070301.0079.LDC2009T13	``I am looking forward to owning a Harley again.''
13621	LTW_ENG_20070301.0079.LDC2009T13	Travolta is passionate about bikes because there's a certain sensation to riding a bike.
13622	LTW_ENG_20070301.0079.LDC2009T13	``Your body gets exhilarated and you get excited physically.
13623	LTW_ENG_20070301.0079.LDC2009T13	There's a mental freedom from imagined barriers that you have.''
13624	LTW_ENG_20070301.0079.LDC2009T13	Just like Travolta, Macy tooled around Los Angeles on a motorcycle in the 1970s.
13625	LTW_ENG_20070301.0079.LDC2009T13	But because he was rusty and had never ridden a Harley, Macy took lessons from the film's stunt coordinator, Jack Gill.
13626	LTW_ENG_20070301.0079.LDC2009T13	It was love at first sight for Macy and his machine.
13627	LTW_ENG_20070301.0079.LDC2009T13	``Macy took to it like a fish to water,'' recalled Becker.
13628	LTW_ENG_20070301.0079.LDC2009T13	``There is nothing like it, man,'' enthused Macy.
13629	LTW_ENG_20070301.0079.LDC2009T13	``It is as close to flying as you get on the ground.
13630	LTW_ENG_20070301.0079.LDC2009T13	It feels fantastic.
13631	LTW_ENG_20070301.0079.LDC2009T13	It has a little bit of the patina of the outlaw about it, and there is the nature aspect of it.
13632	LTW_ENG_20070301.0079.LDC2009T13	''If you want to really see a place, get on a motorcycle.
13633	LTW_ENG_20070301.0079.LDC2009T13	``

13637	LTW_ENG_20070303.0059.LDC2009T13	Reporters on Thursday pressed White House spokeswoman Dana Perino on news reports that the administration is backing away from its absolute claims that North Korea has a uranium-enrichment program.
13638	LTW_ENG_20070303.0059.LDC2009T13	This was based on intelligence the White House used to buttress its case that the regime was part of the ``Axis of Evil.''
13639	LTW_ENG_20070303.0059.LDC2009T13	``Have you checked into this North Korea story,'' a reporter asked, ``what -- exactly what our intelligence says about the North Korean uranium-enrichment program?''
13640	LTW_ENG_20070303.0059.LDC2009T13	``I did try to check into it,'' Perino said.
13641	LTW_ENG_20070303.0059.LDC2009T13	``I think what I need to do is refer you to the intelligence community.''
13642	LTW_ENG_20070303.0059.LDC2009T13	Ah, yes, a crowd long known for on-the-record briefings on its sources and process.
13643	LTW_ENG_20070303.0059.LDC2009T13	``We've said for a long time,'' she said, that ``North Korea is an opaque regime,'' so it's hard to be sure what they're doing.
13644	LTW_ENG_20070303.0059.LDC2009T13	``I'm sure the intelligence community continually tried to assess and reassess and look at the information that they have,'' she said.
13645	LTW_ENG_20070303.0059.LDC2009T13	``What we do know is that North Korea tested a nuclear weapon.
13646	LTW_ENG_20070303.0059.LDC2009T13	... So, from our standpoint, that's what we know is happening at the moment.
13647	LTW_ENG_20070303.0059.LDC2009T13	In regards to intel and what they knew and when they knew it, I think I'd have to refer you back to them.''
13648	LTW_ENG_20070303.0059.LDC2009T13	Never mind.
13649	LTW_ENG_20070313.0069.LDC2009T13	Las Vegas' Water Nymph
13650	LTW_ENG_20070313.0069.LDC2009T13	Pat Mulroy grew up in Germany, the daughter of an American father in the U.S. military and a German mother.
13651	LTW_ENG_20070313.0069.LDC2009T13	Her father was a stickler for language -- she speaks without a trace of an accent -- and Mulroy always wanted to live in the U.S.
13652	LTW_ENG_20070313.0069.LDC2009T13	She got her chance when a University of Nevada-Las Vegas dean who knew her program head at the University of Munich offered her a senior scholarship and a teaching assistantship to pursue a master's degree in German literature.
13653	LTW_ENG_20070313.0069.LDC2009T13	``That was my ticket,'' she says.
13654	LTW_ENG_20070313.0069.LDC2009T13	``So I packed up all my belongings, and on Aug. 24, 1974, I landed at McCarran International Airport.''
13655	LTW_ENG_20070313.0069.LDC2009T13	She arrived at night, checked into a motel and encountered her first round bed and mirrored ceiling.
13656	LTW_ENG_20070313.0069.LDC2009T13	The next morning, she peered out the window, expecting Sahara-like sand dunes.
13657	LTW_ENG_20070313.0069.LDC2009T13	Instead, she found herself in the land of kitsch.
13658	LTW_ENG_20070313.0069.LDC2009T13	``I was in shock.
13659	LTW_ENG_20070313.0069.LDC2009T13	The whole thing was like an out-of-body experience.''
13660	LTW_ENG_20070313.0069.LDC2009T13	Except for a brief doctoral stint at Stanford, she has stayed in Las Vegas, first working for Clark County government and then Las Vegas Valley Water District.
13661	LTW_ENG_20070313.0069.LDC2009T13	She married a native Nevadan, and has two college-age children.
13662	LTW_ENG_20070313.0069.LDC2009T13	``It just became home'' says Mulroy, 54.
13663	LTW_ENG_20070313.0069.LDC2009T13	``I had grown to appreciate its quirkiness and how different it is.''
13664	LTW_ENG_20070314.0171.LDC2009T13	LCD Flat-Screen TVs on Downward Pricing Trend
13665	LTW_ENG_20070314.0171.LDC2009T13	If you've been waiting for fast-falling prices of LCD flat-screen TVs to flatten out, you can stop.
13666	LTW_ENG_20070314.0171.LDC2009T13	Now's the time to buy.
13667	LTW_ENG_20070314.0171.LDC2009T13	Or maybe not.
13668	LTW_ENG_20070314.0171.LDC2009T13	Prices have been basically stalled since the retail wars of the 2006 holidays, when LCD TVs, once luxury items, went almost mainstream.
13669	LTW_ENG_20070314.0171.LDC2009T13	But prices will probably plunge again by the end of the year.
13670	LTW_ENG_20070314.0171.LDC2009T13	A 42-inch set currently selling for an average $1,877 could be going for $1,175 -- a drop of more than 35 percent -- just in time for the winter holidays, the iSuppli research group said Tuesday.
13671	LTW_ENG_20070314.0171.LDC2009T13	Already, at some discount and membership stores, you can find an off-brand 42-inch LCD set for under $1,000.
13672	LTW_ENG_20070314.0171.LDC2009T13	``I have a 20-inch LCD set across from me that was $1,500 just four years ago.
13673	LTW_ENG_20070314.0171.LDC2009T13	Now I could get it for $149,'' said Richard Doherty of the Envisioneering Group.
13674	LTW_ENG_20070314.0171.LDC2009T13	``The prices have fallen faster than any consumer electronics item in years, with the exception of DVD players.''
13675	LTW_ENG_20070314.0171.LDC2009T13	If the price falls as much as expected this year, the average 42-inch LCD set will cost only about $80 less than a plasma flat- screen of the same size.
13676	LTW_ENG_20070314.0171.LDC2009T13	For years, plasma was the undisputed flat-screen king, largely because the technology was far cheaper.
13677	LTW_ENG_20070314.0171.LDC2009T13	But now LCDs could rule -- especially among the environmentally- and weight-conscious.
13678	LTW_ENG_20070314.0171.LDC2009T13	``LCD TVs use a lot less electricity,'' Doherty said.
13679	LTW_ENG_20070314.0171.LDC2009T13	``People who consider themselves green tend to buy LCD.
13680	LTW_ENG_20070314.0171.LDC2009T13	And the weight of two 37-inch LCD TVs are about equal to that of one plasma set the same size.''
13681	LTW_ENG_20070314.0171.LDC2009T13	Right now, LCD sets have 22 percent of the market.
13682	LTW_ENG_20070314.0171.LDC2009T13	The iSuppli group predicts that will rise to 51 percent in 2009.
13683	LTW_ENG_20070314.0171.LDC2009T13	This year, the number of raw LCD screens -- each of which contains a liquid crystal gel divided into hundreds of thousands of individual pixels -- shipping from factories will reach 75.2 million, up from 52.7 in 2006, iSuppli said.
13684	LTW_ENG_20070314.0171.LDC2009T13	And the price of the screens to TV manufacturers is forecast to fall 17 percent in just the first half of this year.
13685	LTW_ENG_20070314.0171.LDC2009T13	That will likely to be passed onto shoppers.
13686	LTW_ENG_20070314.0171.LDC2009T13	At the stores, competition is fierce.
13687	LTW_ENG_20070314.0171.LDC2009T13	``At the beginning of 2006, we were seeing 42-inch LCDs at about $3,500 or $4,000,'' said Ross Rubin, an analyst with the NPD Group.
13688	LTW_ENG_20070314.0171.LDC2009T13	``But they were from just a handful of manufacturers.
13689	LTW_ENG_20070314.0171.LDC2009T13	By the end of the year, many more manufacturers were offering LCDs and there was very aggressive retail discounting during the holidays.''
13690	LTW_ENG_20070314.0171.LDC2009T13	What's good for shoppers, though, doesn't necessarily make manufacturers and retailers happy.
13691	LTW_ENG_20070314.0171.LDC2009T13	In December, ``some of the 32-inch brands were as low as $500,'' said Riddhi Patel, an analyst with iSuppli.
13692	LTW_ENG_20070314.0171.LDC2009T13	``That's an awesome price for the consumer but it was hard on everyone in the TV supply chain because it was such a low profit margin.''
13693	LTW_ENG_20070314.0171.LDC2009T13	Since then, LCD prices have stayed nearly the same, or gone slightly up in some cases.
13694	LTW_ENG_20070314.0171.LDC2009T13	But if the experts are right, it's only a rest period between rounds.

13701	LTW_ENG_20070415.0059.LDC2009T13	Suspicious of Iraq's CIA-funded national intelligence agency, members of the Iraqi government have erected a ``shadow'' secret service that critics say is driven by a Shiite agenda and has left the country with dueling spy agencies.
13702	LTW_ENG_20070415.0059.LDC2009T13	The minister of state for national security, a Shiite named Sherwan Waeli, has built a spy service boasting an estimated 1,200 intelligence agents out of a second-tier ministry with a minimal staff and meager budget, Western officials say.
13703	LTW_ENG_20070415.0059.LDC2009T13	``He has representatives in every province,'' a Western diplomat said, speaking on condition of anonymity.

13705	LTW_ENG_20070415.0059.LDC2009T13	Shiite officials say the minister is providing information on al- Qaida and Saddam Hussein's Baath party that isn't being supplied by the Iraqi National Intelligence Service, or INIS, the institution meant to be Iraq's primary spy service.
13706	LTW_ENG_20070415.0059.LDC2009T13	The INIS was established in the spring of 2004 by the U.S. occupation authority and since then has been under the command of Gen. Mohammed Abdullah Shahwani, a Sunni involved in a CIA-backed coup plot against Saddam a decade ago.
13707	LTW_ENG_20070415.0059.LDC2009T13	Over the last three years, Shahwani's agency has been funded by the CIA, according to the U.S. military and Iraqi officials.
13708	LTW_ENG_20070415.0059.LDC2009T13	The service reports directly to Shiite Prime Minister Nouri al- Maliki, but Shiite members of his government distrust the agency, which contains intelligence agents from the Saddam era.
13709	LTW_ENG_20070415.0059.LDC2009T13	For most of 2005 and the first part of 2006, Shahwani was banned from attending Cabinet meetings.
13710	LTW_ENG_20070415.0059.LDC2009T13	``The general feeling is that the intelligence service is not functioning or conducting its work in the proper way,'' said Deputy Parliament Speaker Sheik Khalid Attiyah, a Shiite.
13711	LTW_ENG_20070415.0059.LDC2009T13	The two spy agencies risk becoming open partisans in Iraq's civil war if vying political parties do not strike a real agreement on how to rule the country, one analyst warned.
13712	LTW_ENG_20070415.0059.LDC2009T13	``If no critical compromise is reached, the security services are going to fall apart on ethnic, sectarian and party lines,'' said Joost Hiltermann, Middle East director of the International Crisis Group.
13713	LTW_ENG_20070415.0059.LDC2009T13	``It will be a failed state situation like Somalia.''

13715	LTW_ENG_20070415.0059.LDC2009T13	Shahwani's agency has antagonized Iraq's new Shiite elite since its conception.
13716	LTW_ENG_20070415.0059.LDC2009T13	In September 2004, his men arrested at least 50 members of a southern Shiite party called Hezbollah and detained them for several months.
13717	LTW_ENG_20070415.0059.LDC2009T13	That autumn, Shahwani accused one of the country's main Shiite political parties, the Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq, of being on Iran's payroll and blamed its militia for the deaths of 10 of his agents.
13718	LTW_ENG_20070415.0059.LDC2009T13	The Shiite drive to strengthen the parallel secret service can be traced to the spring of 2005, when Washington, D.C., mindful of Shiite politicians' close ties to Iran, rebuffed then-Prime Minister Ibrahim al-Jaafari's effort to take charge of the INIS.
13719	LTW_ENG_20070415.0059.LDC2009T13	The Americans had invested heavily in creating a strong spy service and had appointed Shahwani to head the organization.
13720	LTW_ENG_20070415.0059.LDC2009T13	Shahwani, who owns a home in the United States, has been a crucial asset to the Americans since the fall of Saddam's regime, providing them access to old army officers, and forming an Iraqi special forces unit, called the ``Shahwanis,'' that fought in the November 2004 battle to retake Fallujah from Sunni insurgents.
13721	LTW_ENG_20070415.0059.LDC2009T13	(End optional trim)
13722	LTW_ENG_20070415.0059.LDC2009T13	Shahwani's service ``is funded completely by the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency, not by the Iraqi government.
13723	LTW_ENG_20070415.0059.LDC2009T13	U.S. funding for the INIS amounts to $3 billion over a three-year period that started in 2004,'' a U.S. military official said on condition of anonymity.
13724	LTW_ENG_20070415.0059.LDC2009T13	Asked about the funding, CIA spokesman Paul Gimigliano said, ``The CIA does not as a rule discuss publicly the details of its relationships with the intelligence services of other countries.''
13725	LTW_ENG_20070415.0059.LDC2009T13	After failing to remove Shahwani in 2005, Shiite officials sought to fill the gap.
13726	LTW_ENG_20070415.0059.LDC2009T13	The minister of state for national security at the time, Abdel Kareem Anizi, lobbied al-Jaafari to turn his post into a fully funded ministry charged with security affairs.
13727	LTW_ENG_20070415.0059.LDC2009T13	``He pushed to provide a service.
13728	LTW_ENG_20070415.0059.LDC2009T13	He was very proactive.
13729	LTW_ENG_20070415.0059.LDC2009T13	He exerted a lot of pressure and requested to make his post a full ministry, but the proposal didn't move an inch,'' a former government official said on condition of anonymity.
13730	LTW_ENG_20070415.0059.LDC2009T13	``He started to recruit informers and sympathizers.
13731	LTW_ENG_20070415.0059.LDC2009T13	He couldn't give them full salaries, but he could give them government privileges and built up a network of informers.''
13732	LTW_ENG_20070415.0059.LDC2009T13	When Anizi stepped down, he was replaced government by Waeli.
13733	LTW_ENG_20070415.0059.LDC2009T13	The service has expanded dramatically in the last nine months, Waeli said, getting around its limited state budget by hiring agents on contracts.
13734	LTW_ENG_20070415.0059.LDC2009T13	The agency provides a hard-line Shiite view in national security meetings, observers say.
13735	LTW_ENG_20070415.0059.LDC2009T13	``It's more Shia, it's slightly reactionary in a Shiite sense,'' the Western diplomat said.
13736	LTW_ENG_20070415.0059.LDC2009T13	``If you talk about (Sunni Muslim) Anbar province, you know he is going to take view largely uncharitable toward the Anbar tribes.''
13737	LTW_ENG_20070415.0059.LDC2009T13	A U.S. official suggested that certain sectarian groups are frustrated with their inability to control the INIS and use it to advance sectarian agendas, and that is fueling the drive for the parallel service.
13738	LTW_ENG_20070415.0059.LDC2009T13	The official also charged that Iran has sought to undermine the INIS, in part because of its close ties to the United States and the CIA.
13739	LTW_ENG_20070415.0059.LDC2009T13	``There might be some friction caused by the way this service operates -- it doesn't operate on a sectarian basis,'' the U.S. official said on condition of anonymity.
13740	LTW_ENG_20070415.0059.LDC2009T13	``There appear to be people in Iraq, and perhaps in one of its neighboring countries, who do not like that fact.''
13741	LTW_ENG_20070415.0059.LDC2009T13	A Shiite official who deals with insurgency issues said that Waeli was trying to steer the service away from a sectarian bias, but the problem was with those surrounding him.
13742	LTW_ENG_20070415.0059.LDC2009T13	``He is trying very hard to move away from sectarianism and say this is a government to protect the people, but some of his officers have sectarian views.''
13743	LTW_ENG_20070415.0059.LDC2009T13	Waeli said his main goals were to crack down on al-Qaida, Baathists, militias and criminals.
13744	LTW_ENG_20070415.0059.LDC2009T13	But his service has no legal charter to be engaged in domestic spying or arresting people and is lobbying to pass a law through Parliament that would formalize its surveillance activities, make it a full ministry and put it in charge of the CIA-funded INIS.
13745	LTW_ENG_20070415.0059.LDC2009T13	That legislation would cap the agency's transformation from a minor state ministry into a pillar of Iraq's security apparatus.
13746	LTW_ENG_20070415.0059.LDC2009T13	But the Shiite coalition itself has not made its mind up about whether to formalize Waeli's powers.
13747	LTW_ENG_20070415.0059.LDC2009T13	Sunnis speak with severe distrust of Waeli's ministry, describing it as sectarian in nature.
13748	LTW_ENG_20070415.0059.LDC2009T13	``I think non-Shiites would find it difficult to be accepted in this ministry.
13749	LTW_ENG_20070415.0059.LDC2009T13	It is a nonprofessional organization,'' said independent Sunni lawmaker Mithal Alussi, who serves as an informal consultant to al-Maliki.
13750	LTW_ENG_20070415.0059.LDC2009T13	(Begin optional trim)
13751	LTW_ENG_20070415.0059.LDC2009T13	Alussi said Waeli's men have been arresting people on raids.
13752	LTW_ENG_20070415.0059.LDC2009T13	In their most controversial operation, Waeli's agents have spied on at least one Sunni Parliament member for alleged terrorist activities.
13753	LTW_ENG_20070415.0059.LDC2009T13	The agents submitted evidence this past winter to the Iraqi judiciary in a campaign to strip Sunni lawmaker Abdul Naser Janabi of his parliamentary immunity.
13754	LTW_ENG_20070415.0059.LDC2009T13	Janabi, a Sunni fundamentalist, is accused of being behind the killings of more than 150 Shiites in the triangle of death, a region just south of Baghdad, where Sunni extremists regularly target Shiites.
13755	LTW_ENG_20070415.0059.LDC2009T13	Parliament Speaker Mahmoud Mashadani, an ally of Janabi, said the investigation was politically motivated, and illegal.
13756	LTW_ENG_20070415.0059.LDC2009T13	``The information depends on an undercover officer from a ministry that doesn't even have the (legal) right to conduct surveillance,'' Mashadani said.
13757	LTW_ENG_20070415.0059.LDC2009T13	Waeli defended his actions, saying his agents are tasked to gather evidence by the government, adding that his men can make arrests if authorized by the prime minister.
13758	LTW_ENG_20070415.0059.LDC2009T13	``We are doing our work according to the law and for the service of the people and so far nothing negative has been said about our security agents,'' Waeli said.
13759	LTW_ENG_20070415.0059.LDC2009T13	The fact remains that Waeli and the rest of Shiite-led government have not pursued any investigations of Shiite Parliament members suspected of involvement in sectarian killings.
13760	LTW_ENG_20070415.0059.LDC2009T13	At the same time, Shahwani's INIS continues to run into troubles with the Shiite elite.
13761	LTW_ENG_20070415.0059.LDC2009T13	Shahwani's most recent controversy involves accusations that his men kidnapped an Iranian diplomat in February in Baghdad.
13762	LTW_ENG_20070415.0059.LDC2009T13	Iraqi Foreign Minister Hoshyar Zebari said four of Shahwani's agents were involved in the kidnapping and have been arrested.
13763	LTW_ENG_20070415.0059.LDC2009T13	Shahwani told the Los Angeles Times that the four detained men belonged to him, but claimed they had been in the area on another mission at the time the Iranian diplomat went missing.
13764	LTW_ENG_20070415.0059.LDC2009T13	Shahwani also accused the Iranians of inventing the story of the kidnapping so they could in fact abduct one of his spies who had been spying on their diplomat.
13765	LTW_ENG_20070415.0059.LDC2009T13	Adding to the confusion, the freed Iranian diplomat has said he was abducted by an Iraqi security force and then tortured by the CIA.
13766	LTW_ENG_20070415.0059.LDC2009T13	(End optional trim)
13767	LTW_ENG_20070415.0059.LDC2009T13	Both Shahwani and Waeli's agencies have been accused of bending the law in a country that has a legacy of military coups, authoritarian regimes and unaccountable security agencies.
13768	LTW_ENG_20070415.0059.LDC2009T13	``In Iraq, everybody spies on everybody, everybody kills everybody,'' Parliament Speaker Mahmoud Mashadani said.
13769	LTW_ENG_20070415.0059.LDC2009T13	``We are still living in a Saddam culture.''

13771	LTW_ENG_20070417.0073.LDC2009T13	32 Killed in Virginia Tech Shootings, At Least 24 Injured
13772	LTW_ENG_20070417.0073.LDC2009T13	Thirty-two people reportedly were killed and more than two dozen injured during a shooting rampage Monday morning at Virginia Tech University in Blacksburg, Va., making it the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history, law enforcement sources said.
13773	LTW_ENG_20070417.0073.LDC2009T13	The unidentified shooter was among the dead, according to officials.
13774	LTW_ENG_20070417.0073.LDC2009T13	The dead were at West Ambler Johnston, a dormitory, and Norris Hall, which houses the College of Engineering.
13775	LTW_ENG_20070417.0073.LDC2009T13	Authorities said the first shooting was reported shortly after 7 a.m. at the dorm and the second about two hours later at Norris Hall.
13776	LTW_ENG_20070417.0073.LDC2009T13	Law enforcement sources said a single shooter was responsible for both incidents.
13777	LTW_ENG_20070417.0073.LDC2009T13	Earlier in the day, university officials confirmed a lower number of fatalities.
13778	LTW_ENG_20070417.0073.LDC2009T13	Virginia Tech Police Chief Wendell Flinchum, speaking at a news conference Monday, said he did not know whether the shooter was a student.
13779	LTW_ENG_20070417.0073.LDC2009T13	Some of those killed were students in a classroom at Norris Hall, he said.
13780	LTW_ENG_20070417.0073.LDC2009T13	``Monday the university was struck with a tragedy that we consider of monumental proportions,'' Virginia Tech president Charles Steger said at the news conference.
13781	LTW_ENG_20070417.0073.LDC2009T13	``The university is shocked and indeed horrified that this would befall us.''
13782	LTW_ENG_20070417.0073.LDC2009T13	Monday's shootings occurred on opposite sides of the 2,600-acre campus, leaving students and workers under siege.
13783	LTW_ENG_20070417.0073.LDC2009T13	The university, founded in 1872, has more than 25,000 fulltime students.
13784	LTW_ENG_20070417.0073.LDC2009T13	The co-ed West Ambler Johnston dorm is one of the largest residence halls on campus, housing 895 residents.
13785	LTW_ENG_20070417.0073.LDC2009T13	Area hospitals treating the wounded have reported at least 10 people are in critical condition and several are in surgery.
13786	LTW_ENG_20070417.0073.LDC2009T13	At least four area hospitals are treating the wounded.
13787	LTW_ENG_20070417.0073.LDC2009T13	On the first day of the school year last August, Virginia Tech was shut down because of concerns that a gunman was on campus.
13788	LTW_ENG_20070417.0073.LDC2009T13	The man, an escaped inmate accused of killing a sheriff's deputy and a security guard, was later captured on the school grounds.
13789	LTW_ENG_20070417.0073.LDC2009T13	The campus, about four hours southwest of Washington, was shut down for the day Monday.
13790	LTW_ENG_20070417.0073.LDC2009T13	Families trying to find students are advised to meet them at the Inn at Virginia Tech.
13791	LTW_ENG_20070417.0073.LDC2009T13	Counseling has been set up in the Merriman Center for employees and students.
13792	LTW_ENG_20070417.0073.LDC2009T13	A convocation has been scheduled for noon Tuesday.
13793	LTW_ENG_20070417.0073.LDC2009T13	The worst mass slaying in U.S. history occurred Oct. 16, 1991, at Luby's Cafeteria in Killeen, Texas.
13794	LTW_ENG_20070417.0073.LDC2009T13	George Hennard rammed his truck into the cafeteria and opened fire on the lunchtime crowd, killing 22 people before turning his gun on himself and taking his own life.
13795	LTW_ENG_20070417.0073.LDC2009T13	At the White House, Dana Perino, deputy press secretary, said: ``The president was made aware of the Virginia Tech shootings.
13796	LTW_ENG_20070417.0073.LDC2009T13	He was horrified.
13797	LTW_ENG_20070417.0073.LDC2009T13	And his immediate reaction was one of deep concern for the families of the victims, the victims themselves, the students, the professors and all the people of Virginia who have dealt with this shocking incident.
13798	LTW_ENG_20070417.0073.LDC2009T13	And his thoughts and prayers are with them.''
13799	LTW_ENG_20070417.0073.LDC2009T13	Carol Chappell, spokeswoman for Lewis-Gale Medical Center in Salem, Va., and Montgomery Regional in Blacksburg, said five of the injured were being treated at Lewis-Gale, which is a 521-bed facility.
13800	LTW_ENG_20070417.0073.LDC2009T13	She said some of the injured at Lewis-Gale were referred from Montgomery Medical.
13801	LTW_ENG_20070417.0073.LDC2009T13	Of the five patients admitted, four were students and one was a faculty member, she said.
13802	LTW_ENG_20070417.0073.LDC2009T13	Two of the most critical were in surgery at 3 p.m.
13803	LTW_ENG_20070417.0073.LDC2009T13	She said 18 students are being treated at Montgomery Regional.
13804	LTW_ENG_20070417.0073.LDC2009T13	Four of the most critical were in surgery in the middle of the afternoon.
13805	LTW_ENG_20070417.0073.LDC2009T13	All were being treated for gunshot wounds and other unspecified injuries.
13806	LTW_ENG_20070417.0073.LDC2009T13	``It's so overwhelming,'' she said.
13807	LTW_ENG_20070417.0073.LDC2009T13	Eric Earnhart, spokesman for the Carilion New River Hospital near Radford and the Carilion Roanoke Memorial Hospital said four people were being treated at New River, which is about 20 minutes from Blacksburg.
13808	LTW_ENG_20070417.0073.LDC2009T13	Three are in stable condition and one is in critical condition, he said.
13809	LTW_ENG_20070417.0073.LDC2009T13	Roanoke Memorial, 45 minutes from Blacksburg and part of Carilion's 10-hospital system in western Virginia, is treating three of the injured, all in critical condition, Earnhart said.
13810	LTW_ENG_20070417.0073.LDC2009T13	Earnhart confirmed that the four hospitals treating patients involved in the shooting were Memorial Regional, New River, Roanoke Memorial, a Level 1 Trauma Center, and Lewis-Gale.
13811	LTW_ENG_20070417.0073.LDC2009T13	Students and staff were notified by e-mail and automated voicemails that a gunman was on the loose and that everyone should stay in their buildings and ``away from windows.''
13812	LTW_ENG_20070417.0073.LDC2009T13	All across campus, people were trying to figure out what was happening, with cell phones sometimes working and sometimes not, the university Web site sometimes working and sometimes not, and the sound of sirens everywhere.
13813	LTW_ENG_20070417.0073.LDC2009T13	Many watched from inside dorm rooms or offices, trading rumors and bad news.
13814	LTW_ENG_20070417.0073.LDC2009T13	Wayne Neu, a professor of ocean engineering, was in his office across from Norris Hall when he heard shots, including what sounded like a police shotgun.
13815	LTW_ENG_20070417.0073.LDC2009T13	``I saw one faculty member who was shot in the arm apparently being led away,'' he said.
13816	LTW_ENG_20070417.0073.LDC2009T13	``I've been here 25 years I've never seen something like this happen.''
13817	LTW_ENG_20070417.0073.LDC2009T13	Matteo del Ninno, a junior from Alexandria, Va., had overslept and was rushing to his 10:10 a.m. class in Norris 200, when his girlfriend text-messaged him to see if he was OK.
13818	LTW_ENG_20070417.0073.LDC2009T13	He hadn't heard anything about shootings but noticed the ambulances around
13819	LTW_ENG_20070417.0073.LDC2009T13	after her warning he went back to his house next to campus and checked all his messages.
13820	LTW_ENG_20070417.0073.LDC2009T13	He's worried about his friends, engineering students who always meet before class in the hall.
13821	LTW_ENG_20070417.0073.LDC2009T13	Staff and students contacted by telephone said the morning's events were unnerving.
13822	LTW_ENG_20070417.0073.LDC2009T13	One woman who answered the phone in the school's Entomology Department said that about 9:45, they were notified that everyone was to remain in their offices and not venture out but were not given any other details.

13833	LTW_ENG_20070501.0152.LDC2009T13	As Clive Cussler stumbled through seven days of trial testimony during his legal showdown with billionaire Philip Anschutz, Judge John P. Shook expressed skepticism about the 75-year-old novelist's performance on the witness stand.
13834	LTW_ENG_20070501.0152.LDC2009T13	``Mr. Cussler is smart like a fox,'' Shook said.
13835	LTW_ENG_20070501.0152.LDC2009T13	``He has got an iron-trap mind.
13836	LTW_ENG_20070501.0152.LDC2009T13	He knows what is going on here.''
13837	LTW_ENG_20070501.0152.LDC2009T13	The judge made the statement April 20 when he huddled with lawyers to discuss Cussler's responses before the jury.
13838	LTW_ENG_20070501.0152.LDC2009T13	Like nearly all of the sidebar conferences held in the high-stakes trial, the meeting took place behind closed doors.
13839	LTW_ENG_20070501.0152.LDC2009T13	Transcripts of the sessions obtained by the Los Angeles Times provide rare insights into legal maneuvering, finger-pointing and posturing in the breach-of-contract case.
13840	LTW_ENG_20070501.0152.LDC2009T13	They reveal how entertainment lawyer Bertram Fields prevailed in persuading Shook to ban testimony about Cussler's alleged use of racial and anti- Semitic epithets.
13841	LTW_ENG_20070501.0152.LDC2009T13	And they show Anschutz's attorneys repeatedly challenging the way Fields sought to try the case.
13842	LTW_ENG_20070501.0152.LDC2009T13	The documents also raise questions about the court rulings and oral arguments that took place inside Shook's chambers.
13843	LTW_ENG_20070501.0152.LDC2009T13	Legal experts say that routinely closing parts of a civil trial to the public and the media violates the U.S. Constitution and California's long-standing ``open court'' statute.
13844	LTW_ENG_20070501.0152.LDC2009T13	``This judge needs a little reminder of the First Amendment,'' said Laurie Levenson, a professor at Loyola Law School.
13845	LTW_ENG_20070501.0152.LDC2009T13	``In no circumstances should every hearing be held in secret.''
13846	LTW_ENG_20070501.0152.LDC2009T13	Cussler is seeking about $38 million in damages based on claims that Anschutz and his movie production company reneged on contractual rights that gave the author ``sole and absolute'' approval over the adaptation of the novel ``Sahara.''
13847	LTW_ENG_20070501.0152.LDC2009T13	Anschutz alleges that Cussler acted unreasonably in exercising those approvals and committed fraud by flagrantly inflating sales of his Dirk Pitt novels to extract a $20 million fee for rights to ``Sahara'' and one other book.
13848	LTW_ENG_20070501.0152.LDC2009T13	Anschutz has lost about $105 million on the adventure film, which starred Matthew McConaughey and Penelope Cruz.
13849	LTW_ENG_20070501.0152.LDC2009T13	Closing arguments continue Tuesday, and the case is expected to go to the jury Wednesday.
13850	LTW_ENG_20070501.0152.LDC2009T13	Lawyers who practice in Los Angeles Superior Court said it is highly unusual for judges to close trial proceedings unless there are compelling reasons such as the need to protect national security interests or trade secrets.
13851	LTW_ENG_20070501.0152.LDC2009T13	Yet one morning last week Shook, a court reporter and several lawyers shuffled in and out of the judge's chambers five times in the span of an hour to discuss rebuttal testimony.
13852	LTW_ENG_20070501.0152.LDC2009T13	The participants offered conflicting explanations for why they convened in private at least 59 times during the 58-day trial.
13853	LTW_ENG_20070501.0152.LDC2009T13	Marvin Putnam, Anschutz's lead counsel, said the hearings were closed at the request of Fields.
13854	LTW_ENG_20070501.0152.LDC2009T13	``I didn't want this,'' Putnam said.
13855	LTW_ENG_20070501.0152.LDC2009T13	``It is beyond extraordinary.
13856	LTW_ENG_20070501.0152.LDC2009T13	I've never seen it.''
13857	LTW_ENG_20070501.0152.LDC2009T13	According to the transcripts, however, Putnam's associates from the O'Melveny &amp
13858	LTW_ENG_20070501.0152.LDC2009T13	Myers law firm argued at least twice against holding hearings in open court.
13859	LTW_ENG_20070501.0152.LDC2009T13	In one instance, an Anschutz lawyer specifically cited ``the problem'' of trying the case ``in the press.''

13861	LTW_ENG_20070501.0152.LDC2009T13	Fields said it was Shook who wanted to hold sidebar conferences in private.
13862	LTW_ENG_20070501.0152.LDC2009T13	``I see nothing sinister about it,'' Fields said.
13863	LTW_ENG_20070501.0152.LDC2009T13	Last week, Fields declined to discuss what took place during several closed-door meetings.
13864	LTW_ENG_20070501.0152.LDC2009T13	``This judge gets very upset when we talk about what goes on in chambers,'' he said.
13865	LTW_ENG_20070501.0152.LDC2009T13	Shook replied: ``This judge doesn't get angry about anything.''
13866	LTW_ENG_20070501.0152.LDC2009T13	In an interview, he said the lawyers asked to retreat to his office.
13867	LTW_ENG_20070501.0152.LDC2009T13	``They wanted to have sidebar conferences in chambers so the jury wouldn't hear them,'' Shook said.
13868	LTW_ENG_20070501.0152.LDC2009T13	``It doesn't matter to me one way or another.''
13869	LTW_ENG_20070501.0152.LDC2009T13	(End optional trim)
13870	LTW_ENG_20070501.0152.LDC2009T13	Before the trial, Fields said in interviews that he was outraged at plans by Anschutz's lawyers to portray Cussler as a ``crazed racist and anti-Semite.''
13871	LTW_ENG_20070501.0152.LDC2009T13	They claimed in court papers that Cussler made derogatory remarks about blacks and Jews while exercising his screenplay approvals.
13872	LTW_ENG_20070501.0152.LDC2009T13	The author has denied the allegations.
13873	LTW_ENG_20070501.0152.LDC2009T13	``They want to get these charges in front of a jury,'' Fields said, ``so blacks and Jews will hate him.''
13874	LTW_ENG_20070501.0152.LDC2009T13	Shook ruled the alleged remarks were too prejudicial to be introduced as evidence.
13875	LTW_ENG_20070501.0152.LDC2009T13	The transcripts reveal that Fields was vigilant about making sure no witness so much as suggested to the jury that his client uttered a racial or anti-Semitic slur.
13876	LTW_ENG_20070501.0152.LDC2009T13	On March 27, Fields raised concerns in chambers about potentially damaging testimony by screenwriter David Weisberg.
13877	LTW_ENG_20070501.0152.LDC2009T13	``If he gets up there and says (Cussler) told me, `I don't want any more blacks around.
13878	LTW_ENG_20070501.0152.LDC2009T13	I hate them' -- that shouldn't be in.
13879	LTW_ENG_20070501.0152.LDC2009T13	He can say anything he wants as long as he doesn't do that,'' Fields said.
13880	LTW_ENG_20070501.0152.LDC2009T13	Earlier in the trial, Anschutz attorney Alan Rader protested that Fields behaved inappropriately by telling a witness who referred to Tom Cruise, ``You know who Tom Cruise's lawyer is?''
13881	LTW_ENG_20070501.0152.LDC2009T13	Rader said that Fields ``announced to that jury, I represent Tom Cruise so I know best.
13882	LTW_ENG_20070501.0152.LDC2009T13	I know more than this witness or any other witness.
13883	LTW_ENG_20070501.0152.LDC2009T13	It is outrageous and it is improper, and frankly, it was arrogant and it poisoned this trial.''
13884	LTW_ENG_20070501.0152.LDC2009T13	After Shook denied a request for a mistrial, Rader shot back, ``I believe Mr. Fields should be admonished and instructed never to pull that stunt again.''
13885	LTW_ENG_20070501.0152.LDC2009T13	Shook replied, ``Well, I agree.
13886	LTW_ENG_20070501.0152.LDC2009T13	I don't think we should make statements that you represent Tom Cruise or any other movie star.
13887	LTW_ENG_20070501.0152.LDC2009T13	I don't think we are going to hear any more of this from Mr. Fields or anybody else.''
13888	LTW_ENG_20070501.0152.LDC2009T13	(Begin optional trim)
13889	LTW_ENG_20070501.0152.LDC2009T13	Anschutz's lawyers also accused Fields of coming ``very close'' during his opening statement to violating a court order that prohibited anyone from telling the jury the reason Cussler had fired his longtime publicist.
13890	LTW_ENG_20070501.0152.LDC2009T13	In a sworn deposition, Cussler said he dismissed the employee for financial improprieties.
13891	LTW_ENG_20070501.0152.LDC2009T13	Cussler appeared to violate the order April 19 when he testified that Shook wouldn't let him explain the firing.
13892	LTW_ENG_20070501.0152.LDC2009T13	``What Mr. Cussler did yesterday, beyond doubt, was intentional,'' William Charron, an Anschutz lawyer, told Shook in chambers.
13893	LTW_ENG_20070501.0152.LDC2009T13	``He had that smile on his face.
13894	LTW_ENG_20070501.0152.LDC2009T13	He is no fool.''
13895	LTW_ENG_20070501.0152.LDC2009T13	Shook concurred that Cussler's remark ``was probably intentional'' and summoned the novelist into his chambers.
13896	LTW_ENG_20070501.0152.LDC2009T13	He told Cussler, ``If it happens again, this case is going to be over.''
13897	LTW_ENG_20070501.0152.LDC2009T13	Earlier, Shook said he wanted to warn Cussler ``in open court on the record.''
13898	LTW_ENG_20070501.0152.LDC2009T13	But an Anschutz attorney balked.
13899	LTW_ENG_20070501.0152.LDC2009T13	``Your honor, if we are going to do that, I request that we do it in chambers,'' Charron said.
13900	LTW_ENG_20070501.0152.LDC2009T13	``The problem is that this is not just litigated in the courtroom.
13901	LTW_ENG_20070501.0152.LDC2009T13	It is also litigated in the press.''
13902	LTW_ENG_20070501.0152.LDC2009T13	Shook replied, ``I see.
13903	LTW_ENG_20070501.0152.LDC2009T13	Good point.
13904	LTW_ENG_20070501.0152.LDC2009T13	I agree.''

13906	LTW_ENG_20070501.0152.LDC2009T13	The California Supreme Court ruled in 1999 that a Los Angeles Superior Court judge violated the state's ``open court'' statute by improperly excluding the public and the media from all courtroom proceedings held outside the presence of the jury.
13907	LTW_ENG_20070501.0152.LDC2009T13	Judge David M. Schacter sought to protect the litigants, actor Clint Eastwood and his former lover, Sondra Locke, from disclosures about their personal lives.

13917	LTW_ENG_20070504.0120.LDC2009T13	TEL AVIV, Israel
13918	LTW_ENG_20070504.0120.LDC2009T13	Under a banner reading ``Failures, Go Home,'' tens of thousands of Israelis from across the political spectrum joined Thursday night in demanding the resignations of Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and his defense minister for their performance during last summer's war in Lebanon.
13919	LTW_ENG_20070504.0120.LDC2009T13	The Israeli leader remained defiant, telling aides that the size and diversity of the crowd would not dissuade him from staying in office.
13920	LTW_ENG_20070504.0120.LDC2009T13	Police said more than 100,000 demonstrators filled Rabin Square in front of City Hall and spilled into surrounding streets.
13921	LTW_ENG_20070504.0120.LDC2009T13	A coalition of army reservists, students and relatives of war dead that organized the protest estimated turnout at between 150,000 and 200,000.
13922	LTW_ENG_20070504.0120.LDC2009T13	It was the largest rally against Olmert's government in the 13 months it has been in office.
13923	LTW_ENG_20070504.0120.LDC2009T13	``Ehud Olmert, you said you work for us,'' Meir Shalev, a renowned fiction writer, told the gathering.
13924	LTW_ENG_20070504.0120.LDC2009T13	``Olmert, you are fired!''
13925	LTW_ENG_20070504.0120.LDC2009T13	The protest was called after an official inquiry panel concluded Monday that Olmert and Defense Minister Amir Peretz had rushed into war without a detailed plan or realistic goals.
13926	LTW_ENG_20070504.0120.LDC2009T13	In 34 days of fighting, the army failed to crush the Hezbollah militia, stop it from firing rockets into Israel or free two captured soldiers.
13927	LTW_ENG_20070504.0120.LDC2009T13	While the panel did not call for resignations, its censure triggered an outcry among Israelis, who view the war as a defeat.
13928	LTW_ENG_20070504.0120.LDC2009T13	By a margin of 2 to 1 in most polls this week, they said they want Olmert and Peretz to resign.
13929	LTW_ENG_20070504.0120.LDC2009T13	Former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the rightist opposition leader, joined Thursday in calling for their ouster.
13930	LTW_ENG_20070504.0120.LDC2009T13	Participants converged from all over Israel on a warm, muggy evening.
13931	LTW_ENG_20070504.0120.LDC2009T13	They included secular and religious Jews, hawks and peaceniks, old and young, settlers in yarmulkes or long skirts, and university students -- a mix reflecting the breadth of disaffection with the country's leaders.
13932	LTW_ENG_20070504.0120.LDC2009T13	``It's wonderful to be here,'' said Debbie Stein, a 47-year-old psychologist.
13933	LTW_ENG_20070504.0120.LDC2009T13	``It's the first time I can remember that people from the whole political spectrum want one government out.''
13934	LTW_ENG_20070504.0120.LDC2009T13	She joined the crowd in singing an anthem called ``We Deserve Better'' that was written for the occasion.
13935	LTW_ENG_20070504.0120.LDC2009T13	Protesters held aloft signs reading ``Elections Now'' and ``Left and Right Agree: Olmert Go Home.''
13936	LTW_ENG_20070504.0120.LDC2009T13	One group carried a mock coffin labeled ``Government, RIP.''
13937	LTW_ENG_20070504.0120.LDC2009T13	Organizers called for a moment of silence for the 158 Israelis killed during the war, which also caused more than 1,000 deaths in Lebanon.
13938	LTW_ENG_20070504.0120.LDC2009T13	``Look at this square, Mr. Prime Minister, it says it all,'' said Ronny Zvigenbaum, speaking on behalf of army reservists.
13939	LTW_ENG_20070504.0120.LDC2009T13	``We are ordinary citizens.''
13940	LTW_ENG_20070504.0120.LDC2009T13	The rally capped a week of political ferment that threatened to topple Olmert from within his centrist Kadima party.
13941	LTW_ENG_20070504.0120.LDC2009T13	In a showdown Wednesday night, dissidents failed to muster a majority of the party's parliamentary caucus against him.
13942	LTW_ENG_20070504.0120.LDC2009T13	It appeared that Olmert would survive the street protest as well.
13943	LTW_ENG_20070504.0120.LDC2009T13	One of his advisers, Tal Zilberstein, told Israel radio that Thursday's rally served mainly to allow part of the population to vent its frustration over the war.
13944	LTW_ENG_20070504.0120.LDC2009T13	``It doesn't mean that Olmert will now think he has to vacate his position,'' the adviser said.
13945	LTW_ENG_20070504.0120.LDC2009T13	Peretz, the Labor Party leader, also has resisted calls to resign but would lose his Cabinet job if he is defeated later this month, as expected, in a party leadership primary.
13946	LTW_ENG_20070504.0120.LDC2009T13	Uzi Dayan, a retired general and chief organizer of Thursday's gathering, said the protest movement would hold another rally in about two weeks, after the release of closed-door panel testimony by Olmert and Peretz.
13947	LTW_ENG_20070504.0120.LDC2009T13	Organizers excluded politicians from the speakers' roster to maintain the movement's broad appeal.
13948	LTW_ENG_20070504.0120.LDC2009T13	But parties on the left and right mobilized supporters to attend.
13949	LTW_ENG_20070504.0120.LDC2009T13	Two members of parliament, Yossi Beilin of the leftist Meretz Party and Effi Eitam of the right-wing National Religious Party- National Unity, teamed to write a commentary in Thursday's edition of the newspaper Ma'ariv.
13950	LTW_ENG_20070504.0120.LDC2009T13	They rejected Olmert's argument that he should stay in office to remedy the flaws in crisis management highlighted by the war.
13951	LTW_ENG_20070504.0120.LDC2009T13	``One cannot accept the evil impulse that so many times whispers in the ear of politicians in distress, that they and only they can rescue their country from a severe crisis that they have created,'' the lawmakers wrote.
13952	LTW_ENG_20070504.0120.LDC2009T13	Roey Tzovel, a 24-year-old mathematics student who hid in bomb shelters last summer to avoid Hezbollah rockets falling near Haifa, said he attended Thursday's rally to make a similar point: ``I realized that if I couldn't count on Olmert during the last war, how can I count on him if another one breaks out?''

13956	LTW_ENG_20070518.0079.LDC2009T13	British Prime Minister Tony Blair, who has announced his retirement amid declining British support for the war in Iraq, said at the White House on Thursday that if he could do it all over again, he would still stand with President Bush and back the war.
13957	LTW_ENG_20070518.0079.LDC2009T13	``The forces we are fighting in Iraq,'' he said of al-Qaida and Iranian-backed terrorists, ``are the same forces we are fighting everywhere.''
13958	LTW_ENG_20070518.0079.LDC2009T13	Noting recent extremist attacks in Morocco, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, Blair said extremists ``are trying to disrupt progress'' around the world and that ``the harder they fight, the more determined'' the allies must be.
13959	LTW_ENG_20070518.0079.LDC2009T13	``This is a fight we can't afford to lose,'' he said.
13960	LTW_ENG_20070518.0079.LDC2009T13	British reporters peppered Blair with questions about whether he was still relevant.
13961	LTW_ENG_20070518.0079.LDC2009T13	Finally, Bush -- who has had no better ally in world politics than Blair -- came to the prime minister's defense.
13962	LTW_ENG_20070518.0079.LDC2009T13	``You're trying to do a tap dance on his political grave,'' Bush admonished British reporters.
13963	LTW_ENG_20070518.0079.LDC2009T13	``You don't understand how effective Tony Blair is.''
13964	LTW_ENG_20070518.0079.LDC2009T13	Calling him a respected world leader, Bush noted, ``When we're in a room, people listen.''
13965	LTW_ENG_20070518.0079.LDC2009T13	Disparaging ``blowhards in the political process ... people who have got something fancy to say,'' Bush said Blair ``actually follows through.
13966	LTW_ENG_20070518.0079.LDC2009T13	He is absolutely the right guy for me to be dealing with.''
13967	LTW_ENG_20070518.0079.LDC2009T13	In a picturesque Rose Garden setting with a display of American and British flags behind them, the two leaders discussed a range of issues from global warming to an Iranian nuclear threat.
13968	LTW_ENG_20070518.0079.LDC2009T13	Bush also took questions on several domestic issues.
13969	LTW_ENG_20070518.0079.LDC2009T13	On Paul Wolfowitz's battle to retain his post at the head of the World Bank in the face of ethics charges, Bush said he admired Wolfowitz's ``heart and his purpose in helping the poor.''
13970	LTW_ENG_20070518.0079.LDC2009T13	Noting that the World Bank board was meeting on the issue, Bush said, ``I applaud his vision ... I regret it's come to this.''
13971	LTW_ENG_20070518.0079.LDC2009T13	On a recent disclosure that top Justice Department officials refused to approve one of the administration's plans for domestic surveillance, Bush declined to comment on reports about the sickbed rejection by then-Attorney General John Ashcroft.
13972	LTW_ENG_20070518.0079.LDC2009T13	But he defended the program, saying, ``No matter how calm it looks here in America, the enemy lurks.''
13973	LTW_ENG_20070518.0079.LDC2009T13	As for the relationship between them, Blair said the current climate in Europe made it easy to score political points by attacking America.
13974	LTW_ENG_20070518.0079.LDC2009T13	``You can get a round of applause if you attack the president,'' said Blair.
13975	LTW_ENG_20070518.0079.LDC2009T13	Bush interjected, ``A standing ovation.''
13976	LTW_ENG_20070518.0079.LDC2009T13	But Blair said that, when the political winds shifted, ``when all of that is cleared away, the battle ... is still going on.''
13977	LTW_ENG_20070518.0079.LDC2009T13	He also said, ``You don't win those battles by being a fair-weather friend.''
13978	LTW_ENG_20070518.0079.LDC2009T13	Bush said that he would miss Blair but that he would work with Britain's new leader, Gordon Brown.
13979	LTW_ENG_20070518.0079.LDC2009T13	``This relationship is one that is vital,'' he said, adding that U.S.-British ties have ``enabled the free world to do hard things.''
13980	LTW_ENG_20070518.0079.LDC2009T13	Pointing to Blair, Bush added, ``The world needs courage.
13981	LTW_ENG_20070518.0079.LDC2009T13	This man is a courageous man.''
13982	LTW_ENG_20070608.0014.LDC2009T13	Soundies Speak Volumes About 1940s America
13983	LTW_ENG_20070608.0014.LDC2009T13	Forty years before MTV and music videos, there were ``soundies.''
13984	LTW_ENG_20070608.0014.LDC2009T13	Between 1940 and 1947, about 1,800 were made, three-minute black- and-white films designed to be shown on Panorams, coin-operated film jukes found in nightclubs, bars, restaurants and other public places.
13985	LTW_ENG_20070608.0014.LDC2009T13	About the size of a refrigerator, the Panoram was a complicated device using a system of mirrors for rear projection on an 18-by-22-inch screen mounted on a stylish cabinet.
13986	LTW_ENG_20070608.0014.LDC2009T13	(They ran about $600 then -- about $12,000 today.)
13987	LTW_ENG_20070608.0014.LDC2009T13	Manufacturing restrictions during World War II doomed soundies: There once were 10,000 operating in North America, but by 1946, that number had fallen to 2,000.
13988	LTW_ENG_20070608.0014.LDC2009T13	Soundies were an opportunity for people to see some of the country's greatest musicians performing for only a dime, though a Panoram wasn't quite as efficient as a regular jukebox: Eight soundies, featuring a variety of musical performances, would be spliced together on a reel, which ran in a continuous loop, so you couldn't really pick out a favorite.
13989	LTW_ENG_20070608.0014.LDC2009T13	Reels were changed once a week, and the fare was broad: big-band swing, country and western, gospel, blues, musical comedy and vaudeville (some surprisingly racy for the era), as well as a good amount of ethnic music and comedy.
13990	LTW_ENG_20070608.0014.LDC2009T13	Soundies are fascinating time capsules not only of music but of social history, dance styles and fashions in 1940s America.
13991	LTW_ENG_20070608.0014.LDC2009T13	``Jumpin' &amp
13992	LTW_ENG_20070608.0014.LDC2009T13	Jivin': Volume 1,'' a new DVD available Tuesday from Acorn Media, contains 27 rare performances, focusing on big- band swing (Cab Calloway, Duke Ellington, Count Basie, Artie Shaw), jump blues (Louis Jordan), jazz stylists (Fats Waller), vocal groups (the Treniers and Delta Rhythm Boys) and classy band-fronting singers (Lena Horne, Billy Eckstine).
13993	LTW_ENG_20070608.0014.LDC2009T13	The 85-minute DVD ($19.99) is an expanded version of a collection put together by Eric Kulberg and Peter Jacobson in the early days of home video.
13994	LTW_ENG_20070608.0014.LDC2009T13	Director Kulberg, a partner in Universal Media, says that when Acorn, which distributes a variety of programs on DVD, with a special focus on British television, saw it, ``they flipped and felt there was a fresh, young audience out there for this material.''
13995	LTW_ENG_20070608.0014.LDC2009T13	Most of the soundies come from the collection of Mike Minoie, a Boston civil servant who started collecting in the '50s, from Kulberg's personal collection and those of fellow collectors, as well as the Library of Congress, the source of Dizzy Gillespie's sly ``Oop Bop Sh Bam'' from a 1946 film ``Jivin' in Be-Bop.''
13996	LTW_ENG_20070608.0014.LDC2009T13	Soundies were, of course, lip-synced, with some artists clearly better at it than others (good: Jordan
13997	LTW_ENG_20070608.0014.LDC2009T13	bad: Gene Krupa).
13998	LTW_ENG_20070608.0014.LDC2009T13	It's funny to see how little some conventions have changed between the soundies era and the rise of MTV: pretty women as props, silly choreography, absurd story lines and broad comedic acting, notably Waller on ``Ain't Misbehavin','' ``Honeysuckle Rose'' and ``Your Feet's Too Big'' and Calloway on ``Minnie the Moocher'' and ``Blues in the Night.''
13999	LTW_ENG_20070608.0014.LDC2009T13	Not all of the selections on the DVD are soundies.
14000	LTW_ENG_20070608.0014.LDC2009T13	Several are Snader Telescriptions, the first music videos intended for television, produced from about 1950 until 1954 and filmed with multiple cameras and live mikes.
14001	LTW_ENG_20070608.0014.LDC2009T13	The DVD includes Lionel Hampton's ``Ding Dong Baby'' and the Duke Ellington Orchestra's ``Sophisticated Lady.''
14002	LTW_ENG_20070608.0014.LDC2009T13	Three hot Jordan numbers come from his 1945 short ``Caldonia,'' while the Treniers' wild performances of ``Rag Mop'' and ``It's Rock, It's Roll, It's Swing'' are from a 1956 television show.
14003	LTW_ENG_20070608.0014.LDC2009T13	A beautiful and impossibly young Horne sings ``Unlucky Woman,'' then watches stride legends Pete Johnson and Albert Ammons blister their pianos in a clip from their 1941 short ``Boogie Woogie Dreams.''
14004	LTW_ENG_20070608.0014.LDC2009T13	Artie Shaw's ``Class in Swing'' is an entertaining short from 1939, while Eckstine's ``Rhythm in a Riff'' is from the 1947 feature of the same name produced by the Associated Producers of Negro Motion Pictures.
14005	LTW_ENG_20070608.0014.LDC2009T13	(Individual songs were later released as soundies.)
14006	LTW_ENG_20070608.0035.LDC2009T13	Free the Old, Fix the Prisons
14007	LTW_ENG_20070608.0035.LDC2009T13	Special to the Los Angeles Times=
14008	LTW_ENG_20070608.0035.LDC2009T13	California's prisons are in crisis, bursting at the seams with nearly twice as many inmates as they were designed to hold.
14009	LTW_ENG_20070608.0035.LDC2009T13	Things are so bad that this month federal judges will begin holding hearings on whether to impose inmate population caps.
14010	LTW_ENG_20070608.0035.LDC2009T13	The Legislature's solution: build 53,000 new prison beds, at a jaw- dropping estimated cost of $7.4 billion.
14011	LTW_ENG_20070608.0035.LDC2009T13	Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger has already started transferring the first of thousands of convicts to other states.
14012	LTW_ENG_20070608.0035.LDC2009T13	But there's at least one safe, simple and immediate thing the state could do that would free up prison beds and save millions: parole inmates who are too old to be dangerous.
14013	LTW_ENG_20070608.0035.LDC2009T13	Prisoners are expensive to confine, and none more so than elderly ones.
14014	LTW_ENG_20070608.0035.LDC2009T13	The typical inmate costs California taxpayers more than $34,000 a year, according to the state Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation.
14015	LTW_ENG_20070608.0035.LDC2009T13	But elderly inmates typically cost up to three times more, primarily because of their greater medical needs.
14016	LTW_ENG_20070608.0035.LDC2009T13	Many older prisoners are five to 10 years ``older'' physiologically than their chronological age, their bodies prematurely worn down from years of alcohol and drug abuse and the stress of prison life.
14017	LTW_ENG_20070608.0035.LDC2009T13	According to the Washington-based Project for Older Prisoners, the typical convict who is 55 or older -- considered geriatric among prison experts -- will suffer three chronic illnesses while incarcerated.
14018	LTW_ENG_20070608.0035.LDC2009T13	And taxpayers foot every penny of their medical bills.
14019	LTW_ENG_20070608.0035.LDC2009T13	That's no small matter in a state where the correctional system has grown to gargantuan proportions.
14020	LTW_ENG_20070608.0035.LDC2009T13	Fifteen years ago, California incarcerated about 105,000 inmates
14021	LTW_ENG_20070608.0035.LDC2009T13	today, it holds more than 170,000, at an annual cost exceeding $8 billion.
14022	LTW_ENG_20070608.0035.LDC2009T13	Health-care costs have grown even faster.
14023	LTW_ENG_20070608.0035.LDC2009T13	The Department of Corrections will spend almost $1.8 billion on medical care this year, double the amount of just five years ago.
14024	LTW_ENG_20070608.0035.LDC2009T13	That's partly because the number of elderly prisoners also has surged in the last decade, the result of baby-boom demographics and ever- lengthening sentences.
14025	LTW_ENG_20070608.0035.LDC2009T13	By the Department of Corrections' own count, it now holds more than 9,000 prisoners 55 or older, many of them already in such dismal health that they couldn't commit new crimes if they wanted to.
14026	LTW_ENG_20070608.0035.LDC2009T13	Nearly half of them are 60 or older.
14027	LTW_ENG_20070608.0035.LDC2009T13	If you move the bar up to age 70, that still leaves hundreds of inmates.
14028	LTW_ENG_20070608.0035.LDC2009T13	Paroling just those septuagenarians could save tens of millions of dollars annually.
14029	LTW_ENG_20070608.0035.LDC2009T13	Of course, not every prisoner 55 or older could be safely released.
14030	LTW_ENG_20070608.0035.LDC2009T13	Many committed serious crimes and are in good enough health that they need to be locked up.
14031	LTW_ENG_20070608.0035.LDC2009T13	But in general, releasing ailing elderly prisoners under the ongoing supervision of a parole officer is a pretty safe bet.
14032	LTW_ENG_20070608.0035.LDC2009T13	Study after study has found that the recidivism rate for prisoners 55 or older is far lower than that of younger ones.
14033	LTW_ENG_20070608.0035.LDC2009T13	And the cost of monitoring a convict in California on parole is about one-eighth that of keeping one in prison.
14034	LTW_ENG_20070608.0035.LDC2009T13	There's a nonfinancial benefit, too.
14035	LTW_ENG_20070608.0035.LDC2009T13	Letting sick, feeble old men and women live out their last days at home with their families is more humane than letting them slowly disintegrate in cellblocks filled with predatory younger inmates.
14036	LTW_ENG_20070608.0035.LDC2009T13	Even those who would wind up alone on the outside, living off Social Security, veterans benefits or welfare still would cost taxpayers less than keeping them in prison.
14037	LTW_ENG_20070608.0035.LDC2009T13	Several other cash-strapped states are releasing nonviolent offenders to save money, including such law-and-order bastions as Virginia and Louisiana.
14038	LTW_ENG_20070608.0035.LDC2009T13	California, like many states, already has little-used policies allowing for compassionate release of sick or elderly inmates deemed harmless.
14039	LTW_ENG_20070608.0035.LDC2009T13	Nobody wants to see dangerous felons let loose just to save money.
14040	LTW_ENG_20070608.0035.LDC2009T13	But letting hundreds of old men and women in poor health go home, under the scrutiny of parole agents, hardly seems like much of a threat.
14041	LTW_ENG_20070608.0035.LDC2009T13	Would we really rather keep old convicts behind bars and cut funding for kindergartens and hospitals?
14042	LTW_ENG_20070613.0145.LDC2009T13	Intellectual Richard Rorty, 75, Dies
14043	LTW_ENG_20070613.0145.LDC2009T13	Richard Rorty, the eminent public intellectual and Stanford University professor, who resuscitated American pragmatism with groundbreaking work that urged philosophers to give up the illusory pursuit of ultimate truths and concentrate on being relevant, has died.
14044	LTW_ENG_20070613.0145.LDC2009T13	He was 75.
14045	LTW_ENG_20070613.0145.LDC2009T13	Rorty died of pancreatic cancer Friday at his home on the Stanford campus, according to the university, where he taught in the department of comparative literature for seven years before retiring in 2006.
14046	LTW_ENG_20070613.0145.LDC2009T13	Called ``an anti-philosopher's philosopher,'' Rorty was a major American thinker whose most influential contribution was ``Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature,'' a 1979 book that marked his shift away from the analytic tradition of G.E. Moore, Bertrand Russell and Ludwig Wittgenstein to the pragmatist camp of Charles Sanders Peirce, William James and John Dewey.
14047	LTW_ENG_20070613.0145.LDC2009T13	With this foundational change in his thinking, Rorty became a target of prickly debate in philosophy circles and attracted critics across the political spectrum.
14048	LTW_ENG_20070613.0145.LDC2009T13	``He did try to rewrite the history of philosophy a little bit.
14049	LTW_ENG_20070613.0145.LDC2009T13	What he accomplished,'' said Richard Watson, a longtime friend and emeritus professor of philosophy at Washington University in St. Louis, ``was getting himself as a philosopher taken very seriously by people in many other fields .... He changed the image of a philosopher in the United States.''
14050	LTW_ENG_20070613.0145.LDC2009T13	Rorty's desire to be relevant led him to concentrate intensely on questions of culture and politics.
14051	LTW_ENG_20070613.0145.LDC2009T13	``Dick appealed to a deeper tradition in Western philosophy'' that turned philosophy into an ``inquiry into the good life, how we can best live in political communities with respect for each other,'' said Russell Berman, chairman of Stanford's comparative literature department.
14052	LTW_ENG_20070613.0145.LDC2009T13	An unabashed liberal, Rorty articulated his view of the good life in a prolific output of essays and articles for journals such as Nation and Dissent.
14053	LTW_ENG_20070613.0145.LDC2009T13	In his writings about closing the wage gap, reducing poverty and fighting social injustice, he was critical of America, yet he insisted that he regarded the country ``pretty much as Whitman and Dewey did, as opening a prospect on illimitable democratic vistas.''
14054	LTW_ENG_20070613.0145.LDC2009T13	His promotion of national pride was at the center of one of his last books, ``Achieving Our Country'' (1998).
14055	LTW_ENG_20070613.0145.LDC2009T13	``I think that our country -- despite its past and present atrocities and vices, and despite its continuing eagerness to elect fools and knaves to high office -- is a good example of the best kind of society so far invented,'' he wrote in his book ``Philosophy and Social Hope'' (2000).
14056	LTW_ENG_20070613.0145.LDC2009T13	His early life as a philosopher dropped few, if any, clues of an unusual upbringing.
14057	LTW_ENG_20070613.0145.LDC2009T13	Born in New York City on Oct. 4, 1931, he was, by his own account, the ``clever, snotty, nerdy only child'' of Trotskyites who worked for socialist Norman Thomas' Workers' Defense League.
14058	LTW_ENG_20070613.0145.LDC2009T13	As a child, he ran errands for Thomas and A. Philip Randolph, who organized the Brotherhood of Pullman Car Porters.
14059	LTW_ENG_20070613.0145.LDC2009T13	By age 12 he had read the ``The Case of Leon Trotsky'' and ``Not Guilty,'' which told of the Dewey-led investigation into the 1936 Moscow trials that found Trotsky and others guilty of plotting Stalin's murder, and ``knew that the point of being human was to spend one's life fighting social injustice.''
14060	LTW_ENG_20070613.0145.LDC2009T13	He was not only precocious but a little odd.
14061	LTW_ENG_20070613.0145.LDC2009T13	When he was 8, he sent a present and note of congratulations to ``a fellow 8-year- old who had made good'' -- the newly enthroned Dalai Lama.
14062	LTW_ENG_20070613.0145.LDC2009T13	A few years later, he developed a passionate interest in wild orchids and eventually found 17 of the 40 species that grew in the mountains of northwest New Jersey.
14063	LTW_ENG_20070613.0145.LDC2009T13	As he later related in an autobiographical essay called ``Trotsky and the Wild Orchids,'' these two poles of his early life went unbound for years.
14064	LTW_ENG_20070613.0145.LDC2009T13	At 15 he entered the University of Chicago's experimental Hutchins College, which admitted students with only two years of high school.
14065	LTW_ENG_20070613.0145.LDC2009T13	He quickly settled on philosophy as his field of study and was taught by such influential thinkers as Leo Strauss and Charles Hartshorne.
14066	LTW_ENG_20070613.0145.LDC2009T13	He absorbed the Chicago philosophers' disdain for the pragmatism of Dewey, who had been a hero to Rorty's parents and their friends, and embraced analytic philosophy, which was allied with science in its drive to explain fundamental principles.
14067	LTW_ENG_20070613.0145.LDC2009T13	After earning a bachelor's in 1949 and a master's in 1952, Rorty left Chicago for Yale University, where he obtained a doctorate in 1956.
14068	LTW_ENG_20070613.0145.LDC2009T13	He taught at Yale and Wellesley before joining Princeton University in 1961.
14069	LTW_ENG_20070613.0145.LDC2009T13	At Princeton, his academic home for two decades, Rorty rose to prominence as an analytic philosopher of language and the mind and published his first book, an anthology called ``The Linguistic Turn'' (1967).
14070	LTW_ENG_20070613.0145.LDC2009T13	Over the next decade, his early influences resurfaced and, in a conversion that Watson described as ``fairly wild,'' Rorty found himself being led back to Dewey.
14071	LTW_ENG_20070613.0145.LDC2009T13	His rediscovery of pragmatism was at the heart of ``Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature,'' in which he wrote that the purpose of philosophy was not to deliver eternal truths but to ``sustain a conversation.''
14072	LTW_ENG_20070613.0145.LDC2009T13	He believed that philosophy should be about ``dialogue, multiple texts ... not about a vain pursuit of absolute certainty,'' Stanford's Berman said of Rorty, who later used his elevated status to promote the work of such continental theorists as Jacques Derrida, the brilliant guru of deconstructionism.
14073	LTW_ENG_20070613.0145.LDC2009T13	``Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature'' was disparaged by many of Rorty's fellow philosophers, who turned ``Rortyism'' into a pejorative.
14074	LTW_ENG_20070613.0145.LDC2009T13	As philosopher Susan Haack wrote in 1997, Rortyism ``induces a factitious despair of the possibility of real inquiry of any kind.''
14075	LTW_ENG_20070613.0145.LDC2009T13	Rorty brushed off such criticisms with apparent ease.
14076	LTW_ENG_20070613.0145.LDC2009T13	His broadening influence was recognized in 1981, when he was named one of the first recipients of a MacArthur ``genius'' grant, which bestows a handsome monetary prize on individuals whose creative work shows originality and continued promise.
14077	LTW_ENG_20070613.0145.LDC2009T13	The next year, 1982, he became a professor of humanities at University of Virginia, where he remained until moving to Stanford in 1996 as a fellow at its Humanities Center.
14078	LTW_ENG_20070613.0145.LDC2009T13	He joined the literature faculty in 1998.
14079	LTW_ENG_20070613.0145.LDC2009T13	He is survived by his wife, Mary Varney Rorty

14083	LTW_ENG_20070621.0080.LDC2009T13	Bush Vetoes Bill to Ease Stem Cell Research Funding
14084	LTW_ENG_20070621.0080.LDC2009T13	WASHINGTON
14085	LTW_ENG_20070621.0080.LDC2009T13	President Bush vetoed a bill easing federal funding for embryonic stem cell research Wednesday, calling on House Democrats to send him a bill funding alternative stem cell research that does not destroy human embryos.
14086	LTW_ENG_20070621.0080.LDC2009T13	``If this legislation becomes law, it would compel American taxpayers -- for the first time in our history -- to support the deliberate destruction of human embryos,'' he said.
14087	LTW_ENG_20070621.0080.LDC2009T13	At an East Room ceremony attended by patients and scientists who oppose research that involves human embryos, Bush also issued an executive order directing the Health and Human Services Department to promote research into ``pluripotent'' stem cells that have the potential to regenerate cell types and body tissues without use of embryonic stem cells, making them prime weapons in the war against diseases.
14088	LTW_ENG_20070621.0080.LDC2009T13	Bush, in his second veto of stem cell research, said he would ``not allow our nation to cross this moral line,'' adding: ``Destroying human life in the hopes of saving human life is not ethical, and it is not the only option before us.''
14089	LTW_ENG_20070621.0080.LDC2009T13	But Democratic House leaders vowed to keep passing embryonic stem cell research bills, attaching them to ``must-pass'' legislation and arguing that embryonic stem cell research offers the greatest hope to combat diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's.
14090	LTW_ENG_20070621.0080.LDC2009T13	``We will continue bringing this up until we have a pro-stem cell research president,'' said Rep. Diana DeGette, D-Colo.
14091	LTW_ENG_20070621.0080.LDC2009T13	Noting that a recent Gallup Poll found that 65 percent of Americans support embryonic stem cell research, DeGette, a leader on the issue, added: ``If the president doesn't at least sit down and talk to us about this, it will be an election issue.''
14092	LTW_ENG_20070621.0080.LDC2009T13	In August 2001, Bush said he would allow federal funding only of existing stem cell lines, banning harvesting of new embryonic cells for research.
14093	LTW_ENG_20070621.0080.LDC2009T13	Some scientists have argued that the previous stem cell lines were contaminated and unstable -- and that stem cells from embryos hold the most promise for combating illnesses, such as Parkinson's disease, spinal cord injuries and strokes.
14094	LTW_ENG_20070621.0080.LDC2009T13	But White House press secretary Tony Snow argued that Bush's policy has actually opened the door to federal stem cell research.
14095	LTW_ENG_20070621.0080.LDC2009T13	``The notion that we are against stem cell research is wrong,'' he said.
14096	LTW_ENG_20070621.0080.LDC2009T13	``No administration has been more aggressive.''
14097	LTW_ENG_20070621.0080.LDC2009T13	And he noted that the veto would not affect private funding of embryonic stem cell research, but that Bush ``has just determined that it is morally inappropriate'' for federal taxpayers who may disagree to fund it.
14098	LTW_ENG_20070621.0080.LDC2009T13	On taking control of Congress in January, Democrats made stem cell research funding a top priority.
14099	LTW_ENG_20070621.0080.LDC2009T13	The bill passed 238 to 194 in the House last month, short of the two-thirds vote necessary to override Bush's veto.
14100	LTW_ENG_20070621.0080.LDC2009T13	A number of high-profile Republicans have supported the effort.
14101	LTW_ENG_20070621.0080.LDC2009T13	Former first lady Nancy Reagan, during President Reagan's battle with Alzheimer's disease, urged Bush to fund the research.
14102	LTW_ENG_20070621.0080.LDC2009T13	And Rep. Michael N. Castle, the Delaware Republican who introduced the current bill, said it ``draws a strict ethical line by only allowing federally funded research on stem cell lines that were derived ethically'' from embryos no longer needed in fertility clinics.
14103	LTW_ENG_20070621.0080.LDC2009T13	But Democrats hoped to remind voters that a Republican president vetoed the funding.
14104	LTW_ENG_20070621.0080.LDC2009T13	In a statement, Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., said she was ``profoundly disappointed'' that Bush ``has once again stood in the face of overwhelming public support to deny the hope of millions of Americans who are suffering from debilitating diseases'' and vowed to continue enacting the legislation.
14105	LTW_ENG_20070621.0080.LDC2009T13	And House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., sent an e-mail to Democratic supporters about the issue, soliciting contributions to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.

14111	LTW_ENG_20070729.0028.LDC2009T13	TAJI, Iraq
14112	LTW_ENG_20070729.0028.LDC2009T13	When U.S. soldiers moved into an abandoned wool factory near here two months ago, they were pounded with bombs, mortar and gunfire.
14113	LTW_ENG_20070729.0028.LDC2009T13	``We were not really well received,'' Capt. David Fulton said with deliberate understatement.
14114	LTW_ENG_20070729.0028.LDC2009T13	The fighting around this town north of Baghdad went on for a month, until local Sunni Muslim tribesmen decided they had had enough of the insurgents in their midst and started working with the Americans.
14115	LTW_ENG_20070729.0028.LDC2009T13	About 220 of those tribesmen now staff checkpoints and have started cooperating with Shiite counterparts who once were their enemies, said Fulton, a U.S. Army company commander.
14116	LTW_ENG_20070729.0028.LDC2009T13	Experiences like these have persuaded the U.S. military command to step up efforts to recruit armed residents as local protection forces, authorizing its officers to use emergency cash and other funds at their disposal to strike contracts with tribal leaders.
14117	LTW_ENG_20070729.0028.LDC2009T13	On Saturday, the top U.S. commander in Iraq, Gen. David H. Petraeus, credited the strategy with beginning to turn around an insurgent haven as he toured the region of dusty villages, citrus plantations, fish farms and palm groves near Taji, about 12 miles north of the capital.
14118	LTW_ENG_20070729.0028.LDC2009T13	But the Shiite-led government, which has been under intense U.S. pressure to dismantle Shiite militias, complains that the policy legitimizes what they regard as the Sunni equivalent.
14119	LTW_ENG_20070729.0028.LDC2009T13	``They solve one problem by creating another,'' said Sami al- Askari, an aide to Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki and member of his Islamic Dawa Party.
14120	LTW_ENG_20070729.0028.LDC2009T13	``This is a seed for civil war.''
14121	LTW_ENG_20070729.0028.LDC2009T13	Al-Maliki wants to screen the volunteers before they are allowed to carry weapons, and he wants them incorporated into security forces under the government's control, al-Askari said.
14122	LTW_ENG_20070729.0028.LDC2009T13	The strategy has been the subject of heated discussion between al-Maliki and Petraeus and U.S. Ambassador Ryan Crocker, both sides acknowledged Saturday.
14123	LTW_ENG_20070729.0028.LDC2009T13	But Petraeus dismissed as ``ludicrous'' a report that al-Maliki felt he could no longer work with the general.
14124	LTW_ENG_20070729.0028.LDC2009T13	``This is really, really hard stuff, and occasionally people agree to disagree,'' he said.
14125	LTW_ENG_20070729.0028.LDC2009T13	With the country's largest Sunni bloc suspending participation in his Cabinet, al-Maliki needs the support of Shiite conservatives in his governing coalition, who are angry about U.S. raids targeting Shiite militants in areas such as Baghdad's Sadr City and the southern city of Karbala.
14126	LTW_ENG_20070729.0028.LDC2009T13	``Petraeus is not answerable before the Iraqi people.
14127	LTW_ENG_20070729.0028.LDC2009T13	Maliki is,'' said Haider Abadi, another one of the prime minister's aides.
14128	LTW_ENG_20070729.0028.LDC2009T13	``There is mounting pressure on Maliki because of these casualties.''
14129	LTW_ENG_20070729.0028.LDC2009T13	Petraeus acknowledged the government's concerns about working with Sunni tribes.
14130	LTW_ENG_20070729.0028.LDC2009T13	``Obviously there is a concern, particularly in the areas where al-Qaida had sanctuaries, that some of them may have had ties with them before,'' he said.
14131	LTW_ENG_20070729.0028.LDC2009T13	``But at the end of the day, situations like this historically have been resolved by the local citizens helping with local security.''
14132	LTW_ENG_20070729.0028.LDC2009T13	In the long term, he said, the goal is to find jobs for the tribal volunteers in the Iraqi security forces.
14133	LTW_ENG_20070729.0028.LDC2009T13	But it can take months to get them screened and trained.
14134	LTW_ENG_20070729.0028.LDC2009T13	In the meantime, ``we applaud when they turn their guns against al-Qaida,'' Petraeus said.
14135	LTW_ENG_20070729.0028.LDC2009T13	U.S. commanders are not allowed to put the fighters on salaries.
14136	LTW_ENG_20070729.0028.LDC2009T13	But they can dip into their discretionary funds to offer rewards or pay for short-term, renewable contracts to protect what the military regards as ``critical infrastructure.''
14137	LTW_ENG_20070729.0028.LDC2009T13	Around Taji, local tribesmen run checkpoints
14138	LTW_ENG_20070729.0028.LDC2009T13	guard schools and water treatment plants
14139	LTW_ENG_20070729.0028.LDC2009T13	and even rebuilt a blown-up bridge in 24 hours.
14140	LTW_ENG_20070729.0028.LDC2009T13	Compensation typically runs from $100 to $300 per person per month, said Col. Mike Meese, a member of Petraeus' staff.
14141	LTW_ENG_20070729.0028.LDC2009T13	The deals are signed by sheiks, who must vouch for their men.
14142	LTW_ENG_20070729.0028.LDC2009T13	U.S. soldiers also collect each person's name, address, fingerprints, retinal scan and other information, Meese said.
14143	LTW_ENG_20070729.0028.LDC2009T13	Petraeus said the U.S. military is authorized to provide weapons only to the official security forces, but his commanders do help the volunteers with food, fuel and, occasionally, ammunition.
14144	LTW_ENG_20070729.0028.LDC2009T13	U.S. commanders report a significant drop in attacks in the areas where they are working with the tribesmen.
14145	LTW_ENG_20070729.0028.LDC2009T13	They say insurgents are offering between $300 and $30,000 to plant a single bomb in areas under the control of tribal volunteers, a sign of how much more difficult it has become to do the job.
14146	LTW_ENG_20070729.0028.LDC2009T13	Petraeus arrived at a strip of stores southwest of Taji in a snaking convoy of armored Humvees that kicked up a huge cloud of dust.
14147	LTW_ENG_20070729.0028.LDC2009T13	Helicopters circled overhead as the general bounded from his vehicle and strode down the street, accompanied by the head of the local volunteers, an Iraqi army colonel and the police chief.
14148	LTW_ENG_20070729.0028.LDC2009T13	He stopped to buy sodas from a tiny grocery store, and chatted with a man who was building several more shops in a market that was all but deserted in January.
14149	LTW_ENG_20070729.0028.LDC2009T13	Petraeus said the cooperation between the Iraqi security forces and local tribesmen was bringing security and commerce back, saying their combined efforts had al-Qaida in Iraq ``knocked off balance.''
14150	LTW_ENG_20070729.0028.LDC2009T13	He cited the capture of a local al-Qaida in Iraq leader.
14151	LTW_ENG_20070729.0028.LDC2009T13	``Yes, he was my friend,'' commented Abu Azam, a tribal chief in a beige dishdasha with a pistol hanging from a holster.
14152	LTW_ENG_20070729.0028.LDC2009T13	``Please, please,'' Petraeus said, as he jokingly covered his ears.
14153	LTW_ENG_20070729.0028.LDC2009T13	``That was before he sided with al-Qaida,'' Abu Azam hastily added.
14154	LTW_ENG_20070729.0028.LDC2009T13	In violence Saturday, four Iraqi special forces commandos were killed and four injured when a bomb targeted their patrol in Samarra, police said.
14155	LTW_ENG_20070729.0028.LDC2009T13	The patrol opened fire after the attack, injuring five civilians, according to police and hospital officials.
14156	LTW_ENG_20070729.0028.LDC2009T13	Also Saturday, police in Baghdad recovered the bodies of 20 men shot execution-style, some of them with signs of torture.
14157	LTW_ENG_20070729.0028.LDC2009T13	And a car bomb exploded in the central Karada neighborhood of the capital, killing at least four people and injuring 10 others, police said.
14158	LTW_ENG_20070729.0028.LDC2009T13	Gunmen targeted the home of a Turkmen political leader in the disputed northern city of Kirkuk, killing six people and injuring six others, police said.
14159	LTW_ENG_20070729.0028.LDC2009T13	An Iraqi soldier was killed and two other injured in a roadside bombing in the city.
14160	LTW_ENG_20070729.0028.LDC2009T13	The chairman of the lawyers union in the southern city of Basra was assassinated by unknown gunmen Friday night on his way home.

14165	LTW_ENG_20070908.0142.LDC2009T13	The day before Hurricane Katrina made landfall, Sal and Mabel Mangano waffled, then decided against evacuating the mom-and-pop nursing home they owned.
14166	LTW_ENG_20070908.0142.LDC2009T13	By morning, 35 of their frailest patients would be dead, drowned in their wheelchairs and beds by the storm surge.
14167	LTW_ENG_20070908.0142.LDC2009T13	On Friday night, after four hours of deliberations, a jury acquitted the Manganos of negligent homicide, charges that could have put them in jail for life.
14168	LTW_ENG_20070908.0142.LDC2009T13	The case raised broader questions about who, if anyone, deserves to be punished for the deaths in Katrina's deadly flooding.
14169	LTW_ENG_20070908.0142.LDC2009T13	While numerous government agencies have been faulted for the disaster, the Manganos were the first and only people to be tried in a criminal court for any of the countless mistakes of planning that led to 1,800 deaths in the flooding that followed the storm late in summer 2005.
14170	LTW_ENG_20070908.0142.LDC2009T13	After the verdict was read, Sal, 67, and Mabel, 64, hugged and sobbed.
14171	LTW_ENG_20070908.0142.LDC2009T13	The Manganos, who still face civil lawsuits in the deaths, declined to comment on their acquittal.
14172	LTW_ENG_20070908.0142.LDC2009T13	"Thank you so very much," Mabel told a juror, and then the two embraced.
14173	LTW_ENG_20070908.0142.LDC2009T13	"I went back and forth for sure, but when it came down to it, the Manganos were not criminals," the juror, Kim Maxwell, 46, a secretary at a power plant, said later.
14174	LTW_ENG_20070908.0142.LDC2009T13	"I just wanted to hug them."
14175	LTW_ENG_20070908.0142.LDC2009T13	Louisiana Attorney General Charles Foti Jr., who had pushed forward with the controversial case, said in a statement: "I feel for the victims of this tragedy.
14176	LTW_ENG_20070908.0142.LDC2009T13	... I hope they will be able to find some peace."
14177	LTW_ENG_20070908.0142.LDC2009T13	Voluminous engineering studies, congressional hearings and a host of other reports have put the blame for the Katrina deaths on government officials.
14178	LTW_ENG_20070908.0142.LDC2009T13	The breachings and overtoppings in the flood defenses have been blamed on the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.
14179	LTW_ENG_20070908.0142.LDC2009T13	Many people pointed at the state and local governments -- and especially their leaders, Louisiana Gov. Kathleen Babineaux Blanco and New Orleans Mayor C. Ray Nagin, both Democrats -- for the chaotic evacuation effort, which left behind many of the poor and infirm.
14180	LTW_ENG_20070908.0142.LDC2009T13	And the Federal Emergency Management Agency, FEMA Director Michael Brown and President Bush were castigated for slow rescue and relief efforts.
14181	LTW_ENG_20070908.0142.LDC2009T13	But of all the potential villains, only Sal and Mabel Mangano have been tried on criminal charges.
14182	LTW_ENG_20070908.0142.LDC2009T13	"Sal and Mabel are the only two people on the planet charged with anything," defense attorney James Cobb noted in closing arguments.
14183	LTW_ENG_20070908.0142.LDC2009T13	The day before Katrina made landfall, Mabel Mangano, the administrator of the nursing home, was getting worried calls from relatives of her elderly residents: Shouldn't you evacuate?
14184	LTW_ENG_20070908.0142.LDC2009T13	they asked.
14185	LTW_ENG_20070908.0142.LDC2009T13	Mangano and staff members said an evacuation would be done "if necessary," and in preparation she called a nursing home in Baton Rouge, out of harm's way, to inquire about available beds.
14186	LTW_ENG_20070908.0142.LDC2009T13	But at some point, the Manganos aborted their evacuation efforts.
14187	LTW_ENG_20070908.0142.LDC2009T13	Maybe it was because they feared the potentially lethal dangers of transporting their frail clientele, or maybe they were trying to avoid the expense -- they have never explained why publicly, and did not testify in their own defense.
14188	LTW_ENG_20070908.0142.LDC2009T13	On the day before Katrina, the Manganos, having stocked up on food, generators and medications, hunkered down at the nursing home in St. Bernard Parish with their son, his wife, the staff, a few of their children and 59 elderly clients.
14189	LTW_ENG_20070908.0142.LDC2009T13	When the levees broke the next morning, the home filled with water up to the ceiling in about 20 minutes.
14190	LTW_ENG_20070908.0142.LDC2009T13	The Manganos and their staff scrambled to put their feeble clients onto plastic- wrapped mattresses, which floated.
14191	LTW_ENG_20070908.0142.LDC2009T13	Those who made it were brought to the roof of the home, then ferried to a parish courthouse.
14192	LTW_ENG_20070908.0142.LDC2009T13	During the trial, prosecutors had suggested that the Manganos were too cheap to evacuate their residents, amounting to a "reckless disregard" for their patients' safety.
14193	LTW_ENG_20070908.0142.LDC2009T13	Noting that three other nursing homes in St. Bernard Parish did evacuate, the prosecutors argued that the Manganos decided to gamble with people's lives.
14194	LTW_ENG_20070908.0142.LDC2009T13	"They stuck their heads in the sand, tails in the air and hoped that Mother Nature wouldn't kick them in the butt," Assistant Attorney General Paul Knight told jurors in closing arguments.
14195	LTW_ENG_20070908.0142.LDC2009T13	The evidence that financial concerns drove their decision, however, was relatively scant: A witness testified that after a hurricane-preparedness meeting several years ago, Mabel Mangano told her, "Unless the hurricane is coming in my back door, I'm not putting my residents through an evacuation and wasting money."
14196	LTW_ENG_20070908.0142.LDC2009T13	The defense attorneys argued that the Manganos chose to "shelter in place" because they cared about their residents and feared the potentially lethal dangers of transporting their frail clientele.
14197	LTW_ENG_20070908.0142.LDC2009T13	In their first vote Friday afternoon, jurors voted 5 to 1 for acquittal.
14198	LTW_ENG_20070908.0142.LDC2009T13	"It wasn't just any one reason," juror Michael Cavalier said afterward.
14199	LTW_ENG_20070908.0142.LDC2009T13	"There were a lot of reasons why."
14200	LTW_ENG_20070908.0142.LDC2009T13	By all accounts, the Manganos' nursing home offered good care to its residents before the storm.
14201	LTW_ENG_20070908.0142.LDC2009T13	Mabel, the administrator, sometimes helped bathe and dress the residents
14202	LTW_ENG_20070908.0142.LDC2009T13	Sal, in charge of maintenance, stopped to spoon-feed those who could not feed themselves.
14203	LTW_ENG_20070908.0142.LDC2009T13	Their son and daughter-in- law helped out.
14204	LTW_ENG_20070908.0142.LDC2009T13	Having been through Hurricane Betsy in 1965, the Manganos also believed that their nursing home had been built on a high spot and was less vulnerable to flooding.
14205	LTW_ENG_20070908.0142.LDC2009T13	The Manganos' fears for residents' safety during an evacuation were well-founded, too, according to expert witnesses who testified that nursing homes often suffer fatalities when evacuated.
14206	LTW_ENG_20070908.0142.LDC2009T13	The trial has been fraught with tears and bitterness, and the relatives of the dead and the Manganos have relived the tragedy.
14207	LTW_ENG_20070908.0142.LDC2009T13	"They killed 35 people," Joy Lewis, whose mother died in the flooding, said after closing arguments.
14208	LTW_ENG_20070908.0142.LDC2009T13	She added that while she doesn't necessarily think the Manganos should go to jail, "they should pay" and the specific form would be up to God.
14209	LTW_ENG_20070908.0142.LDC2009T13	"When they put their heads on their pillow at night," she said, "they'll pay."
14210	LTW_ENG_20070909.0013.LDC2009T13	Why We Should Exit Iraq Now
14211	LTW_ENG_20070909.0013.LDC2009T13	Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama and John Edwards have suggested that there is little difference among us on Iraq.
14212	LTW_ENG_20070909.0013.LDC2009T13	This is not true: I am the only leading Democratic candidate committed to getting all our troops out and doing so quickly.
14213	LTW_ENG_20070909.0013.LDC2009T13	In the most recent debate, I asked the other candidates how many troops they would leave in Iraq and for what purposes.
14214	LTW_ENG_20070909.0013.LDC2009T13	I got no answers.
14215	LTW_ENG_20070909.0013.LDC2009T13	The American people need answers.
14216	LTW_ENG_20070909.0013.LDC2009T13	If we elect a president who thinks that troops should stay in Iraq for years, they will stay for years -- a tragic mistake.
14217	LTW_ENG_20070909.0013.LDC2009T13	Clinton, Obama and Edwards reflect the inside-the-Beltway thinking that a complete withdrawal of all American forces somehow would be "irresponsible."
14218	LTW_ENG_20070909.0013.LDC2009T13	On the contrary, the facts suggest that a rapid, complete withdrawal -- not a drawn-out, Vietnam-like process -- would be the most responsible and effective course of action.
14219	LTW_ENG_20070909.0013.LDC2009T13	Those who think we need to keep troops in Iraq misunderstand the Middle East.
14220	LTW_ENG_20070909.0013.LDC2009T13	I have met and negotiated successfully with many regional leaders, including Saddam Hussein.
14221	LTW_ENG_20070909.0013.LDC2009T13	I am convinced that only a complete withdrawal can sufficiently shift the politics of Iraq and its neighbors to break the deadlock that has been killing so many people for so long.
14222	LTW_ENG_20070909.0013.LDC2009T13	Our troops have done everything they were asked to do with courage and professionalism, but they cannot win someone else's civil war.
14223	LTW_ENG_20070909.0013.LDC2009T13	So long as American troops are in Iraq, reconciliation among Iraqi factions is postponed.
14224	LTW_ENG_20070909.0013.LDC2009T13	Leaving forces there enables the Iraqis to delay taking the necessary steps to end the violence.
14225	LTW_ENG_20070909.0013.LDC2009T13	And it prevents us from using diplomacy to bring in other nations to help stabilize and rebuild the country.
14226	LTW_ENG_20070909.0013.LDC2009T13	The presence of American forces in Iraq weakens us in the war against al-Qaida.
14227	LTW_ENG_20070909.0013.LDC2009T13	It endows the anti-American propaganda of those who portray us as occupiers plundering Iraq's oil and repressing Muslims.
14228	LTW_ENG_20070909.0013.LDC2009T13	The day we leave, this myth collapses, and the Iraqis will drive foreign jihadists out of their country.
14229	LTW_ENG_20070909.0013.LDC2009T13	Our departure would also enable us to focus on defeating the terrorists who attacked us on Sept. 11, those headquartered along the Pakistan- Afghanistan border -- not in Iraq.
14230	LTW_ENG_20070909.0013.LDC2009T13	Logistically, it would be possible to withdraw in six to eight months.
14231	LTW_ENG_20070909.0013.LDC2009T13	We moved as many as 240,000 troops into and out of Iraq through Kuwait in as little as a three-month period during major troop rotations.
14232	LTW_ENG_20070909.0013.LDC2009T13	After the Persian Gulf War, we redeployed nearly a half-million troops in a few months.
14233	LTW_ENG_20070909.0013.LDC2009T13	We could redeploy even faster if we negotiated with the Turks to open a route out through Turkey.
14234	LTW_ENG_20070909.0013.LDC2009T13	As our withdrawal begins, we will gain diplomatic leverage.
14235	LTW_ENG_20070909.0013.LDC2009T13	Iraqis will start seeing us as brokers, not occupiers.
14236	LTW_ENG_20070909.0013.LDC2009T13	Iraq's neighbors will face the reality that if they don't help with stabilization, they will face the consequences of Iraq's collapse -- including even greater refugee flows over their borders and possible war.
14237	LTW_ENG_20070909.0013.LDC2009T13	The United States can facilitate Iraqi reconciliation and regional cooperation by holding a conference similar to that which brought peace to Bosnia.
14238	LTW_ENG_20070909.0013.LDC2009T13	We will need regional security negotiations among all of Iraq's neighbors and discussions of donations from wealthy nations -- including oil-rich Muslim countries -- to help rebuild Iraq.
14239	LTW_ENG_20070909.0013.LDC2009T13	None of this can happen until we remove the biggest obstacle to diplomacy: the presence of U.S. forces in Iraq.
14240	LTW_ENG_20070909.0013.LDC2009T13	My plan is realistic because:
14241	LTW_ENG_20070909.0013.LDC2009T13	-- It is less risky.
14242	LTW_ENG_20070909.0013.LDC2009T13	Leaving forces behind leaves them vulnerable.
14243	LTW_ENG_20070909.0013.LDC2009T13	Would we need another surge to protect them?
14244	LTW_ENG_20070909.0013.LDC2009T13	-- It gets our troops out of the quagmire and strengthens us for our real challenges.
14245	LTW_ENG_20070909.0013.LDC2009T13	It is foolish to think that 20,000 to 75,000 troops could bring peace to Iraq when 160,000 have not.
14246	LTW_ENG_20070909.0013.LDC2009T13	We need to get our troops out of the crossfire in Iraq so that we can defeat the terrorists who attacked us on Sept. 11.
14247	LTW_ENG_20070909.0013.LDC2009T13	-- By hastening the peace process, the likelihood of prolonged bloodshed is reduced.
14248	LTW_ENG_20070909.0013.LDC2009T13	President Richard Nixon withdrew U.S. forces slowly from Vietnam -- with disastrous consequences.
14249	LTW_ENG_20070909.0013.LDC2009T13	Over the seven years it took to get our troops out, 21,000 more Americans and perhaps a million Vietnamese, most of them civilians, died.
14250	LTW_ENG_20070909.0013.LDC2009T13	All this death and destruction accomplished nothing -- the communists took over as soon as we left.
14251	LTW_ENG_20070909.0013.LDC2009T13	My position has been clear since I entered this race: Remove all the troops and launch energetic diplomatic efforts in Iraq and internationally to bring stability.
14252	LTW_ENG_20070909.0013.LDC2009T13	If Congress fails to end this war, I will remove all troops without delay, and without hesitation, beginning on my first day in office.
14253	LTW_ENG_20070909.0013.LDC2009T13	Let's stop pretending that all Democratic plans are similar.
14254	LTW_ENG_20070909.0013.LDC2009T13	The American people deserve precise answers from anyone who would be commander in chief.
14255	LTW_ENG_20070909.0013.LDC2009T13	How many troops would you leave in Iraq?
14256	LTW_ENG_20070909.0013.LDC2009T13	For how long?
14257	LTW_ENG_20070909.0013.LDC2009T13	To do what, exactly?
14258	LTW_ENG_20070909.0013.LDC2009T13	And the media should be asking these questions of the candidates, rather than allowing them to continue saying, "We are against the war ... but please don't read the small print."

14264	LTW_ENG_20070921.0072.LDC2009T13	HIMOWITZ ON COMPUTERS: About as Good as Digital Photo Prints Get
14265	LTW_ENG_20070921.0072.LDC2009T13	It's no secret that many printers are sold as loss leaders.
14266	LTW_ENG_20070921.0072.LDC2009T13	A manufacturer can give away great hardware if he can sell the ink at $35 a cartridge and paper for 25 cents a snapshot.
14267	LTW_ENG_20070921.0072.LDC2009T13	That's where the profit is.
14268	LTW_ENG_20070921.0072.LDC2009T13	Given that business model, I've always been suspicious of printers equipped to print photos directly from a camera's memory card without going through a computer.
14269	LTW_ENG_20070921.0072.LDC2009T13	For me, editing photos is the whole point of digital photography.
14270	LTW_ENG_20070921.0072.LDC2009T13	A perfect shot is rare.
14271	LTW_ENG_20070921.0072.LDC2009T13	With a computer you get a chance to adjust the exposure, crop the image, lighten the shadows, eliminate red-eye and smooth out the occasional wrinkle.
14272	LTW_ENG_20070921.0072.LDC2009T13	All this happens before you commit to paper.
14273	LTW_ENG_20070921.0072.LDC2009T13	So printing straight from a memory card always has seemed to be an invitation to waste money on bad shots.
14274	LTW_ENG_20070921.0072.LDC2009T13	But I've changed my mind after spending a week with the new Epson PictureMate Dash.
14275	LTW_ENG_20070921.0072.LDC2009T13	The latest in Epson's line of small-format printers turns out spectacular 4- by 6-inch photos in 45 seconds -- with or without a computer.
14276	LTW_ENG_20070921.0072.LDC2009T13	A caveat: This compact machine is strictly for snapshot-sized prints.
14277	LTW_ENG_20070921.0072.LDC2009T13	But at $99.99, it's small and inexpensive enough to keep next to your regular printer, especially if you're the family photographer and expect to churn out a lot of prints.
14278	LTW_ENG_20070921.0072.LDC2009T13	At 26 cents for paper and ink combined, PictureMate shots are slightly more expensive than online photofinishers, but relatively cheap for at-home printing.
14279	LTW_ENG_20070921.0072.LDC2009T13	For many photographers, instant gratification is well worth the extra pennies.
14280	LTW_ENG_20070921.0072.LDC2009T13	With a 6- by 8-inch footprint, the PictureMate Dash doesn't claim much desktop real estate.
14281	LTW_ENG_20070921.0072.LDC2009T13	And s etup was a snap: I inserted a print cartridge, flipped up the lid, pulled up the hinged LCD display window and loaded 4 x 6 photo paper from the top.
14282	LTW_ENG_20070921.0072.LDC2009T13	A handful of buttons on the top control the printer with the aid of on-screen menus
14283	LTW_ENG_20070921.0072.LDC2009T13	front-panel slots accommodate all popular memory cards.
14284	LTW_ENG_20070921.0072.LDC2009T13	There are two USB ports, one for a PC and another for cameras that support direct printing.
14285	LTW_ENG_20070921.0072.LDC2009T13	A wireless Bluetooth adapter is available for the cable-challenged, and a $50 battery pack will print 140 photos between charges if you're on the road.
14286	LTW_ENG_20070921.0072.LDC2009T13	Brushing skepticism aside, I began work without hooking the PictureMate to a PC.
14287	LTW_ENG_20070921.0072.LDC2009T13	I popped a Secure Digital memory card loaded with vacation pictures into the slot, and a few seconds later I was viewing the images on the surprisingly bright, 3.6-inch LCD screen.
14288	LTW_ENG_20070921.0072.LDC2009T13	The buttons and menus made navigation easy -- I could view one shot at time or peruse a lineup of thumbnail images (actually, in that small window, they're really "pinkynail" images, but still viewable).
14289	LTW_ENG_20070921.0072.LDC2009T13	One irritant of digital photography is that cameras record images with a 4-to-3 aspect ratio -- the same proportion as standard TV screens and PC monitors.
14290	LTW_ENG_20070921.0072.LDC2009T13	Unfortunately, most commercial photo paper and picture frames are designed to accommodate 4- by 6-inch prints, with their elongated aspect ratio.
14291	LTW_ENG_20070921.0072.LDC2009T13	That means you have to crop most images slightly to make them fit properly.
14292	LTW_ENG_20070921.0072.LDC2009T13	The PictureMate made this cropping chore surprisingly easy from the control panel.
14293	LTW_ENG_20070921.0072.LDC2009T13	Same for adjusting basic exposure and color settings.
14294	LTW_ENG_20070921.0072.LDC2009T13	What amazed me was how little adjustment most decent exposures needed.
14295	LTW_ENG_20070921.0072.LDC2009T13	With automatic enhancement turned on, the PictureMate churned out one gorgeous, well-balanced glossy photo after another.
14296	LTW_ENG_20070921.0072.LDC2009T13	Each one took about 45 seconds, which is more than twice as fast as my general-purpose printer, an aging but reliable HP Photosmart 1100.
14297	LTW_ENG_20070921.0072.LDC2009T13	Also, to my surprise, the PictureMate accurately removed red-eye from several flash pictures and did its best to adjust for some badly exposed shots -- although it couldn't perform miracles.
14298	LTW_ENG_20070921.0072.LDC2009T13	Among other bells and whistles, the PictureMate prints in black- and-white or sepia, and it offers multiple photo layouts.
14299	LTW_ENG_20070921.0072.LDC2009T13	They include thumbnail images of all the photos on a card, dual wallet-size or four mini-wallet-size prints, double passport-size photos, 3- or 4-inch square images, and other entertaining if less-than-useful options.
14300	LTW_ENG_20070921.0072.LDC2009T13	When I finally got around to hooking up the PictureMate to my PC, the drivers installed without a problem under Windows XP.
14301	LTW_ENG_20070921.0072.LDC2009T13	For real editing, Epson bundles a version of ArcSoft PhotoImpression, a quirky but reasonably competent entry-level program.
14302	LTW_ENG_20070921.0072.LDC2009T13	It produced excellent prints, as did Adobe PhotoShop Elements and Microsoft's Digital Imaging, the two photo-editing programs I normally use.
14303	LTW_ENG_20070921.0072.LDC2009T13	For prints with a long life, I usually recommend photofinishing services, which use real photographic paper and chemistry, instead of ink.
14304	LTW_ENG_20070921.0072.LDC2009T13	But Epson now claims its inks will last 96 years under glass and 200 years in a closed album -- a lot longer than I'll ever last.
14305	LTW_ENG_20070921.0072.LDC2009T13	Can you believe those claims?
14306	LTW_ENG_20070921.0072.LDC2009T13	Who knows, since tests can only simulate the effects of time.
14307	LTW_ENG_20070921.0072.LDC2009T13	But there's no doubt that today's inks are more permanent than early formulas, which were prone to smudging and fading.
14308	LTW_ENG_20070921.0072.LDC2009T13	Unlike most competitors, Epson bundles its ink cartridge and paper in PrintPaks, which cost $40 for 150 glossy photos (26 cents a shot) or $35 for 100 matte prints (35 cents each).
14309	LTW_ENG_20070921.0072.LDC2009T13	That makes Epson consumable supplies hard to compare directly with Hewlett-Packard, Canon and other vendors who sell ink and paper separately.
14310	LTW_ENG_20070921.0072.LDC2009T13	But my take is that the per-print price is on the low end, considering the quality.
14311	LTW_ENG_20070921.0072.LDC2009T13	For those with bigger budgets and more ambition, Epson makes a $200 version of this printer called the PictureMate Zoom with a built-in CD burner.
14312	LTW_ENG_20070921.0072.LDC2009T13	This accessory allows users to make photo CDs for friends and family, but it sounds pretty expensive for marginal additional utility.
14313	LTW_ENG_20070921.0072.LDC2009T13	Bottom line: Given its reasonable upfront cost, superb images and economy of operation, it's hard to find much fault with the basic PictureMate Dash.
14314	LTW_ENG_20070921.0072.LDC2009T13	If you're getting started with digital photography and don't want to use a computer as middleman, the PictureMate Dash does a great job with images straight out of the camera.
14315	LTW_ENG_20070921.0072.LDC2009T13	If you're an experienced digital photographer and want a gadget that can spit out a stream of high-quality snapshots in short order, it's a nifty gadget.

14317	LTW_ENG_20071008.0026.LDC2009T13	Costa Rica Appears to Seal CAFTA
14318	LTW_ENG_20071008.0026.LDC2009T13	MEXICO CITY
14319	LTW_ENG_20071008.0026.LDC2009T13	Costa Rican voters gave an almost certain thumbs up to a controversial free-trade agreement with the United States in a national referendum that had bitterly divided that Latin America nation.
14320	LTW_ENG_20071008.0026.LDC2009T13	With 90 percent of the votes counted, 51 percent were backing the Central American Free Trade Agreement, with 48 percent rejecting it, according to official results.
14321	LTW_ENG_20071008.0026.LDC2009T13	The apparent approval of CAFTA capped a roller coaster couple of weeks that saw support for the pact build, plunge, and then rise again amid a dramatic series of events that including a leaked memo, the resignation of a high-level Costa Rican official and public pressure from the White House for Costa Ricans to support the agreement.
14322	LTW_ENG_20071008.0026.LDC2009T13	The agreement would eliminate nearly all trade barriers, such as tariffs and quotas, between the U.S. and the other six participants over the next 10 years.
14323	LTW_ENG_20071008.0026.LDC2009T13	Pro-CAFTA forces were jubilant Sunday night, dancing and cheering when the election tribunal announced early results of the referendum.
14324	LTW_ENG_20071008.0026.LDC2009T13	Alfredo Volio, head of the "Si" or "Yes" campaign, was ecstatic.
14325	LTW_ENG_20071008.0026.LDC2009T13	The agreement will bring the divided country together again, he said.
14326	LTW_ENG_20071008.0026.LDC2009T13	"Now we're one whole," Volio said.
14327	LTW_ENG_20071008.0026.LDC2009T13	"There is no `Yes.'
14328	LTW_ENG_20071008.0026.LDC2009T13	There is no `No.'
14329	LTW_ENG_20071008.0026.LDC2009T13	Only Costa Rica."
14330	LTW_ENG_20071008.0026.LDC2009T13	Costa Rica is the first nation to put a trade agreement to a national referendum.
14331	LTW_ENG_20071008.0026.LDC2009T13	President Oscar Arias said it was an important moment for Costa Rica's democracy because it showed that "decisions don't have to be taken with the edge of a sword or the rain of cannon fire, but with an X on a little piece of paper."
14332	LTW_ENG_20071008.0026.LDC2009T13	CAFTA opponents retreated behind closed doors, vowing to review the results before making a decision about what to do next.
14333	LTW_ENG_20071008.0026.LDC2009T13	Many blamed a campaign of dirty tricks by CAFTA backers in the nation and unrelenting pressure from the United States for scaring voters into backing the deal.
14334	LTW_ENG_20071008.0026.LDC2009T13	"Scare tactics worked," said Mark Weisbrot, co-director for the Center for Economic Policy and Research in Washington who opposed CAFTA.
14335	LTW_ENG_20071008.0026.LDC2009T13	In recent days, the White House and office of the U.S. trade representative issued statements informing Costa Rican citizens that the administration wouldn't negotiate a new agreement if CAFTA was rejected.
14336	LTW_ENG_20071008.0026.LDC2009T13	They also cast doubt on whether existing trade preferences on Costa Rican products that expire in September 2008 would be extended.
14337	LTW_ENG_20071008.0026.LDC2009T13	College Student Jose Vargas said that the recent statements from the U.S. government that there would be no possibility of renegotiating CAFTA caused him concern.
14338	LTW_ENG_20071008.0026.LDC2009T13	"Really, it makes you think," he said.
14339	LTW_ENG_20071008.0026.LDC2009T13	Costa Rica was the only nation in the seven-member pact that hadn't ratified the agreement, which includes the United States, Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua.
14340	LTW_ENG_20071008.0026.LDC2009T13	The deal dismantles most trade barriers between the partners within a decade.
14341	LTW_ENG_20071008.0026.LDC2009T13	Many consider the accord to be a Central American version of NAFTA, the landmark 1994 trade agreement between the U.S., Canada and Mexico.
14342	LTW_ENG_20071008.0026.LDC2009T13	Costa Rica's approval would be a big win for the Bush administration, which has touted CAFTA as a model for multilateral pacts it would like to replicate worldwide.
14343	LTW_ENG_20071008.0026.LDC2009T13	Trade experts say a "no" vote by Costa Rica -- a stable, free-market democracy and close ally of the United States -- would reverberate across the region.
14344	LTW_ENG_20071008.0026.LDC2009T13	CAFTA supporters say it's a way to bullet-proof its trade access to the United States, the destination for about half of Costa Rica's exports of coffee, fruit, apparel and high-tech products.
14345	LTW_ENG_20071008.0026.LDC2009T13	Critics feared it would mean a flood of cheap U.S. farm imports and damage state-run companies, endangering funding for Cost Rica's welfare state.
14346	LTW_ENG_20071008.0026.LDC2009T13	The agreement exposes state-run sectors such as telecommunications and insurance to competition from foreign companies.
14347	LTW_ENG_20071008.0026.LDC2009T13	"It seriously hurts the poor and it has benefits for the wealthy class," said 29-year-old student Luis Sanchez.
14348	LTW_ENG_20071008.0026.LDC2009T13	The United States has struggled recently to push its trade agenda in Latin America.
14349	LTW_ENG_20071008.0026.LDC2009T13	A planned Free Trade Area for the Americas plan has stalled largely because of opposition from regional giant Brazil.
14350	LTW_ENG_20071008.0026.LDC2009T13	The referendum split Costa Rica, a coffee-producing nation of 4 million people known for its political stability in a region that was torn by civil wars in the 1980s.
14351	LTW_ENG_20071008.0026.LDC2009T13	In the largest march in Costa Rica in years, about 100,000 people filled the streets of the capital last weekend to protest the trade pact.

14356	LTW_ENG_20071027.0052.LDC2009T13	`Macbeth' Gets It Half Right
14357	LTW_ENG_20071027.0052.LDC2009T13	NEW YORK
14358	LTW_ENG_20071027.0052.LDC2009T13	"Macbeth" occupies a special place in Verdi's career.
14359	LTW_ENG_20071027.0052.LDC2009T13	After its 1847 premiere (Verdi revised it in 1865), the composer dedicated it to his beloved father-in-law, calling it "dearer to me than all my other operas."
14360	LTW_ENG_20071027.0052.LDC2009T13	Verdi reportedly made the first Macbeth and Lady Macbeth rehearse their great duet 150 times -- the last time with cloaks over their costumes, in the theater lobby, while the world premiere audience waited impatiently.
14361	LTW_ENG_20071027.0052.LDC2009T13	With its bleak E-minor tonalities and eerie, muted woodwind writing, "Macbeth" is a nightmare in music.
14362	LTW_ENG_20071027.0052.LDC2009T13	Giddy ceremonial numbers sound with brutal irony, and the grief of the Scottish people and the hero Macduff take on an almost unbearable pathos.
14363	LTW_ENG_20071027.0052.LDC2009T13	The Metropolitan Opera, which last performed "Macbeth" in 1988, got some of this right in its new production.
14364	LTW_ENG_20071027.0052.LDC2009T13	In the Serbian baritone Zeljko Lucic, it has a Macbeth of the highest caliber, vocally and dramatically.
14365	LTW_ENG_20071027.0052.LDC2009T13	Lucic sang Monday with unfailing beauty at all levels of dynamics, from a tortured whisper to a confident, embracing full voice, his sound sometimes seeming to issue from a twilight world of anguish.
14366	LTW_ENG_20071027.0052.LDC2009T13	The evening's highlight came in the last scene, when Lucic's Macbeth, broken and bewildered, poured out "Pieta, rispetto, amore" with a buttery legato and soft-grained but potent, soulful tone.
14367	LTW_ENG_20071027.0052.LDC2009T13	Alas, his Lady Macbeth was not remotely his equal.
14368	LTW_ENG_20071027.0052.LDC2009T13	Maria Guleghina gave forth an ear-splitting array of shrieks and squeaks, sometimes breathing in the middle of words, sometimes omitting consonants altogether when the going got rougher.
14369	LTW_ENG_20071027.0052.LDC2009T13	By and large, the sounds she emitted had only a glancing relationship to Verdi's music.
14370	LTW_ENG_20071027.0052.LDC2009T13	The less said about her titter-inducing histrionics, the better.
14371	LTW_ENG_20071027.0052.LDC2009T13	As Macduff, tenor Dimitri Pittas sang "Ah, la paterno mano" with a bright and pleasing, but monochromatic, timbre, wanting a touch more abandon.
14372	LTW_ENG_20071027.0052.LDC2009T13	A grave, dignified Banquo, John Relyea offered a fine sense of style and unfocused tone.
14373	LTW_ENG_20071027.0052.LDC2009T13	Russell Thomas was Malcolm, delivering his handful of lines with zest and incisiveness.
14374	LTW_ENG_20071027.0052.LDC2009T13	The Scottish people are a character unto themselves in Verdi's nationalistic reading of Shakespeare's tragedy, and the Metropolitan Opera Chorus under Donald Palumbo sang splendidly.
14375	LTW_ENG_20071027.0052.LDC2009T13	As shaped by conductor James Levine, the desolate chorus "Patria oppressa" throbbed like a wound, the choristers' sound ranging from a howl of grief to weary, halting whimpers.
14376	LTW_ENG_20071027.0052.LDC2009T13	Levine's savage, venomous reading of the score was beyond praise, studded with grim, yawning silences and chords that thudded and crashed with the finality of death.
14377	LTW_ENG_20071027.0052.LDC2009T13	Mark Thompson's handsome black sets -- including a vertiginous cyclorama against which a forest festered in bruise-like purples and blues -- were filled by director Adrian Noble with inanities: witches decked out like Mary Poppins gone bad, Lady Macbeth bumping and grinding her way through her drinking song like a tenth-rate Carmen, pointless gropings and swinging lamps.
14378	LTW_ENG_20071027.0052.LDC2009T13	Verdi's dearest opera deserved better.
14379	LTW_ENG_20071027.0052.LDC2009T13	"MacBeth," at the Metropolitan Opera, Lincoln Center.
14380	LTW_ENG_20071102.0047.LDC2009T13	Candidates for the Holiday Shopping List
14381	LTW_ENG_20071102.0047.LDC2009T13	A few months ago, no list of the upcoming fall season's most anticipated video games would have been complete without "Grand Theft Auto IV" -- but that was before the game was delayed until next year.
14382	LTW_ENG_20071102.0047.LDC2009T13	So what's left for gamers?
14383	LTW_ENG_20071102.0047.LDC2009T13	Plenty -- and we're not even including "Halo 3," which doesn't make our cut because it's already in stores.
14384	LTW_ENG_20071102.0047.LDC2009T13	In fact, despite a sequel-heavy release slate for the holiday season, only a couple such titles are included here.
14385	LTW_ENG_20071102.0047.LDC2009T13	These games look promising enough to deserve spots on your holiday wish list:
14386	LTW_ENG_20071102.0047.LDC2009T13	"Mass Effect"
14387	LTW_ENG_20071102.0047.LDC2009T13	Platform: Xbox 360
14388	LTW_ENG_20071102.0047.LDC2009T13	Release date: Nov. 20
14389	LTW_ENG_20071102.0047.LDC2009T13	Genre: Action/role-playing
14390	LTW_ENG_20071102.0047.LDC2009T13	If this one ends up being nearly as good as it looks in previews, expect it to land near the top of many year-end "best of" lists.
14391	LTW_ENG_20071102.0047.LDC2009T13	From the developer of "Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic" and "Jade Empire," "Mass Effect" puts players into the shoes of a human who must accomplish a familiar goal: Stop the extinction of all intelligent life in the galaxy.
14392	LTW_ENG_20071102.0047.LDC2009T13	But "Mass Effect" aims to distinguish itself in how players choose to accomplish that quest.
14393	LTW_ENG_20071102.0047.LDC2009T13	Moral choices promise to shape how others perceive your character -- and not as purely good or evil, but as a mixture of both.
14394	LTW_ENG_20071102.0047.LDC2009T13	"Rock Band"
14395	LTW_ENG_20071102.0047.LDC2009T13	Platform: Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 2
14396	LTW_ENG_20071102.0047.LDC2009T13	Release date: Nov. 23 (Xbox 360, PS3)
14397	LTW_ENG_20071102.0047.LDC2009T13	Dec. 10 (PS2)
14398	LTW_ENG_20071102.0047.LDC2009T13	Genre: Rhythm
14399	LTW_ENG_20071102.0047.LDC2009T13	Sure, the "Guitar Hero" series has the pedigree (and a new version, "Guitar Hero III," out this week), but "Rock Band" has the buzz.
14400	LTW_ENG_20071102.0047.LDC2009T13	As well it should -- by turning your family room into a concert hall, it's poised to give "Guitar Hero" all it can handle in the battle of the virtual bands.
14401	LTW_ENG_20071102.0047.LDC2009T13	The "Rock Band" bundle will include the game, a guitar, a drum set and a microphone, for a whopping $170 ($160 for the PS2 version) -- and that's not including a second guitar, which the game also supports.
14402	LTW_ENG_20071102.0047.LDC2009T13	Although you could buy the game by itself, it wouldn't be much fun, not when it includes the master tracks of songs by such bands as Nirvana, The Who, The Rolling Stones, Metallica and Foo Fighters.
14403	LTW_ENG_20071102.0047.LDC2009T13	Rock on.
14404	LTW_ENG_20071102.0047.LDC2009T13	"Assassin's Creed"
14405	LTW_ENG_20071102.0047.LDC2009T13	Platform: Xbox 360, PS3, PCs
14406	LTW_ENG_20071102.0047.LDC2009T13	Release date: Nov. 13
14407	LTW_ENG_20071102.0047.LDC2009T13	Genre: Action/adventure
14408	LTW_ENG_20071102.0047.LDC2009T13	Plenty of games have stressed stealth, but none has starred a blade-wielding assassin in 12th-century Jerusalem.
14409	LTW_ENG_20071102.0047.LDC2009T13	That's just one reason we can't wait for "Assassin's Creed" -- one of many reasons, actually.
14410	LTW_ENG_20071102.0047.LDC2009T13	As Altair, you can scale the sides of buildings, scamper along rooftops and dive into bales of hay.
14411	LTW_ENG_20071102.0047.LDC2009T13	The catch?
14412	LTW_ENG_20071102.0047.LDC2009T13	You must do so without drawing too much attention to yourself, lest you face the wrath of guards or passersby.
14413	LTW_ENG_20071102.0047.LDC2009T13	From the early looks we've had of the game, the trick is knowing when to take flight and when to slow down, bow your head and blend in with the crowd.
14414	LTW_ENG_20071102.0047.LDC2009T13	Of course, fighting is necessary at times -- but a good assassin knows his job is much easier if his prey doesn't suspect he's coming.
14415	LTW_ENG_20071102.0047.LDC2009T13	"Super Mario Galaxy"
14416	LTW_ENG_20071102.0047.LDC2009T13	Platform: Nintendo Wii
14417	LTW_ENG_20071102.0047.LDC2009T13	Release date: Nov. 12
14418	LTW_ENG_20071102.0047.LDC2009T13	Genre: Platformer
14419	LTW_ENG_20071102.0047.LDC2009T13	Mario takes center stage for Nintendo once again in a game likely to be one of the holiday season's bestsellers.
14420	LTW_ENG_20071102.0047.LDC2009T13	His job, as before, is to traverse a 3-D world full of obstacles and enemies to save Princess Peach, who apparently has yet to figure out how to keep from being kidnapped by the evil Bowser.
14421	LTW_ENG_20071102.0047.LDC2009T13	This time, though, Mario's actions are managed by the motion- sensing Wii controller.
14422	LTW_ENG_20071102.0047.LDC2009T13	And the worlds he must explore are unlike any others in previous games.
14423	LTW_ENG_20071102.0047.LDC2009T13	As the title suggests, Mario must jump from galaxy to galaxy conquering mini-planets in his quest to save the ever-imperiled Peach.
14424	LTW_ENG_20071102.0047.LDC2009T13	Again.
14425	LTW_ENG_20071102.0047.LDC2009T13	"The Simpsons Game"
14426	LTW_ENG_20071102.0047.LDC2009T13	Platform: Xbox 360, PS3, PS2, Wii
14427	LTW_ENG_20071102.0047.LDC2009T13	Release date: This week
14428	LTW_ENG_20071102.0047.LDC2009T13	Genre: Action
14429	LTW_ENG_20071102.0047.LDC2009T13	It's difficult to pick a genre for "The Simpsons Game" -- simply because, in true Simpsons fashion, it lampoons them all.
14430	LTW_ENG_20071102.0047.LDC2009T13	Indeed, ads for the game have featured fake posters for Medal of Homer (a parody of the "Medal of Honor" first-person shooter), Grand Theft Scratchy, Sitar Hero and Neverquest (a takeoff on the role- playing game "Everquest").
14431	LTW_ENG_20071102.0047.LDC2009T13	From what we've seen of the game, it stays true to the series' humor while combining a variety of gameplay styles.
14432	LTW_ENG_20071102.0047.LDC2009T13	Marge, for instance, in an effort to boycott the violent game-within-a-game Grand Theft Scratchy, has the power to use her megaphone to recruit townspeople for her angry mob -- which she can then command to destroy anyone or anything that gets in her way.
14433	LTW_ENG_20071102.0047.LDC2009T13	Ah, irony.
14434	LTW_ENG_20071102.0047.LDC2009T13	"Call Of Duty 4: Modern Warfare"
14435	LTW_ENG_20071102.0047.LDC2009T13	Platform: Xbox 360, PS3, PCs
14436	LTW_ENG_20071102.0047.LDC2009T13	Release date: Monday
14437	LTW_ENG_20071102.0047.LDC2009T13	Genre: Shooter
14438	LTW_ENG_20071102.0047.LDC2009T13	In case the title failed to make this clear, the fourth iteration in the excellent "Call of Duty" series -- unlike its predecessors -- does not take place during World War II.
14439	LTW_ENG_20071102.0047.LDC2009T13	What this means is updated weaponry and missions in locales not confined to Europe, Russia or North Africa.
14440	LTW_ENG_20071102.0047.LDC2009T13	Here you're stalking terrorists, not Nazis.
14441	LTW_ENG_20071102.0047.LDC2009T13	Fortunately, it also means a continuation of the same intense firefights the series has become known for -- in environments much richer in detail than before.
14442	LTW_ENG_20071102.0047.LDC2009T13	In addition, the game promises more of the same multi-player action the previous games delivered.
14443	LTW_ENG_20071111.0021.LDC2009T13	CONSUMER CONFIDENTIAL: Why Car Shoppers Buy Foreign
14444	LTW_ENG_20071111.0021.LDC2009T13	"It's definitely not a cool-looking car," he decided as he examined a 2008 model selling for $27,848 at a Toyota dealership .
14445	LTW_ENG_20071111.0021.LDC2009T13	"But people are talking about oil going to $100 a barrel.
14446	LTW_ENG_20071111.0021.LDC2009T13	That's just nuts."
14447	LTW_ENG_20071111.0021.LDC2009T13	I was curious to see what effect skyrocketing oil and gasoline prices were having on car buyers.
14448	LTW_ENG_20071111.0021.LDC2009T13	I also wanted to see what the view from the trenches was after General Motors Corp., the world's largest automaker, reported a $39-billion quarterly loss.
14449	LTW_ENG_20071111.0021.LDC2009T13	Hartunian, who is 35 and single, wasn't sure about the Prius' styling.
14450	LTW_ENG_20071111.0021.LDC2009T13	It's not exactly a babe magnet.
14451	LTW_ENG_20071111.0021.LDC2009T13	But Hartunian was pretty certain a Prius was the way to go, given its estimated 48 miles per gallon in city driving.
14452	LTW_ENG_20071111.0021.LDC2009T13	And he was sure of this much: He didn't want an American car.
14453	LTW_ENG_20071111.0021.LDC2009T13	"We don't make good cars," Hartunian said with a shrug.
14454	LTW_ENG_20071111.0021.LDC2009T13	There it is.
14455	LTW_ENG_20071111.0021.LDC2009T13	True or not, that's a belief shared by many U.S. drivers, and it's hammering domestic carmakers.
14456	LTW_ENG_20071111.0021.LDC2009T13	Asian brands, led by Toyota, Nissan and Honda, account for slightly more than 41 percent of the U.S. market, and that percentage is rising.
14457	LTW_ENG_20071111.0021.LDC2009T13	GM, Ford and Chrysler account for slightly more than 51 percent of the domestic market, and that percentage is falling.
14458	LTW_ENG_20071111.0021.LDC2009T13	Caroline Wilmoth, 18, drives a 2007 Toyota Scion tC, which sells for less than $20,000 and gets about 23 miles per gallon in the city.
14459	LTW_ENG_20071111.0021.LDC2009T13	She told me that when she went shopping for her first new car she didn't even consider a U.S. brand.
14460	LTW_ENG_20071111.0021.LDC2009T13	"I heard that Toyota, Nissan and Honda were the best cars you could buy," Wilmoth explained.
14461	LTW_ENG_20071111.0021.LDC2009T13	I'd like to say I found plenty of people at domestic dealerships who could refute that sentiment.
14462	LTW_ENG_20071111.0021.LDC2009T13	But that would be a lie.
14463	LTW_ENG_20071111.0021.LDC2009T13	Maybe it was the time of day (morning).
14464	LTW_ENG_20071111.0021.LDC2009T13	Maybe it was the day of the week (Thursday).
14465	LTW_ENG_20071111.0021.LDC2009T13	I don't know.
14466	LTW_ENG_20071111.0021.LDC2009T13	All I know is that when I stopped by various American-vehicle showrooms in the Pasadena, Calif., area, I couldn't find a single customer on hand to chat with.
14467	LTW_ENG_20071111.0021.LDC2009T13	Not one.
14468	LTW_ENG_20071111.0021.LDC2009T13	Nick Nielsen, the sales manager at a Buick and Pontiac dealership, made no secret of his displeasure as we chatted in his all-too-quiet workplace.
14469	LTW_ENG_20071111.0021.LDC2009T13	"The car market is terrible, if you want to know the truth," he said.
14470	LTW_ENG_20071111.0021.LDC2009T13	"Across the board."
14471	LTW_ENG_20071111.0021.LDC2009T13	At his dealership, Nielsen observed, sales were down about 40 percent from a year ago.
14472	LTW_ENG_20071111.0021.LDC2009T13	And they were down last year as well.
14473	LTW_ENG_20071111.0021.LDC2009T13	It's not that U.S. cars can't hold their own against their Japanese rivals, Nielsen insisted.
14474	LTW_ENG_20071111.0021.LDC2009T13	American cars are every bit as good as Toyotas and Nissans, he said.
14475	LTW_ENG_20071111.0021.LDC2009T13	But there's a perception in the marketplace that a Buick, say, is somehow inferior.
14476	LTW_ENG_20071111.0021.LDC2009T13	"It's hard to get rid of that perception," Nielsen said.
14477	LTW_ENG_20071111.0021.LDC2009T13	His face hardened.
14478	LTW_ENG_20071111.0021.LDC2009T13	"I personally won't buy a non-American car," Nielsen said.
14479	LTW_ENG_20071111.0021.LDC2009T13	"I'm an American.
14480	LTW_ENG_20071111.0021.LDC2009T13	You have to support your country."
14481	LTW_ENG_20071111.0021.LDC2009T13	That's a nifty bumper sticker, but it's not exactly a selling point.
14482	LTW_ENG_20071111.0021.LDC2009T13	The U.S. car market is nothing if not competitive, and consumers will look elsewhere if a particular automaker doesn't strike their fancy.
14483	LTW_ENG_20071111.0021.LDC2009T13	You have to give people what they want.
14484	LTW_ENG_20071111.0021.LDC2009T13	That's especially true as fuel prices flirt with record highs.
14485	LTW_ENG_20071111.0021.LDC2009T13	The price of a barrel of crude topped $98 on Wednesday before easing a tad.
14486	LTW_ENG_20071111.0021.LDC2009T13	Oil was trading around $96 a barrel on Friday.
14487	LTW_ENG_20071111.0021.LDC2009T13	Many analysts say oil soon will hit $100 for the first time, which will ripple throughout the economy and right into the gas pump.
14488	LTW_ENG_20071111.0021.LDC2009T13	On Friday, the Automobile Club of Southern California reported that gas prices in the region were within 20 cents of their all- time highs after climbing about 2 cents a day last week in most areas.
14489	LTW_ENG_20071111.0021.LDC2009T13	A gallon of self-serve regular was averaging $3.297 in the Los Angeles-Long Beach area.
14490	LTW_ENG_20071111.0021.LDC2009T13	That's 13.7 cents higher than a week before, 31 cents above the month-earlier level and nearly $1 more than a year ago.
14491	LTW_ENG_20071111.0021.LDC2009T13	"Crude oil prices have been breaking records since September, and that increase has hit gas pump prices in a big way this week in Southern California and throughout the U.S.," said Jeffrey Spring, an auto club spokesman.
14492	LTW_ENG_20071111.0021.LDC2009T13	With that in mind, I stopped by a Hummer dealership to get a sense of how things looked from the perspective of one of the biggest, fattest, gas-guzzlingest vehicles on the road.
14493	LTW_ENG_20071111.0021.LDC2009T13	I had the lot to myself as I wandered among the shiny, tanklike behemoths.
14494	LTW_ENG_20071111.0021.LDC2009T13	A black Hummer H2 was selling for $65,955.
14495	LTW_ENG_20071111.0021.LDC2009T13	As if it were silly to even ask, the sticker said mileage info was "not applicable to this vehicle."
14496	LTW_ENG_20071111.0021.LDC2009T13	In fact, most reviews place the GM-made H2's fuel efficiency at around 10 miles per gallon in the city.
14497	LTW_ENG_20071111.0021.LDC2009T13	I approached a salesman and asked how business had been.
14498	LTW_ENG_20071111.0021.LDC2009T13	When he learned I was from the newspaper, he clammed up and said he couldn't answer any questions.
14499	LTW_ENG_20071111.0021.LDC2009T13	I asked about who buys Hummers these days.
14500	LTW_ENG_20071111.0021.LDC2009T13	The salesman called his boss over.
14501	LTW_ENG_20071111.0021.LDC2009T13	He, too, declined to answer any questions and made it clear that my presence at the dealership wasn't welcome.
14502	LTW_ENG_20071111.0021.LDC2009T13	So I went back to the Toyota showroom, where rock music was playing and a smattering of customers were browsing among the vehicles.
14503	LTW_ENG_20071111.0021.LDC2009T13	William Stackhouse, 85, was having some maintenance done on his 2007 Prius.
14504	LTW_ENG_20071111.0021.LDC2009T13	I asked how he felt about buying American.
14505	LTW_ENG_20071111.0021.LDC2009T13	"That's a nice idea," Stackhouse replied.
14506	LTW_ENG_20071111.0021.LDC2009T13	"I just wish Detroit made cars as good as the Japanese cars."
14507	LTW_ENG_20071111.0021.LDC2009T13	So does Detroit.

14509	LTW_ENG_20071128.0003.LDC2009T13	Oaxaca After the Riots
14510	LTW_ENG_20071128.0003.LDC2009T13	The last time I was in Oaxaca, I was frantically trying to improvise a gas mask.
14511	LTW_ENG_20071128.0003.LDC2009T13	The city was a war zone: anti-government protesters packing spray paint, rocks and Molotov cocktails
14512	LTW_ENG_20071128.0003.LDC2009T13	police in riot gear tossing canisters of black tear gas into the crowd.
14513	LTW_ENG_20071128.0003.LDC2009T13	My eyes stinging, I raced past the burned-out shell of a bus.
14514	LTW_ENG_20071128.0003.LDC2009T13	Thick smoke filled the air, but there was just enough of a clearing to allow me a glimpse of El Catedral restaurant.
14515	LTW_ENG_20071128.0003.LDC2009T13	It looked so enticing: a serene courtyard, white tablecloths and glass wine goblets with the distinctive Mexican blue rim.
14516	LTW_ENG_20071128.0003.LDC2009T13	But the door was locked.
14517	LTW_ENG_20071128.0003.LDC2009T13	I kept running.
14518	LTW_ENG_20071128.0003.LDC2009T13	Fast-forward one year and I'm finally inside El Catedral, and in a city that feels much different.
14519	LTW_ENG_20071128.0003.LDC2009T13	Seated under the stars on an ancient stone patio, a fountain burbling beside me, I savor sauteed mushrooms in garlic wine sauce.
14520	LTW_ENG_20071128.0003.LDC2009T13	The setting is almost exactly as I envisioned it would be: a place of architectural jewels, one-of-a-kind textiles and culinary surprises.
14521	LTW_ENG_20071128.0003.LDC2009T13	Except I am alone.
14522	LTW_ENG_20071128.0003.LDC2009T13	The two-story bar, all polished wood and chrome, is dark.
14523	LTW_ENG_20071128.0003.LDC2009T13	The dining room to the right of the courtyard is as empty as the one to the left.
14524	LTW_ENG_20071128.0003.LDC2009T13	I have returned to Oaxaca on assignment: Find out if, one year after deadly riots crippled the city, it is again an attractive destination for visitors seeking language schools, colonial history, craft markets and art galleries.
14525	LTW_ENG_20071128.0003.LDC2009T13	I'm eager -- and a bit apprehensive -- to check in on friends I'd made here and find out whether Oaxaca still belongs on Mexico's A-list.
14526	LTW_ENG_20071128.0003.LDC2009T13	It didn't take long to realize that the answer is more complicated than I'd thought.
14527	LTW_ENG_20071128.0003.LDC2009T13	Oaxaca (wa-HA-ka) is no longer the filthy, smoldering wreck of 2006.
14528	LTW_ENG_20071128.0003.LDC2009T13	Nor, however, is it the bustling cultural center of years past.
14529	LTW_ENG_20071128.0003.LDC2009T13	It appears safe and clean.
14530	LTW_ENG_20071128.0003.LDC2009T13	But unresolved political tensions have prompted the U.S. State Department to keep it on a watch list.
14531	LTW_ENG_20071128.0003.LDC2009T13	"We're not discouraging tourism," says U.S. Embassy spokeswoman Judith Bryan.
14532	LTW_ENG_20071128.0003.LDC2009T13	"But we want informed and appropriately cautious tourism."
14533	LTW_ENG_20071128.0003.LDC2009T13	My friend Harry Smith, a Bostonian living in Oaxaca with his wife and three daughters, is keenly aware of the economic and political injustices in the city.
14534	LTW_ENG_20071128.0003.LDC2009T13	But he also wants Americans to appreciate its warmth and beauty.
14535	LTW_ENG_20071128.0003.LDC2009T13	"I would advise people to come, as long as they come with their eyes open," he says.
14536	LTW_ENG_20071128.0003.LDC2009T13	"But this is not Disneyland."
14537	LTW_ENG_20071128.0003.LDC2009T13	As in most of Oaxaca, things at El Catedral, where I've come for dinner, are "mas o menos," explains my waiter, Alberto.
14538	LTW_ENG_20071128.0003.LDC2009T13	Translated literally, the phrase means "more or less."
14539	LTW_ENG_20071128.0003.LDC2009T13	But Alberto's diplomatic shorthand, which I will hear often during a three-day visit, hints at the conflicted, contradictory state of an emotionally scarred city.
14540	LTW_ENG_20071128.0003.LDC2009T13	For adventurous travelers, "mas o menos" can also translate to opportunity.
14541	LTW_ENG_20071128.0003.LDC2009T13	The decline in foreign visitors -- from 264,000 in 2005 to 190,000 this year through October -- means there are bargains to be had and no hordes to fight.
14542	LTW_ENG_20071128.0003.LDC2009T13	Smith, for instance, negotiated half-price rates at the nearby beaches of Puerto Escondido.
14543	LTW_ENG_20071128.0003.LDC2009T13	As I finish an affordable glass of Spanish tempranillo, two groups arrive at El Catedral, adding a bit of life to the courtyard.
14544	LTW_ENG_20071128.0003.LDC2009T13	"It's certainly not like it was three years ago," declares Virginia O'Brien, a San Diegan who has returned to the city every year since her first Spanish language class in 1984.
14545	LTW_ENG_20071128.0003.LDC2009T13	"This place would be packed
14546	LTW_ENG_20071128.0003.LDC2009T13	we'd be lucky to get a table."
14547	LTW_ENG_20071128.0003.LDC2009T13	Now in her 70s, with cropped red hair and kitschy-cool Mexican- silver skeletons dangling from her ears, O'Brien loves Oaxaca so much she even came during the riots.
14548	LTW_ENG_20071128.0003.LDC2009T13	She and a travel agent friend "were going to bring a tour last year, but we canceled it, thank God," she says.
14549	LTW_ENG_20071128.0003.LDC2009T13	This year's group backed out.
14550	LTW_ENG_20071128.0003.LDC2009T13	"People are taking their kids back to school
14551	LTW_ENG_20071128.0003.LDC2009T13	they're walking in the Zocalo (town square) again," says her dining companion, Javier Garcia Vigil, who is the director of the Symphony of Oaxaca.
14552	LTW_ENG_20071128.0003.LDC2009T13	O'Brien, who loves to scout for bargain-price hand-woven rugs, remains bullish on Oaxaca.
14553	LTW_ENG_20071128.0003.LDC2009T13	But she is sad: "It hasn't staged a real comeback yet."
14554	LTW_ENG_20071128.0003.LDC2009T13	The New Normal
14555	LTW_ENG_20071128.0003.LDC2009T13	Oaxaca -- it's the name of both the capital city and the state -- is an hour's flight south of Mexico City.
14556	LTW_ENG_20071128.0003.LDC2009T13	The city (population before the riots: 258,000) was laid out by Spaniards in the mid- 1500s, and its streets are lined by mossy relics of that era.
14557	LTW_ENG_20071128.0003.LDC2009T13	The surrounding region boasts phenomenal ruins, such as the sprawling hilltop Zapotec village of Monte Alban, and what is believed to be one of the largest and best-preserved indigenous cultures in the Mesoamerican world.
14558	LTW_ENG_20071128.0003.LDC2009T13	Protest is as much a part of Oaxaca's tradition as its black clay pottery and hand-woven tapestries.
14559	LTW_ENG_20071128.0003.LDC2009T13	So when the city's teachers announced their perennial strike in May 2006, it barely caused a stir.
14560	LTW_ENG_20071128.0003.LDC2009T13	But unlike in previous years, the dispute escalated into a broader conflict over social justice.
14561	LTW_ENG_20071128.0003.LDC2009T13	Anti-government demonstrators stormed local radio stations and occupied Oaxaca's famed Zocalo.
14562	LTW_ENG_20071128.0003.LDC2009T13	The city once known for picturesque cathedrals, graceful laurel trees and colorful marketplaces was coated in graffiti and strewn with the charred remains of vehicles.
14563	LTW_ENG_20071128.0003.LDC2009T13	Some 4,000 federal police descended, erecting barricades and military-style encampments.
14564	LTW_ENG_20071128.0003.LDC2009T13	Masked protesters countered with guerrilla tactics, hurling burning tires and rocks collected from the cobblestone streets.
14565	LTW_ENG_20071128.0003.LDC2009T13	Before order was restored in December, the riots claimed the lives of at least nine and as many as 20 people, including American activist/journalist Brad Will.
14566	LTW_ENG_20071128.0003.LDC2009T13	Today, mariachi music fills the Zocalo and fresh whitewash covers the walls.
14567	LTW_ENG_20071128.0003.LDC2009T13	But marches in opposition to state Gov. Ulises Ruiz -- who sent riot police to battle demonstrators -- occur often, and residents say the underlying economic and political tensions remain.
14568	LTW_ENG_20071128.0003.LDC2009T13	Officially, Oaxaca is back to normal.
14569	LTW_ENG_20071128.0003.LDC2009T13	And as if to prove it, the government has taken a more active role in some of the city's most beloved festivals, which once had been ad-hoc community affairs.
14570	LTW_ENG_20071128.0003.LDC2009T13	But a more nuanced truth comes out when you share a coffee or a shot of mezcal with Oaxacans or with those, like my friend John Rexer, who have adopted the city.
14571	LTW_ENG_20071128.0003.LDC2009T13	"It feels antiseptic," he remarks as we walk through the Zocalo and the adjacent square known as the Alameda.
14572	LTW_ENG_20071128.0003.LDC2009T13	Rexer, an expat American, runs the Cafe No Se bar in Antigua, Guatemala.
14573	LTW_ENG_20071128.0003.LDC2009T13	But he spends much of his time in Oaxaca overseeing his latest business venture, a new brand of mezcal named Ilegal.
14574	LTW_ENG_20071128.0003.LDC2009T13	"It feels as though it's been prettied up and staged for the tourists."
14575	LTW_ENG_20071128.0003.LDC2009T13	Yes, it's nice not to be dodging flying rocks, he acknowledges.
14576	LTW_ENG_20071128.0003.LDC2009T13	But in its effort to remove the ugly barricades and trash, the government also swept away a bit of Oaxaca's soul.
14577	LTW_ENG_20071128.0003.LDC2009T13	Problems and Opportunities
14578	LTW_ENG_20071128.0003.LDC2009T13	We walk the few blocks to El Naranjo restaurant, where a decade ago, Oaxaca native Iliana de la Vega won international acclaim -- and sneers from local culinary purists -- with her lard-free mole and organic ingredients.
14579	LTW_ENG_20071128.0003.LDC2009T13	An English-speaking man in chef's whites directs us to a table next to an ancient orange tree.
14580	LTW_ENG_20071128.0003.LDC2009T13	He is friendly, helpful and definitely not de la Vega.
14581	LTW_ENG_20071128.0003.LDC2009T13	She fled Oaxaca last year, and after drifting from New Mexico to Austin, Texas, hopes to soon join the staff of the Culinary Institute of America in San Antonio.
14582	LTW_ENG_20071128.0003.LDC2009T13	"We just couldn't make it," she tells me later in a telephone interview.
14583	LTW_ENG_20071128.0003.LDC2009T13	"We had trouble getting downtown
14584	LTW_ENG_20071128.0003.LDC2009T13	we couldn't get deliveries
14585	LTW_ENG_20071128.0003.LDC2009T13	we couldn't pay the rent.
14586	LTW_ENG_20071128.0003.LDC2009T13	We'd cook all that food and then no customers would come."
14587	LTW_ENG_20071128.0003.LDC2009T13	Andrew Peterson, the new owner, proudly announces that he has changed every recipe on the menu save one: de la Vega's gazpacho.
14588	LTW_ENG_20071128.0003.LDC2009T13	In the interest of science, I order that and the mole, which had been El Naranjo's specialty.
14589	LTW_ENG_20071128.0003.LDC2009T13	Neither dish stands out, and Rexer grumbles that he has trouble detecting any chilies in his allegedly spicy shrimp.
14590	LTW_ENG_20071128.0003.LDC2009T13	Though pleasant, El Naranjo falls short: sadly gringoized, when what we crave is authenticity.
14591	LTW_ENG_20071128.0003.LDC2009T13	We amble out for a late-night stroll, pleasantly surprised to find others on the streets, a far cry from the days of curfews.
14592	LTW_ENG_20071128.0003.LDC2009T13	As we turn the corner onto Macedonio Alcala, we can't resist the lure of Caribbean music pulling us into Cafe del Borgo.
14593	LTW_ENG_20071128.0003.LDC2009T13	Behind the bar, owner Eduardo Evans looks relieved at the sight of a relatively packed house.
14594	LTW_ENG_20071128.0003.LDC2009T13	"The last four months were the worst," says Evans, better known by his nickname, Lalo.
14595	LTW_ENG_20071128.0003.LDC2009T13	With occupancy at many hotels below 10 percent, he considered leaving but couldn't: "All my money is invested here."
14596	LTW_ENG_20071128.0003.LDC2009T13	Evans predicts that the holiday season -- with Oaxaca's parades, religious ceremonies and famous radish carvings -- will be better.
14597	LTW_ENG_20071128.0003.LDC2009T13	There is one difference nowadays that is both attractive to those who complained Oaxaca had been inundated with gringos and unfortunate for the business owners who survived on U.S. dollars.
14598	LTW_ENG_20071128.0003.LDC2009T13	The majority of visitors -- including the two men seated beside me -- are Mexicans.
14599	LTW_ENG_20071128.0003.LDC2009T13	Artists in Crisis
14600	LTW_ENG_20071128.0003.LDC2009T13	Before the riots, Oaxaca had a thriving art scene, from museums with artifacts of pre-Hispanic cultures to galleries with the colorful paintings of 20th-century native Rufino Tamayo.
14601	LTW_ENG_20071128.0003.LDC2009T13	As its reputation grew, the area attracted not only painters but also sculptors, writers, musicians and filmmakers, says local artist Rowena Galavitz.
14602	LTW_ENG_20071128.0003.LDC2009T13	But last year, several galleries folded, and art students stopped coming to the city for lectures, which meant the artists, too, began abandoning Oaxaca.
14603	LTW_ENG_20071128.0003.LDC2009T13	"Anybody who was able to get out, did," she says.
14604	LTW_ENG_20071128.0003.LDC2009T13	Others, including Galavitz, began exhibiting in other cities.
14605	LTW_ENG_20071128.0003.LDC2009T13	Now, "I don't really have a market here in Oaxaca anymore."
14606	LTW_ENG_20071128.0003.LDC2009T13	Though she is aware that the political disputes could flare up again, Galavitz says the recent calm is helping to slowly revive the art world.

14610	LTW_ENG_20071216.0044.LDC2009T13	Troop Reduction to Focus on Ouylying Areas of Iraq
14611	LTW_ENG_20071216.0044.LDC2009T13	The change represents the military's first attempt to confront its big challenge in 2008: how to reduce the number of troops without sacrificing security.
14612	LTW_ENG_20071216.0044.LDC2009T13	The shift in deployment strategy, described by senior U.S. military officials in Iraq and Washington, D.C., is based on concerns that despite recent improvements, the capital could erupt again into widespread violence without an imposing American military presence.
14613	LTW_ENG_20071216.0044.LDC2009T13	A year ago, when U.S. patrols in Baghdad were sparse and sectarian killings were spiraling out of control, the troop buildup was proposed in part to establish order in the capital.
14614	LTW_ENG_20071216.0044.LDC2009T13	Over the last four months, violence in the capital has begun to abate.
14615	LTW_ENG_20071216.0044.LDC2009T13	But the most significant improvements have been in outlying areas, where the first surge troops arrived at the start of the year, followed by gradual improvements in Baghdad.
14616	LTW_ENG_20071216.0044.LDC2009T13	Planners at first thought it would be the other way around.
14617	LTW_ENG_20071216.0044.LDC2009T13	"There was a sense we would focus very significantly on Baghdad and change would come from Baghdad-out," said a senior military official in Washington, who like others spoke on condition of anonymity when discussing troop strategy.
14618	LTW_ENG_20071216.0044.LDC2009T13	"What we are seeing is just the opposite, it is probably outside-in, toward Baghdad."
14619	LTW_ENG_20071216.0044.LDC2009T13	The withdrawals are occurring over the next eight months as the troop surge that President Bush ordered last January gradually comes to an end.
14620	LTW_ENG_20071216.0044.LDC2009T13	Plans call for reducing troops that reached a peak of about 170,000 to pre-buildup levels of about 135,000.
14621	LTW_ENG_20071216.0044.LDC2009T13	The new planning is not without risk and controversy.
14622	LTW_ENG_20071216.0044.LDC2009T13	The change in U.S. deployment strategy probably will shift the balance of political power in the country by putting much greater authority over provincial affairs in the hands of local and regional officials.
14623	LTW_ENG_20071216.0044.LDC2009T13	That will increase the influence of the local and provincial governments and offset the authority of the Shiite- dominated central government.
14624	LTW_ENG_20071216.0044.LDC2009T13	In addition, some of the early troop reductions will take place in areas such as Anbar province, the site of raging insurgency in the recent past.
14625	LTW_ENG_20071216.0044.LDC2009T13	Nonetheless, the international military pullback from outlying areas is under way.
14626	LTW_ENG_20071216.0044.LDC2009T13	On Sunday, the British will hand over authority for Basra and the south to the Iraqi government.
14627	LTW_ENG_20071216.0044.LDC2009T13	Next, U.S. officers expect to hand over western provinces to Iraqi control, including Anbar, followed by still-precarious provinces north of Baghdad, say military leaders in Washington and Iraq.
14628	LTW_ENG_20071216.0044.LDC2009T13	The new U.S. military view worries officials in the Shiite- dominated central government who fear their power will be diminished.
14629	LTW_ENG_20071216.0044.LDC2009T13	The Shiite officials have expressed concern over U.S. plans to hand over security responsibilities to recently recruited police forces, particularly in Sunni strongholds such as Anbar where the new police forces are mostly Sunni.
14630	LTW_ENG_20071216.0044.LDC2009T13	But the day-to-day commander in Iraq, Army Lt. Gen. Raymond T. Odierno, and his staff believe the increasing competence of provincial security and political leaders will put pressure on the government in Baghdad that "will breed a better central government," said his chief of staff, Brig. Gen. Joseph Anderson.
14631	LTW_ENG_20071216.0044.LDC2009T13	"There are different schools of thought here," Anderson said in an interview in his office at the U.S. military headquarters at Camp Victory.
14632	LTW_ENG_20071216.0044.LDC2009T13	"Our school of thought is provincial capacity will ultimately lead to enhanced central government capacity.
14633	LTW_ENG_20071216.0044.LDC2009T13	That's our view."
14634	LTW_ENG_20071216.0044.LDC2009T13	Months ago, Bush administration officials and senior military leaders largely gave up hope of meaningful political reconciliation through Iraq's central government.
14635	LTW_ENG_20071216.0044.LDC2009T13	Instead, officials have pinned their hopes on incremental progress at the provincial level.
14636	LTW_ENG_20071216.0044.LDC2009T13	As a consequence, Odierno's plan enjoys broad support.
14637	LTW_ENG_20071216.0044.LDC2009T13	"The grass-roots level will force change at the top because if they do not act on it, they will get overrun," said another senior military officer responsible for Iraq war planning.
14638	LTW_ENG_20071216.0044.LDC2009T13	So far, military officials have sought to design the troop reduction in a way that avoids creation of security gaps.But by the spring, when the number of U.S. brigades in Iraq is reduced from the current 19 to 17, significant turnovers of security responsibility in outlying provinces are inevitable, Odierno said in an interview.
14639	LTW_ENG_20071216.0044.LDC2009T13	Those turnovers should accelerate the shift away from a pure counterinsurgency strategy.
14640	LTW_ENG_20071216.0044.LDC2009T13	Military leaders in Washington have been pressing generals in Baghdad to move toward what they call "tactical overwatch."
14641	LTW_ENG_20071216.0044.LDC2009T13	Under that strategy, Iraqi troops would take the lead in most operations, and U.S. troops would be called in only when problems occur.
14642	LTW_ENG_20071216.0044.LDC2009T13	A faster move toward an "overwatch" strategy has gained adherents as U.S. officials try to draw lessons from the experience of the British in Basra, the largest city in the south, which will become the first sector of the country outside the semi- autonomous Kurdistan enclave in the north to be handed over to the Iraqi government and security forces.
14643	LTW_ENG_20071216.0044.LDC2009T13	"You cannot set zero violence as your standard in Iraq.
14644	LTW_ENG_20071216.0044.LDC2009T13	It is just not attainable," the senior military official in Washington, D.C., said.
14645	LTW_ENG_20071216.0044.LDC2009T13	"The standard rather is a level of violence that is containable by the Iraqi security forces.
14646	LTW_ENG_20071216.0044.LDC2009T13	And that is largely what we have seen in Basra."
14647	LTW_ENG_20071216.0044.LDC2009T13	For the Americans, the first real test of how well security can hold up as the drawdown intensifies this spring probably will take place in the north.
14648	LTW_ENG_20071216.0044.LDC2009T13	Significant violence still plagues Diyala province and its provincial capital, Baqubah.
14649	LTW_ENG_20071216.0044.LDC2009T13	Military planners are grappling with a solution to deal with the instability in the region.
14650	LTW_ENG_20071216.0044.LDC2009T13	Some senior commanders believe violence in the northern provinces are the result of a spillover of Sunni radicals linked to al- Qaida in Iraq who have fled their former stronghold of Anbar, where a U.S.-Iraqi alliance has all but shut down their operations.
14651	LTW_ENG_20071216.0044.LDC2009T13	Under such an analysis, additional combat operations might be needed.
14652	LTW_ENG_20071216.0044.LDC2009T13	But at least one aide to Odierno, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the violence appears more likely to be tied to ongoing sectarian disputes in the region over the eventual boundaries of the Kurdistan region.
14653	LTW_ENG_20071216.0044.LDC2009T13	Such disputes need to be resolved through sectarian reconciliation and not military action, the aide said.
14654	LTW_ENG_20071216.0044.LDC2009T13	U.S. military officials insisted the focus on Baghdad is not indicative of a lack of success in the capital.
14655	LTW_ENG_20071216.0044.LDC2009T13	Violence is down significantly, they note, and services are being restored.
14656	LTW_ENG_20071216.0044.LDC2009T13	But American generals also acknowledged that sectarian tensions still plague the capital.
14657	LTW_ENG_20071216.0044.LDC2009T13	For example, public services provided by the central government are aimed largely at Shiite neighborhoods at the expense of Sunni areas.
14658	LTW_ENG_20071216.0044.LDC2009T13	In addition, the multiethnic makeup of the capital makes it the most difficult part of the country to achieve reconciliation between once- warring factions.
14659	LTW_ENG_20071216.0044.LDC2009T13	Army Brig. Gen. Vincent Brooks, assistant commander for the military headquarters responsible for Baghdad, said the Iraqi central government is less willing to take a risk in the capital, worried that a dramatic reduction in the U.S. forces could quickly reignite security problems.
14660	LTW_ENG_20071216.0044.LDC2009T13	"Baghdad will be last," Brooks said, "because it's the capital and because it's the most complex."

14716	LTW_ENG_20080111.0123.LDC2009T13	Gulf Threat May Not Have Come from Iranians, Pentagon Says
14717	LTW_ENG_20080111.0123.LDC2009T13	The Pentagon said Thursday that the radio threat to bomb U.S. warships in the Persian Gulf last weekend may not have come from the five Iranian Revolutionary Guard speedboats that approached them -- and may not even have been intended against U.S. targets.
14718	LTW_ENG_20080111.0123.LDC2009T13	The communication Sunday was made on radio channel 16, a common marine frequency used by ships and others in the region.
14719	LTW_ENG_20080111.0123.LDC2009T13	"It could have been a threat aimed at some other nation or a myriad of other things," said Rear Adm. Frank Thorp IV, a spokesman for the Navy.
14720	LTW_ENG_20080111.0123.LDC2009T13	In the radio message recorded by the Navy, a heavily accented voice said, "I am coming to you.
14721	LTW_ENG_20080111.0123.LDC2009T13	You will explode after a few minutes."
14722	LTW_ENG_20080111.0123.LDC2009T13	But Farsi speakers and Iranians told The Washington Post that the accent did not sound Iranian.
14723	LTW_ENG_20080111.0123.LDC2009T13	In part because of the threatening language, the United States has elevated the encounter into an international incident.
14724	LTW_ENG_20080111.0123.LDC2009T13	Twice this week, President Bush criticized Iran's behavior as provocative and warned of "serious consequences" if it happens again.
14725	LTW_ENG_20080111.0123.LDC2009T13	He is due to head Friday to the Gulf, where containing Iran is expected to be a major theme of his talks in five oil- rich sheikdoms.
14726	LTW_ENG_20080111.0123.LDC2009T13	Pentagon officials insist that they never claimed Iran made the threat.
14727	LTW_ENG_20080111.0123.LDC2009T13	"No one in the military has said that the transmission emanated from those boats.
14728	LTW_ENG_20080111.0123.LDC2009T13	But when they hear it simultaneously to the behavior of those boats, it only adds to the tension," said Pentagon spokesman Geoff Morrell.
14729	LTW_ENG_20080111.0123.LDC2009T13	"If this verbal threat emanated from something or someone unrelated to the five boats, it would not lessen the threat from those boats."
14730	LTW_ENG_20080111.0123.LDC2009T13	The warning was picked up on a bridge-to-bridge communication received by many ships in the region some seven minutes after the five Iranian patrol boats first appeared on the horizon, Thorp said.
14731	LTW_ENG_20080111.0123.LDC2009T13	The main threat, Pentagon officials said, was the way the five patrol boats swarmed erratically around the USS Port Royal, an Aegis cruiser, and an accompanying frigate and destroyer, and then dropped small white box-like items in the water.
14732	LTW_ENG_20080111.0123.LDC2009T13	"When you get a bridge-to-bridge call you have no way of knowing where it came from," Thorp said.
14733	LTW_ENG_20080111.0123.LDC2009T13	"Nobody ever with any certainty knew it was from them.
14734	LTW_ENG_20080111.0123.LDC2009T13	But it did escalate it up a notch as it was happening at the same time" that the patrol boats manned by Revolutionary Guards engaged in menacing behavior, Thorp said.
14735	LTW_ENG_20080111.0123.LDC2009T13	Yet the Pentagon has consistently given the impression that the threat was linked to the Iranian boats.
14736	LTW_ENG_20080111.0123.LDC2009T13	"This is more serious because of the aggregate of the actions, the coordinated movement of the ships, the boats, the aggressive maneuvering, the more or less simultaneous radio communication, the dropping of objects ... So yes, it's more serious than we have seen," Vice Admiral Kevin Cosgriff, commander of U.S. Naval Forces Central Command, said at a new briefing Monday.
14737	LTW_ENG_20080111.0123.LDC2009T13	The Pentagon's audio tape of the warning was also released Tuesday with the video tape in an abridged four-minute package of the incident, which U.S. officials said lasted between 20 and 30 minutes.
14738	LTW_ENG_20080111.0123.LDC2009T13	The U.S. ships were within seconds of opening fire on the five Iranian speedboats when they turned and headed toward Iran, Pentagon officials said.
14739	LTW_ENG_20080111.0123.LDC2009T13	The radio threat was merely a "sideshow" to the physical threat, a senior U.S. official familiar with the incident said.
14740	LTW_ENG_20080111.0123.LDC2009T13	"What was the command and control mechanism here?
14741	LTW_ENG_20080111.0123.LDC2009T13	Was Tehran aware of what they were doing?
14742	LTW_ENG_20080111.0123.LDC2009T13	They made these provocative moves.
14743	LTW_ENG_20080111.0123.LDC2009T13	The radio was a sideshow to the event," he said.
14744	LTW_ENG_20080111.0123.LDC2009T13	To further challenge the U.S. version, Iran Thursday released what it claimed was an abridged video of the same incident, which shows a calm exchange.
14745	LTW_ENG_20080111.0123.LDC2009T13	"Slowly get a little closer ... can't make out the ship number," says a Revolutionary Guardsman on a small Iranian patrol boat, speaking in Farsi.
14746	LTW_ENG_20080111.0123.LDC2009T13	"I hear something being announced from its loudspeakers, what is it saying?
14747	LTW_ENG_20080111.0123.LDC2009T13	I think they're talking to us."
14748	LTW_ENG_20080111.0123.LDC2009T13	"Which channel?"
14749	LTW_ENG_20080111.0123.LDC2009T13	says a second Iranian.
14750	LTW_ENG_20080111.0123.LDC2009T13	"Coalition warship 73," he says, speaking in English through his radio mike.
14751	LTW_ENG_20080111.0123.LDC2009T13	"This Iranian navy patrol boat.
14752	LTW_ENG_20080111.0123.LDC2009T13	Request side number ... operating in the area this time."
14753	LTW_ENG_20080111.0123.LDC2009T13	An American ship radios back.
14754	LTW_ENG_20080111.0123.LDC2009T13	"This is coalition warship 73.
14755	LTW_ENG_20080111.0123.LDC2009T13	I read you loud and clear."
14756	LTW_ENG_20080111.0123.LDC2009T13	The five-minute video, released Thursday by Iranian television, offers no indication of the tensions that supposedly sparked the weekend encounter between U.S. and Iranian vessels in the Strait of Hormuz -- and no intention of an attack.
14757	LTW_ENG_20080111.0123.LDC2009T13	The Pentagon said it does not dispute anything in the Iranian video.
14758	LTW_ENG_20080111.0123.LDC2009T13	In Tehran, Revolutionary Guards Brig. General Ali Fadavi charged that the United States was creating a "media fuss," the Fars News Agency reported.
14759	LTW_ENG_20080111.0123.LDC2009T13	He said the Iranian goal was to obtain registration numbers that had been unreadable.
14760	LTW_ENG_20080111.0123.LDC2009T13	The U.S. presence in the Gulf's international waters is a sensitive issue in Iran because the USS Vincennes, another Aegis cruiser, in 1988 shot down an Iranian passenger plane, killing all 290 on board.
14761	LTW_ENG_20080111.0123.LDC2009T13	The United States at first claimed it was a warplane and then said that it was outside the civilian air corridor and did not respond to radio calls.
14762	LTW_ENG_20080111.0123.LDC2009T13	Both were untrue, and the radio calls were made on a military frequencies that the airliner did not have.
14763	LTW_ENG_20080111.0123.LDC2009T13	A subsequent investigation showed the U.S. ship was off course.
14764	LTW_ENG_20080111.0123.LDC2009T13	Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman said the new Iranian video does not refute the U.S. version.
14765	LTW_ENG_20080111.0123.LDC2009T13	"Simply choosing not to reveal the careless and reckless actions in this video does not change the facts from what took place," he said in an e-mail.
14766	LTW_ENG_20080111.0123.LDC2009T13	The United States Thursday sent an official protest to Tehran through Switzerland, while Defense Secretary Robert Gates charged that Iran had acted aggressively.
14767	LTW_ENG_20080111.0123.LDC2009T13	"What concerned us was first the fact that there were five of these boats and, second, that they came as close as they did to our ships and behaved in a pretty aggressive manner," he told a press conference.
14768	LTW_ENG_20080111.0123.LDC2009T13	Citing former Defense Secretary William Cohen, Gates said, "Are you going to believe me or your lying eyes?
14769	LTW_ENG_20080111.0123.LDC2009T13	I think that aptly characterizes and appropriately characterizes, the Iranian claim."

14771	LTW_ENG_20080117.0053.LDC2009T13	Judge Doubles O.J. Simpson's Bail
14772	LTW_ENG_20080117.0053.LDC2009T13	An angry District Judge Jackie Glass set bail at $250,000.
14773	LTW_ENG_20080117.0053.LDC2009T13	Simpson was returned to jail here from his home in Florida last week after the Clark County district attorney's office said Simpson had violated the conditions of his bail by attempting to contact co-defendant Clarence "C.J." Stewart .
14774	LTW_ENG_20080117.0053.LDC2009T13	District Attorney David Roger said Simpson, in a telephone call, asked his bail bondsman, Miguel Pereira, to tell Stewart how upset he was about Stewart's testimony during their preliminary hearing.
14775	LTW_ENG_20080117.0053.LDC2009T13	Glass said she couldn't understand why Simpson had made the telephone call, but warned him that she would tolerate no such behavior.
14776	LTW_ENG_20080117.0053.LDC2009T13	"If you violate those rules and anything happens like this in the future, you'll be back and locked up in the Clark County Detention Center," she warned Simpson.
14777	LTW_ENG_20080117.0053.LDC2009T13	"I don't know, Mr. Simpson, what the heck you were thinking, or maybe that's the problem -- you weren't," Glass said.
14778	LTW_ENG_20080117.0053.LDC2009T13	"I don't know if it's just arrogance.
14779	LTW_ENG_20080117.0053.LDC2009T13	I don't know if it's ignorance.
14780	LTW_ENG_20080117.0053.LDC2009T13	But you've been locked up at the Clark County Detention Center since Friday because of arrogance or ignorance or both."
14781	LTW_ENG_20080117.0053.LDC2009T13	Simpson was expected to post the new bond, said his lawyer, Yale Galanter, though the exact time was unknown.
14782	LTW_ENG_20080117.0053.LDC2009T13	Earlier, a shackled Simpson wearing blue jail togs was brought into the courtroom to appear before Glass.
14783	LTW_ENG_20080117.0053.LDC2009T13	In September, Simpson, 60, and several others were charged with entering a hotel room and taking sports memorabilia at gunpoint.
14784	LTW_ENG_20080117.0053.LDC2009T13	Simpson has denied knowing that guns would be involved and has insisted he was just recovering items originally stolen from him by an agent.
14785	LTW_ENG_20080117.0053.LDC2009T13	Simpson pleaded not guilty Nov. 28 to kidnapping, armed robbery, assault with a deadly weapon, burglary, coercion and conspiracy charges in the incident.
14786	LTW_ENG_20080117.0053.LDC2009T13	Three former co-defendants have pleaded to lesser charges and testified against Simpson at the preliminary hearing.
14787	LTW_ENG_20080117.0053.LDC2009T13	The trial is scheduled to begin in April.
14788	LTW_ENG_20080117.0053.LDC2009T13	Justice of the Peace Joe M. Bonaventure, who set the original bail on Sept. 19, was insistent that Simpson not have any contact with anyone involved in the case.
14789	LTW_ENG_20080117.0053.LDC2009T13	The prosecutor alleges that Simpson detailed in a Nov. 16 telephone message what he wanted Pereira to tell Stewart: "I just want, want C.J. to know that ... I'm tired of this (expletive).
14790	LTW_ENG_20080117.0053.LDC2009T13	Fed up with (expletives) changing what they told me.
14791	LTW_ENG_20080117.0053.LDC2009T13	All right?"
14792	LTW_ENG_20080117.0053.LDC2009T13	Simpson, in court papers, denied violating the original conditions of the bail.
14793	LTW_ENG_20080117.0053.LDC2009T13	Pereira was the only witness in the proceeding, which lasted less than 30 minutes.
14794	LTW_ENG_20080117.0053.LDC2009T13	Times staff writers Powers reported from Las Vegas and Muskal from Los Angeles.
14795	LTW_ENG_20080125.0140.LDC2009T13	Junior Trader Cost French Bank $7 Billion
14796	LTW_ENG_20080125.0140.LDC2009T13	The alleged fraud by Jerome Kerviel, 31, staggered Societe Generale, France's second-largest bank.
14797	LTW_ENG_20080125.0140.LDC2009T13	Its disclosure delivered a new blow to a European banking industry already reeling from losses on American subprime mortgage securities -- including a $3 billion writedown announced Thursday by Societe Generale itself.
14798	LTW_ENG_20080125.0140.LDC2009T13	"With everybody already quite scared about financial stocks, this creates even more of a threat to this sector," said Olivier de la Ferriere, a financial analyst at Richelieu Finance in Paris.
14799	LTW_ENG_20080125.0140.LDC2009T13	"There is a real confidence crisis anyway ... this does not help."
14800	LTW_ENG_20080125.0140.LDC2009T13	And it raised the possibility that the bank, in its haste to unwind Kerviel's bad bets, may have exacerbated a European stock- market plunge earlier this week.
14801	LTW_ENG_20080125.0140.LDC2009T13	That decline, in turn, was at least partially responsible for the Federal Reserve's extraordinary 3/4-point rate cut on Tuesday.
14802	LTW_ENG_20080125.0140.LDC2009T13	Societe Generale's chairman, Daniel Bouton, said in a letter to shareholders that immediately after discovering the scale of the fraud on Jan. 19, he decided to liquidate Kerviel's futures positions "in all urgency to avoid even worse consequences, given (their) size."
14803	LTW_ENG_20080125.0140.LDC2009T13	During a conference call Thursday in Paris, bank officials said that they completed unwinding all the transactions from Monday through Wednesday before publicly disclosing the fraud.
14804	LTW_ENG_20080125.0140.LDC2009T13	They said the bank suffered an "enormous loss" because of unfavorable market conditions.
14805	LTW_ENG_20080125.0140.LDC2009T13	The actual timing and nature of Societe Generale's sales were unclear, however, as was its impact on European exchanges.
14806	LTW_ENG_20080125.0140.LDC2009T13	Those markets plummeted by more than 5 percent on Monday on the heels of a steep sell off in Asian markets.
14807	LTW_ENG_20080125.0140.LDC2009T13	The Fed announced its rate cut early the following morning.
14808	LTW_ENG_20080125.0140.LDC2009T13	A Fed official said the central bank was unaware of the Societe Generale situation when it implemented the rate cut, according to Reuters and, in any event, the Fed maintained Tuesday that it took the step in response to "a weakening of the economic outlook" and to deteriorating financial markets.
14809	LTW_ENG_20080125.0140.LDC2009T13	Societe Generale's loss swamps the previous high-water mark for activity by a rogue trader -- that set by Nicholas Leeson, who lost $1.3 billion in Asian futures and other derivatives at Barings Bank in 1995.
14810	LTW_ENG_20080125.0140.LDC2009T13	That loss bankrupted the 233-year-old British bank, which subsequently was taken over by the Dutch financial firm ING.
14811	LTW_ENG_20080125.0140.LDC2009T13	Bank officials and securities analysts said it was unlikely that the new scandal would have the same impact on Societe General, which was founded in 1864 and currently has 120,000 employees in 77 countries.
14812	LTW_ENG_20080125.0140.LDC2009T13	It is the owner of Los Angeles-based TCW Group, the parent of Trust Company of the West, which manages $153 billion for clients.
14813	LTW_ENG_20080125.0140.LDC2009T13	A TCW spokesman said the trust company was "in no way directly or indirectly related to any of the losses announced today by Societe Generale."
14814	LTW_ENG_20080125.0140.LDC2009T13	"This is a very big bank," said Ruth Lea, economic adviser and director at Arbuthnot Banking Group in London.
14815	LTW_ENG_20080125.0140.LDC2009T13	"It's not as if it's unenviable.
14816	LTW_ENG_20080125.0140.LDC2009T13	I'd be very surprised if it didn't see its way through this."
14817	LTW_ENG_20080125.0140.LDC2009T13	French politicians took pains to paint the case as one without implications beyond the management and regulation of Societe Generale.
14818	LTW_ENG_20080125.0140.LDC2009T13	French Prime Minister Francois Fillon called the fraud "a serious matter," but said "it has nothing to do with the current situation on the global financial markets."
14819	LTW_ENG_20080125.0140.LDC2009T13	Bouton announced Thursday that the bank would show a profit of $875 million to $1.1 billion for 2007, a sharp decline from $7.6-billion profit in 2006.
14820	LTW_ENG_20080125.0140.LDC2009T13	He said he had offered to resign after the disclosure of the trading fraud, but the bank's board had rejected the overture.
14821	LTW_ENG_20080125.0140.LDC2009T13	Still, the bank said that it would raise $3 billion in capital through an emergency stock sale that was already underwritten by a consortium of banks.
14822	LTW_ENG_20080125.0140.LDC2009T13	The capital increase was made necessary by the trading loss as well as by the writedowns from its exposure to U.S. credit securities, Bouton said.
14823	LTW_ENG_20080125.0140.LDC2009T13	Although Lea and other analysts speculated that the loss might make Societe Generale more vulnerable to a takeover, Bouton turned away questions about that possibility.
14824	LTW_ENG_20080125.0140.LDC2009T13	In trading Thursday on the Paris Bourse, Societe Generale lost 4.4 percent of its value while the CAC 40 index of Paris stocks gained 6.1 percent.
14825	LTW_ENG_20080125.0140.LDC2009T13	Kerviel -- whom Societe Generale executives did not name but who was identified in news reports from Europe -- began working at the bank's back office in 2000, when he was assigned to help fashion the internal programs that placed transaction limits on individual traders.
14826	LTW_ENG_20080125.0140.LDC2009T13	In 2005, he was moved to a trading desk, where bank officials said he was given only limited authority to hedge the bank's trading positions in European stocks with stock index futures.
14827	LTW_ENG_20080125.0140.LDC2009T13	This involves making countervailing bets on the future performance of stocks as an insurance policy against adverse moves in the bank's stock portfolio.
14828	LTW_ENG_20080125.0140.LDC2009T13	His salary was pegged at 100,000 euros, or about $146,000 a year, including bonus
14829	LTW_ENG_20080125.0140.LDC2009T13	the bank said his trades were expected to generate a modest $20 million in revenue a year.
14830	LTW_ENG_20080125.0140.LDC2009T13	Instead, Kerviel regularly exceeded his trading limits without detection, starting as early as 2006.
14831	LTW_ENG_20080125.0140.LDC2009T13	Using the knowledge he had gained in the back office, he concealed his actions by fabricating balancing trades -- using "extremely sophisticated and varied techniques," as Bouton said in his letter to shareholders.
14832	LTW_ENG_20080125.0140.LDC2009T13	At least for a portion of 2007 his trading was profitable
14833	LTW_ENG_20080125.0140.LDC2009T13	just before the start of the new year, however, he undertook a huge bet that European stock markets would rise in January.
14834	LTW_ENG_20080125.0140.LDC2009T13	Instead, they fell sharply, losing nearly 10 percent through last Friday.
14835	LTW_ENG_20080125.0140.LDC2009T13	The following day, Societe Generale officials confronted Kerviel with evidence of his unauthorized trading.
14836	LTW_ENG_20080125.0140.LDC2009T13	He immediately confessed and was fired, but spent the weekend helping superiors create a liquidation strategy.
14837	LTW_ENG_20080125.0140.LDC2009T13	The bank said it had filed legal charges against Kerviel and that "four or five" officers responsible for financial surveillance had also lost their jobs.
14838	LTW_ENG_20080125.0140.LDC2009T13	But executives said they believed they had discovered the full extent of the unauthorized trading.
14839	LTW_ENG_20080125.0140.LDC2009T13	Bank executives said that they could not explain the trader's motivation, beyond the possibility that he was trying to show that the bank's financial control procedures could be defeated.
14840	LTW_ENG_20080125.0140.LDC2009T13	There was no evidence that he personally profited from his scheme.
14841	LTW_ENG_20080125.0140.LDC2009T13	They had not yet determined whether Kerviel had accomplices inside or outside the bank.
14842	LTW_ENG_20080125.0140.LDC2009T13	Baum reported from Paris and Hiltzik from Los Angeles.
14843	LTW_ENG_20080214.0118.LDC2009T13	Australian Diabetes Study Contradicts U.S. Findings
14844	LTW_ENG_20080214.0118.LDC2009T13	Physicians and patients were shocked by last week's announcement because it seemed to contradict a long-held tenet of diabetes treatment -- that reducing blood glucose levels as much as possible improves patient health.
14845	LTW_ENG_20080214.0118.LDC2009T13	The new study, with nearly twice as much data as the American one and a longer follow-up time, provides some reassurance that the paradigm has not been overturned.
14846	LTW_ENG_20080214.0118.LDC2009T13	But there are enough differences between the two studies to cloud the source of the discrepancy, experts said.
14847	LTW_ENG_20080214.0118.LDC2009T13	Doctors had already warned diabetics not to alter their treatment regimens, and the new findings from the George Institute for International Health in Sydney reinforced that warning.
14848	LTW_ENG_20080214.0118.LDC2009T13	"I think the message is, `Don't do anything until we get this sorted out,' " said Richard Kahn, chief scientific and medical officer of the American Diabetes Association.
14849	LTW_ENG_20080214.0118.LDC2009T13	The American trial, known as ACCORD, focused on 10,251 patients in the U.S. and Canada with Type 2 diabetes who either had heart disease or were at high risk of developing it.
14850	LTW_ENG_20080214.0118.LDC2009T13	About 65 percent of the 284,000 deaths linked to diabetes each year are caused by heart disease.
14851	LTW_ENG_20080214.0118.LDC2009T13	In the two arms of the trial, physicians used various combinations of lifestyle changes and drugs to reduce blood glucose levels -- as measured by concentrations of glycated hemoblobin, or A1C -- to either 6 percent or to between 7 percent and 7.5 percent.
14852	LTW_ENG_20080214.0118.LDC2009T13	Healthy individuals have an A1C level of about 6 percent, while normal treatment regimens achieve levels of 7 percent to 7.5 percent.
14853	LTW_ENG_20080214.0118.LDC2009T13	In a news conference Feb. 6, the ACCORD team said it was abandoning the intensive-treatment arm of the study because a preliminary analysis showed an excess of deaths in that group -- 257 compared to 203 in the standard-treatment group.
14854	LTW_ENG_20080214.0118.LDC2009T13	In light of that announcement, Dr. Stephen MacMahon of the George Institute asked the data monitoring and safety committee for his own study, called ADVANCE, to look for excess deaths among its participants.
14855	LTW_ENG_20080214.0118.LDC2009T13	The ADVANCE study enrolled 11,140 high-risk patients in Europe, Asia, Australia and Canada and had treatment goals similar to that of the ACCORD trial.
14856	LTW_ENG_20080214.0118.LDC2009T13	"The interim results from ADVANCE provide no confirmation of the adverse mortality trend reported from the ACCORD study," Dr. Rory Collins of the University of Oxford in England, chairman of the data monitoring committee, said in an e-mailed statement.
14857	LTW_ENG_20080214.0118.LDC2009T13	He also noted that the interim results were based on twice as much data and similar levels of glucose control as the ACCORD study.
14858	LTW_ENG_20080214.0118.LDC2009T13	No other results from the study were released.
14859	LTW_ENG_20080214.0118.LDC2009T13	A final report is expected later this year, along with results from a third trial that is also underway.
14860	LTW_ENG_20080214.0118.LDC2009T13	Experts were at a loss to explain the difference between the two studies.
14861	LTW_ENG_20080214.0118.LDC2009T13	One possibility is that the Americans in the trial were heavier, and thus at higher risk of death from heart disease.
14862	LTW_ENG_20080214.0118.LDC2009T13	The patients in the ACCORD trial also received a drug that is not available in the United States.
14863	LTW_ENG_20080214.0118.LDC2009T13	Physicians said they hope that publication of all three reports will enable them to resolve the discrepancies.

14865	LTW_ENG_20080305.0177.LDC2009T13	(c) 2008, Newsday
14866	LTW_ENG_20080305.0177.LDC2009T13	COLUMBUS, Ohio -- Hillary Rodham Clinton sidestepped political disaster Tuesday night, winning the Ohio primary and remaining neck-and-neck with Barack Obama in a Texas primary that was still too close to call late Tuesday night, at least the caucus count.
14867	LTW_ENG_20080305.0177.LDC2009T13	Clinton's victories in Ohio and Rhode Island marked the latest twist in a wildly unpredictable primary season -- and snapped a 12-state, 29-day losing streak.
14868	LTW_ENG_20080305.0177.LDC2009T13	The victories gave her campaign much needed momentum, even though they will do relatively little to cut into Obama's 100-plus delegate lead.
14869	LTW_ENG_20080305.0177.LDC2009T13	"For every one who has ever been counted out but refused to be knocked out, for every one who has stumbled but has stood right back up this one's for you!"
14870	LTW_ENG_20080305.0177.LDC2009T13	a jubilant Clinton as supporters showed "Yes we can!"
14871	LTW_ENG_20080305.0177.LDC2009T13	in a Columbus ballroom.
14872	LTW_ENG_20080305.0177.LDC2009T13	"As Ohio goes, so goes the nation," she added.
14873	LTW_ENG_20080305.0177.LDC2009T13	"We're going on, we're going strong and we're going all the way."
14874	LTW_ENG_20080305.0177.LDC2009T13	The former first lady led Obama by 57 percent to 41 percent with 63 percent of the precincts reporting at 11:15 p.m. Clinton held a 50 percent to 49 percent lead in Texas with 39 percent of precincts reporting.
14875	LTW_ENG_20080305.0177.LDC2009T13	Clinton, who enjoyed comfortable leads in both states as recently as two weeks ago, also cut into Barack Obama's growing lead in delegates.
14876	LTW_ENG_20080305.0177.LDC2009T13	And earlier in the evening she broke her 29-day, 11-contest losing streak by winning the Rhode Island primary.
14877	LTW_ENG_20080305.0177.LDC2009T13	But Obama, who has enjoyed one of the great hot streaks in modern political history, matched her, breezing to a two-to-one win in Vermont.
14878	LTW_ENG_20080305.0177.LDC2009T13	Despite the loss, Obama advisers declared he'd win the nomination, claiming that the likelihood of her erasing his 100-plus lead in delegates is now nearly impossible with only 12 contests remaining.
14879	LTW_ENG_20080305.0177.LDC2009T13	The polls showed late-deciding voters in both states breaking strongly for Clinton, reversing recent trends -- and possibly indicating that Clinton's attacks on Obama's national security record and his positions on NAFTA are taking hold.
14880	LTW_ENG_20080305.0177.LDC2009T13	Clinton lost most regions of Ohio to Obama but she dominated in the heavily industrialized northeast, an area of white, blue- collar, heavily Catholic towns and cities.
14881	LTW_ENG_20080305.0177.LDC2009T13	Advisers to Clinton said nothing in Tuesday's returns would cause her to reconsider her campaign.
14882	LTW_ENG_20080305.0177.LDC2009T13	One described her as "hell-bent" to fight on through the April 22 Pennsylvania primary regardless of the outcome in Texas.
14883	LTW_ENG_20080305.0177.LDC2009T13	"It's a long road to the nomination and I feel really good right now," she told reporters during an early morning stop at a polling station in an Hispanic section of Houston.
14884	LTW_ENG_20080305.0177.LDC2009T13	"This is one of the most civil and positive primary campaigns I can remember."
14885	LTW_ENG_20080305.0177.LDC2009T13	Clinton is planning rallies in Philadelphia and possibly Pittsburgh Thursday, according to sources in her campaign.
14886	LTW_ENG_20080305.0177.LDC2009T13	Sleet and freezing rain in northern Ohio prompted a judge to order 15 predominantly black precincts around Cleveland to stay open for an additional 90 minutes.
14887	LTW_ENG_20080305.0177.LDC2009T13	Clinton aides saw the move as helping Obama, who was winning the state's African-American vote by 85 percent to 15 percent, according to exit polls.
14888	LTW_ENG_20080305.0177.LDC2009T13	Voting in Texas, which has a complicated primary-caucus hybrid system, went smoothly at first amid huge turnout.
14889	LTW_ENG_20080305.0177.LDC2009T13	But the caucuses, which used to select 35 percent of the state's delegates, were marred by delays and late Tuesday the Clinton campaign accused Obama workers of illegally pre-registering caucus-goers in eight precincts.
14890	LTW_ENG_20080305.0177.LDC2009T13	An upbeat Clinton began a day of campaigning in Texas, where she courted Hispanic voters in Houston and at a Mexican restaurant in Dallas.
14891	LTW_ENG_20080305.0177.LDC2009T13	Exit polls showed her with a two-to-one advantage among Lone Star State Hispanics -- although Obama bested her among Latinos age 18 to 29.
14892	LTW_ENG_20080305.0177.LDC2009T13	For a third straight day, a combative Clinton rebuffed calls by Obama supporters and some party elders to pledge to drop out of the race if she failed to scored decisive wins Tuesday.
14893	LTW_ENG_20080305.0177.LDC2009T13	She was buoyed by an ABC News poll showing that Americans supported her remaining in the race by a two-to-one vote, provided she won either Texas or Ohio.
14894	LTW_ENG_20080305.0177.LDC2009T13	"Never underestimate the intelligence of the voters," she said.
14895	LTW_ENG_20080316.0026.LDC2009T13	A Novel Take on Spitzer
14896	LTW_ENG_20080316.0026.LDC2009T13	perversely they thought -- that unrelenting virtue is not just unrealistic but uninteresting.
14897	LTW_ENG_20080316.0026.LDC2009T13	Gatsby, I reminded them, is a damned fool who falls in love with a woman unworthy of his affection.
14898	LTW_ENG_20080316.0026.LDC2009T13	Because he's blind, he does everything wrong, and we sympathize because we, too, have been blind and done things wrong.
14899	LTW_ENG_20080316.0026.LDC2009T13	Granted, Huck Finn is an innocent, uncorrupted (as yet) by a depraved world, but he's never more interesting than when he's convinced of his own depravity.
14900	LTW_ENG_20080316.0026.LDC2009T13	We like him right from the start, but when he says, "OK, I'll go to hell" -- that's when we fall in love.
14901	LTW_ENG_20080316.0026.LDC2009T13	For most people, mine is a losing argument, and one night recently, as I stayed up watching television coverage of Eliot Spitzer's disgrace, I found myself losing it all over again as the media turned a complex drama into a simple story line: Now that he's no longer their unsullied white knight, Spitzer must be a complete hypocrite.
14902	LTW_ENG_20080316.0026.LDC2009T13	Later, I lay awake in the dark thinking about how a novel about Eliot Spitzer might go and what kind of novel it would be.
14903	LTW_ENG_20080316.0026.LDC2009T13	My fictional Eliot would be complex, would contain paradoxes.
14904	LTW_ENG_20080316.0026.LDC2009T13	He would not be a hypocrite.
14905	LTW_ENG_20080316.0026.LDC2009T13	My Eliot would believe with his whole heart in his crusades against the corrupt and the powerful and the privileged, even as he worked studiously to undermine his legacy.
14906	LTW_ENG_20080316.0026.LDC2009T13	Fiction can accommodate such paradoxes, provided they're explained.
14907	LTW_ENG_20080316.0026.LDC2009T13	But I don't mean to jigger the facts
14908	LTW_ENG_20080316.0026.LDC2009T13	fictive Eliot will do exactly what the real Eliot has done, only my guy almost never imagines getting caught.
14909	LTW_ENG_20080316.0026.LDC2009T13	And when he does occasionally consider the possibility, he trusts that there will be ample warning that disaster is imminent.
14910	LTW_ENG_20080316.0026.LDC2009T13	For the most part, things in his life have happened slowly, especially the good things, and he trusts that bad things will evolve similarly.
14911	LTW_ENG_20080316.0026.LDC2009T13	He will swerve at the last moment.
14912	LTW_ENG_20080316.0026.LDC2009T13	The possibility of a head-on collision, swift and devastating, simply never occurs to him.
14913	LTW_ENG_20080316.0026.LDC2009T13	Even worse, though he knows that the world doesn't work this way, he convinces himself that if he's caught, people will treat him fairly.
14914	LTW_ENG_20080316.0026.LDC2009T13	Sure, he has shamed himself, but he's done a lot of good things, too, and people will remember that.
14915	LTW_ENG_20080316.0026.LDC2009T13	He has always employed a kind of moral arithmetic, and he'll expect that same math to be applied to him -- all his virtues set up on one side of the ledger, his one weakness on the other.
14916	LTW_ENG_20080316.0026.LDC2009T13	People will understand that he's mostly good.
14917	LTW_ENG_20080316.0026.LDC2009T13	By the time my Eliot realizes that he's wrong about all this, it's too late.
14918	LTW_ENG_20080316.0026.LDC2009T13	The damage is done.
14919	LTW_ENG_20080316.0026.LDC2009T13	He has betrayed his wife, his children, his best self, and it's all his fault.
14920	LTW_ENG_20080316.0026.LDC2009T13	OK, that's my thumbnail fictional Eliot
14921	LTW_ENG_20080316.0026.LDC2009T13	a little thin, and maybe I like him too much.
14922	LTW_ENG_20080316.0026.LDC2009T13	Not giving his nasty, righteous streak enough play.
14923	LTW_ENG_20080316.0026.LDC2009T13	It's possible I'm giving him more credit than God would, but then God has the advantage of knowing what Eliot and I are still trying to figure out.
14924	LTW_ENG_20080316.0026.LDC2009T13	I'll learn more as I write, but there are other characters to consider.
14925	LTW_ENG_20080316.0026.LDC2009T13	First, Eliot's wife -- and here I sense a mystery even deeper than the mystery of Eliot himself.
14926	LTW_ENG_20080316.0026.LDC2009T13	Why does she stand there beside him at the podium when he confesses?
14927	LTW_ENG_20080316.0026.LDC2009T13	Why do they all?
14928	LTW_ENG_20080316.0026.LDC2009T13	I feel uniquely unqualified to look inside her heart, to ferret out her motives.
14929	LTW_ENG_20080316.0026.LDC2009T13	I make a list of what I know (not much) and what I suspect (not much more) and wonder whether imagination will fill in all those blanks.
14930	LTW_ENG_20080316.0026.LDC2009T13	I'm relatively certain of one thing: It's not this woman's fault.
14931	LTW_ENG_20080316.0026.LDC2009T13	I won't portray her as frigid or otherwise complicit in what has transpired.
14932	LTW_ENG_20080316.0026.LDC2009T13	She hasn't driven Eliot to any of this.
14933	LTW_ENG_20080316.0026.LDC2009T13	I don't believe in perfection, but I've decided for the time being that she's been a good wife, a good mother.
14934	LTW_ENG_20080316.0026.LDC2009T13	What I know about marriage is that identities over time tend to merge.
14935	LTW_ENG_20080316.0026.LDC2009T13	Eliot's wife was once her own person, but down the years she's lost some of that individuality, surrendered it willingly, never suspecting she might have further use for it.
14936	LTW_ENG_20080316.0026.LDC2009T13	If she's not this man's wife, then who is she?
14937	LTW_ENG_20080316.0026.LDC2009T13	Worse, can she abandon her husband without implying that her daughters should do the same to their father?
14938	LTW_ENG_20080316.0026.LDC2009T13	And what was that promise that she made?
14939	LTW_ENG_20080316.0026.LDC2009T13	For better or for worse?
14940	LTW_ENG_20080316.0026.LDC2009T13	Did she mean that or just say it?
14941	LTW_ENG_20080316.0026.LDC2009T13	How could it be that she was able to imagine the "better" so vividly, the "worse" not at all?
14942	LTW_ENG_20080316.0026.LDC2009T13	Was that his fault for leaving so few clues, or hers for ignoring the few there were?
14943	LTW_ENG_20080316.0026.LDC2009T13	The facts of her situation are simple and clear.
14944	LTW_ENG_20080316.0026.LDC2009T13	Why aren't her emotions?
14945	LTW_ENG_20080316.0026.LDC2009T13	Why won't they stand still so she can examine them?
14946	LTW_ENG_20080316.0026.LDC2009T13	And what of those daughters?
14947	LTW_ENG_20080316.0026.LDC2009T13	This is the hardest part for my Eliot.
14948	LTW_ENG_20080316.0026.LDC2009T13	What really tears him apart is that when the news breaks, these girls are going to have to go to school.
14949	LTW_ENG_20080316.0026.LDC2009T13	He sees them in his mind's eye now and can think of little else.
14950	LTW_ENG_20080316.0026.LDC2009T13	Sees them alone and isolated, all the other kids talking about them, growing silent when his girls walk into the room.
14951	LTW_ENG_20080316.0026.LDC2009T13	This won't go on forever, but to them it will seem like forever.
14952	LTW_ENG_20080316.0026.LDC2009T13	Eliot also fears that he's done them long-term damage.
14953	LTW_ENG_20080316.0026.LDC2009T13	Some of it can be repaired.
14954	LTW_ENG_20080316.0026.LDC2009T13	They're good, smart girls, and they won't grow up hating all men.
14955	LTW_ENG_20080316.0026.LDC2009T13	But their innocence has fled
14956	LTW_ENG_20080316.0026.LDC2009T13	they look at him now like a man wearing a partially removed disguise.
14957	LTW_ENG_20080316.0026.LDC2009T13	Never again will they take anything on faith.
14958	LTW_ENG_20080316.0026.LDC2009T13	They will be cautious in the living of their lives, taking nothing at face value.
14959	LTW_ENG_20080316.0026.LDC2009T13	They'll brace for impact when there's no reason.
14960	LTW_ENG_20080316.0026.LDC2009T13	He could have spared them all this, yet managed not to.
14961	LTW_ENG_20080316.0026.LDC2009T13	The novel's getting pretty dark, and that worries me.
14962	LTW_ENG_20080316.0026.LDC2009T13	Time for a little comic relief.
14963	LTW_ENG_20080316.0026.LDC2009T13	Real-life Eliot has few friends, we're told, the natural result of what some people like to call his arrogance, though my Eliot has never thought of it in those terms until now.
14964	LTW_ENG_20080316.0026.LDC2009T13	Arrogant?
14965	LTW_ENG_20080316.0026.LDC2009T13	He'd simply tried to put criminals in jail where they belonged.
14966	LTW_ENG_20080316.0026.LDC2009T13	Wasn't that his job?
14967	LTW_ENG_20080316.0026.LDC2009T13	Is that any reason he should be friendless now?
14968	LTW_ENG_20080316.0026.LDC2009T13	So I'll give my Eliot one friend, someone to help him put what he's done into perspective.
14969	LTW_ENG_20080316.0026.LDC2009T13	I'll give this friend some of my own cynical humor.
14970	LTW_ENG_20080316.0026.LDC2009T13	Ah, what the hell, I'll give him my name.
14971	LTW_ENG_20080316.0026.LDC2009T13	Call him Rick.
14972	LTW_ENG_20080316.0026.LDC2009T13	I can change that later with a keystroke.
14973	LTW_ENG_20080316.0026.LDC2009T13	Before everything begins to unravel, Eliot confides to Rick that he's made a mess of things, betrayed everyone he loves, that he isn't even sure who he is anymore.
14974	LTW_ENG_20080316.0026.LDC2009T13	But Rick will tell him not to be melodramatic.
14975	LTW_ENG_20080316.0026.LDC2009T13	It's true that he's made mistakes, big ones, Rick explains, but they aren't what Eliot thinks they are.
14976	LTW_ENG_20080316.0026.LDC2009T13	Rick admits he's outraged that Eliot has spent $80,000 on prostitutes, because it shouldn't cost that much to get a little action in America.
14977	LTW_ENG_20080316.0026.LDC2009T13	It's like one of those $500 Pentagon hammers.
14978	LTW_ENG_20080316.0026.LDC2009T13	Downright wasteful.
14979	LTW_ENG_20080316.0026.LDC2009T13	And why order a hammer from New Jersey and pay the shipping?
14980	LTW_ENG_20080316.0026.LDC2009T13	There are perfectly good hammers in Washington -- it's a damned city of hammers, when you think about it.
14981	LTW_ENG_20080316.0026.LDC2009T13	Where on earth did Eliot get the idea that New Jersey hammers were superior?
14982	LTW_ENG_20080316.0026.LDC2009T13	All he wanted to do was nail something, right?
14983	LTW_ENG_20080316.0026.LDC2009T13	Don't joke, Eliot tells Rick.
14984	LTW_ENG_20080316.0026.LDC2009T13	This isn't funny
14985	LTW_ENG_20080316.0026.LDC2009T13	he could go to jail.
14986	LTW_ENG_20080316.0026.LDC2009T13	But to Rick's way of thinking, that's the biggest joke of all.
14987	LTW_ENG_20080316.0026.LDC2009T13	Your average CEO can claim millions in salary and stock options in the same year his company is going down the tubes, and it's all perfectly legal.
14988	LTW_ENG_20080316.0026.LDC2009T13	You want to know what you're really guilty of, Eliot?
14989	LTW_ENG_20080316.0026.LDC2009T13	Cluelessness.
14990	LTW_ENG_20080316.0026.LDC2009T13	You didn't forget who you are, you forgot where you are.
14991	LTW_ENG_20080316.0026.LDC2009T13	This is America, pal, where you can lead the nation into war on false pretenses and be rewarded with a second term in office, but where illicit sex is and has always been an impeachable offense.
14992	LTW_ENG_20080316.0026.LDC2009T13	(Note to self: A little of this Rick character goes a long way.)
14993	LTW_ENG_20080316.0026.LDC2009T13	How will my Eliot's story end?
14994	LTW_ENG_20080316.0026.LDC2009T13	Do I wait for real-life events to unfold or make something up?
14995	LTW_ENG_20080316.0026.LDC2009T13	What kind of story will it be?
14996	LTW_ENG_20080316.0026.LDC2009T13	A tragedy?
14997	LTW_ENG_20080316.0026.LDC2009T13	Maybe, but somehow I don't think so.
14998	LTW_ENG_20080316.0026.LDC2009T13	My Eliot's no Gatsby, and there's no reason he should wind up floating face-down in the pool.
14999	LTW_ENG_20080316.0026.LDC2009T13	What he's really done is blown it.
15000	LTW_ENG_20080316.0026.LDC2009T13	He's had a great opportunity, and he's blown it.
15001	LTW_ENG_20080316.0026.LDC2009T13	There will be both private and public consequences.
15002	LTW_ENG_20080316.0026.LDC2009T13	He will be punished, and he will punish himself.
15003	LTW_ENG_20080316.0026.LDC2009T13	He will survive.
15004	LTW_ENG_20080316.0026.LDC2009T13	So will his family.
15005	LTW_ENG_20080316.0026.LDC2009T13	People do.
15006	LTW_ENG_20080316.0026.LDC2009T13	What is the basis for such breezy optimism?
15007	LTW_ENG_20080316.0026.LDC2009T13	Well, for one, there's historical precedent.
15008	LTW_ENG_20080316.0026.LDC2009T13	Hillary Clinton wasn't done in by her knucklehead husband.

15016	LTW_ENG_20080318.0026.LDC2009T13	Cost Nearly Doubles for Marine One Helicopter Fleet
15017	LTW_ENG_20080318.0026.LDC2009T13	A year after Sept. 11, 2001, the White House set out to build a fleet of state-of-the-art Marine One helicopters for the al-Qaida age that would be safer, faster and more reliable than the iconic white-topped aircraft that have landed on the South Lawn for decades.
15018	LTW_ENG_20080318.0026.LDC2009T13	But the al-Qaida age has met the military acquisition process.
15019	LTW_ENG_20080318.0026.LDC2009T13	Six years later, the cost of the new helicopters has nearly doubled, production has fallen behind schedule, and the bulk of the program has been put on hold while the government tries to figure out how to salvage it.
15020	LTW_ENG_20080318.0026.LDC2009T13	The Pentagon confirmed this month that the cost of the fleet of 28 new super-sophisticated helicopters has jumped from $6.1 billion when the contract was signed in 2005 to $11.2 billion today.
15021	LTW_ENG_20080318.0026.LDC2009T13	Outfitted with cutting-edge communications equipment, antimissile defenses and hardened hulls, each of the VH-71 helicopters, to be dubbed Marine One whenever the president is onboard, will cost $400 million.
15022	LTW_ENG_20080318.0026.LDC2009T13	That price tag is more than the one for the most recent Boeing 747 jetliner outfitted to serve as Air Force One when it was delivered in 1990, even when adjusted for inflation.
15023	LTW_ENG_20080318.0026.LDC2009T13	The problems have generated consternation in the White House, Congress and Pentagon as officials attempt to grapple with yet another military hardware purchase that has expanded beyond initial parameters.
15024	LTW_ENG_20080318.0026.LDC2009T13	In this case, though, they face the challenge of ensuring that the president is safe from all sorts of theoretical dangers and capable of running the country from midair during a crisis.
15025	LTW_ENG_20080318.0026.LDC2009T13	"You don't think of it in terms of what's the cost of the individual helicopter," said Jacques Gansler, a former undersecretary of defense for acquisition, who has been asked to review the project for the Defense Science Board.
15026	LTW_ENG_20080318.0026.LDC2009T13	"You think of it as, what do we need to do to protect the president?"
15027	LTW_ENG_20080318.0026.LDC2009T13	As a result, a vehicle that was supposed to be a modified version of an existing helicopter "grows into an entirely different thing," he said.
15028	LTW_ENG_20080318.0026.LDC2009T13	The specifications of the new craft remain largely secret, but some details have leaked into trade publications or been disclosed in congressional briefings.
15029	LTW_ENG_20080318.0026.LDC2009T13	The 64-foot-long helicopters must carry 14 passengers and thousands of pounds of additional equipment while being able to fly farther without refueling than existing Marine One choppers can.
15030	LTW_ENG_20080318.0026.LDC2009T13	They must be able to jam enemy radar, fend off incoming missiles and resist some of the electromagnetic effects of a nuclear blast.
15031	LTW_ENG_20080318.0026.LDC2009T13	They also must have videoconferencing and encrypted communications gear to allow the president to instantly reach advisers, military officers and foreign leaders.
15032	LTW_ENG_20080318.0026.LDC2009T13	Although the president typically spends only short periods of time aboard the White House helicopters, at times the president can be onboard for longer distances.
15033	LTW_ENG_20080318.0026.LDC2009T13	In a crisis, the White House says, minutes can make a difference, so a president should have the full capacity to act no matter where he or she is.
15034	LTW_ENG_20080318.0026.LDC2009T13	In theory, a commander in chief should even be able to order a nuclear strike from the helicopter.
15035	LTW_ENG_20080318.0026.LDC2009T13	Why the cost has risen so much since the contract was signed with a team led by Lockheed Martin remains in dispute.
15036	LTW_ENG_20080318.0026.LDC2009T13	The company declined to comment but has complained to supporters that the Navy added 1,900 more requirements to the helicopters.
15037	LTW_ENG_20080318.0026.LDC2009T13	The Navy denies that, saying no extra requirements were added after the contract.
15038	LTW_ENG_20080318.0026.LDC2009T13	"It's not the truth," said Stephanie Vendrasco, a spokeswoman for the Navy program.
15039	LTW_ENG_20080318.0026.LDC2009T13	"And we can't figure out where that number comes from.
15040	LTW_ENG_20080318.0026.LDC2009T13	It's a myth, and it's becoming a legend."
15041	LTW_ENG_20080318.0026.LDC2009T13	But she and other officials said no one completely grasped the demands for the helicopter at first.
15042	LTW_ENG_20080318.0026.LDC2009T13	"The Navy and industry team did not clearly realize the full implications of the White House requirements," John Young Jr., the undersecretary of defense for acquisition, said in a written response to questions.
15043	LTW_ENG_20080318.0026.LDC2009T13	To meet those requirements and retrofit a commercial aircraft to Navy standards, he said, "the Navy and industry teams are having to complete substantial redesign" of the helicopter.
15044	LTW_ENG_20080318.0026.LDC2009T13	He added that "this redesign work is driving significant cost growth into the program."
15045	LTW_ENG_20080318.0026.LDC2009T13	Vendrasco attributed the problems partly to an attempt to speed up the normal development process by three years.
15046	LTW_ENG_20080318.0026.LDC2009T13	"There was just a slow start out of the gate," she said.
15047	LTW_ENG_20080318.0026.LDC2009T13	"And schedule is money."
15048	LTW_ENG_20080318.0026.LDC2009T13	The White House has insisted the project go forward.
15049	LTW_ENG_20080318.0026.LDC2009T13	"We took a look at what is the best thing to do for future presidents but also looking at it from a cost-benefit analysis," said White House spokesman Gordon Johndroe.
15050	LTW_ENG_20080318.0026.LDC2009T13	"The consensus was future presidents need a new helicopter.
15051	LTW_ENG_20080318.0026.LDC2009T13	The current ones need to be replaced."
15052	LTW_ENG_20080318.0026.LDC2009T13	Johndroe said President Bush has no personal stake in the project because the helicopters will not be ready until after he leaves office.
15053	LTW_ENG_20080318.0026.LDC2009T13	Presidents have had helicopters at their service since 1957, when Dwight Eisenhower bristled at how long it took to get from a New England vacation getaway to an airport during a crisis.
15054	LTW_ENG_20080318.0026.LDC2009T13	Over the years, sightings of presidents boarding Marine One on the White House lawn have produced memorable moments, perhaps most famously Richard Nixon's two-armed, double-V departure after his resignation in 1974.
15055	LTW_ENG_20080318.0026.LDC2009T13	Many of the White House helicopters have been in service since that era.
15056	LTW_ENG_20080318.0026.LDC2009T13	The current fleet includes 19 aircraft -- 11 Sikorsky VH-3D Sea Kings and eight VH-60N Black Hawks -- and the oldest have flown presidents for 33 years.
15057	LTW_ENG_20080318.0026.LDC2009T13	The squadron also serves the vice president, defense secretary, Navy secretary, visiting heads of state and other officials.
15058	LTW_ENG_20080318.0026.LDC2009T13	So many helicopters are needed because the president typically travels with two or more when he flies, with the extras ferrying staff and Secret Service, serving as backups and playing decoy.
15059	LTW_ENG_20080318.0026.LDC2009T13	When a president makes multiple stops, additional sets of helicopters must be airlifted to his next destinations.
15060	LTW_ENG_20080318.0026.LDC2009T13	On Friday, for instance, Bush went to New York for an economic speech.
15061	LTW_ENG_20080318.0026.LDC2009T13	He climbed into Marine One on the South Lawn, and two other helicopters accompanied him on the 10-minute flight to Andrews Air Force Base, where he boarded Air Force One for the trip north.
15062	LTW_ENG_20080318.0026.LDC2009T13	At John F. Kennedy International Airport, another pair of helicopters waited to fly him into Manhattan.
15063	LTW_ENG_20080318.0026.LDC2009T13	Although the Marines maintain the craft with painstaking care, they occasionally break down.
15064	LTW_ENG_20080318.0026.LDC2009T13	In 2006, for example, Bush accepted the resignation of his press secretary, Scott McClellan, during an emotional moment on the South Lawn, and the two then strode to Marine One to fly off together.
15065	LTW_ENG_20080318.0026.LDC2009T13	But the helicopter would not work, and they had to get off and take a car.
15066	LTW_ENG_20080318.0026.LDC2009T13	Then-White House Chief of Staff Andrew Card Jr. grew aggravated with the aging fleet's problems in 2002, and he launched the effort to develop a new model with a post-Sept.
15067	LTW_ENG_20080318.0026.LDC2009T13	11 upgrade.
15068	LTW_ENG_20080318.0026.LDC2009T13	Although Lockheed Martin does not make helicopters, the Navy chose it over longtime contractor Sikorsky Aircraft because the company's European partner had a three-engine model that seemed a logical off-the-shelf base for a new presidential helicopter.
15069	LTW_ENG_20080318.0026.LDC2009T13	But modifying the EH-101 has proven so complicated that the company is essentially building a new helicopter.
15070	LTW_ENG_20080318.0026.LDC2009T13	The first five helicopters are due in 2010, a year behind schedule, though the White House made compromises on the requirements to cut costs and speed delivery.
15071	LTW_ENG_20080318.0026.LDC2009T13	Twenty-three more- sophisticated versions are to follow, at which point the current fleet and the first five craft would be retired.
15072	LTW_ENG_20080318.0026.LDC2009T13	But the most recent target date of 2015 for these additional choppers has slipped to an unknown date.
15073	LTW_ENG_20080318.0026.LDC2009T13	The problems with the second batch have prompted the Pentagon to issue a stop-work order until it determines what to do and Congress provides more money.
15074	LTW_ENG_20080318.0026.LDC2009T13	The Pentagon conducted a review of the project and considered 35 alternatives, but "none of these options meet the full set of White House requirements," Young said.
15075	LTW_ENG_20080318.0026.LDC2009T13	Britain last year bought six standard EH-101 helicopters for about $57 million each -- roughly one-seventh of what it will cost the United States to buy the same aircraft and retrofit it for the president.
15076	LTW_ENG_20080318.0026.LDC2009T13	Critics say that sort of mission creep has become too common.
15077	LTW_ENG_20080318.0026.LDC2009T13	"If it was going to cost $11 billion in the first place, somebody should have said so," said Tom Schatz, president of Citizens Against Government Waste.
15078	LTW_ENG_20080318.0026.LDC2009T13	Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn., whose district includes Sikorsky's headquarters, said the drastic changes in the helicopter make it a whole new aircraft, so it should be rebid.
15079	LTW_ENG_20080318.0026.LDC2009T13	After all the twists of this project, she said, "We ought to start over."
15080	LTW_ENG_20080404.0110.LDC2009T13	Putting a Special `Shine' on the Stones
15081	LTW_ENG_20080404.0110.LDC2009T13	Mick Jagger would have, that's who.
15082	LTW_ENG_20080404.0110.LDC2009T13	When asked by Dick Cavett in 1972 whether "you can picture yourself at age 60 doing what you do now," Jagger grinned and responded, "Easily, yeah."
15083	LTW_ENG_20080404.0110.LDC2009T13	Period, close quote, end of story.
15084	LTW_ENG_20080404.0110.LDC2009T13	What "Shine a Light," Martin Scorsese's concert documentary, does beautifully is illuminate the way things are now with the self- described world's greatest rock 'n' roll band.
15085	LTW_ENG_20080404.0110.LDC2009T13	We see that benefit show and a Clinton birthday concert, filmed over two nights in 2006 at New York's Beacon Theatre, and by the time it's over, we are thoroughly entertained.
15086	LTW_ENG_20080404.0110.LDC2009T13	But getting to that point turns out to have been a tougher slog than might be expected.
15087	LTW_ENG_20080404.0110.LDC2009T13	What makes it tough, frankly, is all those accumulated years.
15088	LTW_ENG_20080404.0110.LDC2009T13	It's not that the group has any difficulty performing up to its standards, it's that youth and anarchy (not always Bill Clinton's areas) are part of rock's DNA, and seeing the Stones as up close and personal as a concert film demands presents us with the unnerving spectacle of their battle-hardened, not to say sepulchral, faces.
15089	LTW_ENG_20080404.0110.LDC2009T13	This is especially the case with Jagger.
15090	LTW_ENG_20080404.0110.LDC2009T13	Yes, he can still run and jump with the best of them, but on camera, that movement plays like a practiced performance untouched by genuine emotion.
15091	LTW_ENG_20080404.0110.LDC2009T13	Rather than feeling the music, we are wondering who does his hair and what kind of an exercise and stretching routine he maintains.
15092	LTW_ENG_20080404.0110.LDC2009T13	On the other hand, though, "Sympathy for the Devil" makes us wonder if Jagger really is Mr. Scratch.
15093	LTW_ENG_20080404.0110.LDC2009T13	This is especially true after the band's rendition of "As Tears Go By," originally recorded by Marianne Faithfull, reminds us of how differently age has treated these former lovers.
15094	LTW_ENG_20080404.0110.LDC2009T13	Paradoxically, age is hardly a problem with Keith Richards.
15095	LTW_ENG_20080404.0110.LDC2009T13	With his exceptional ability to lose himself in the music -- "I don't think on stage, I feel," he says at one point -- the Stones' guitarist looks like a wraith from another dimension, a being beyond both space and time.
15096	LTW_ENG_20080404.0110.LDC2009T13	If the overall age of the group is a problem, "Shine a Light" has the resources to combat and overcome it, key among them being the amount of filmmaking craft and skill director Scorsese and his team bring to the proceedings.
15097	LTW_ENG_20080404.0110.LDC2009T13	A meticulous planner and music aficionado who worked on "Woodstock" and whose credits include "The Last Waltz" and two excellent PBS music documentary series, Scorsese is also a film preservationist who seems to relish the task of conserving the almost retro nature of these concerts, shooting not in 3-D in massive soccer stadiums the way U2 did but in 35 millimeter in a relatively intimate Broadway theater.
15098	LTW_ENG_20080404.0110.LDC2009T13	And although "Shine a Light" is largely a concert documentary, Scorsese has shrewdly included a smattering of other material, including the Cavett chat.
15099	LTW_ENG_20080404.0110.LDC2009T13	There's some behind-the-scenes footage emphasizing the comic opera aspects of preparation -- "We cannot burn Mick Jagger," the director says sternly when a lighting issue makes immolation a possibility -- as well as a selection of mostly inane interviews the group has endured over the years.
15100	LTW_ENG_20080404.0110.LDC2009T13	The heart of "Shine a Light," though, is the marvelous performance footage the 18 camera operators, led by director of photography Robert Richardson and including such major talents as Robert Elswit, John Toll, Albert Maysles, Stuart Dryburgh, Andrew Lesnie, Emmanuel Lubezki, Declan Quinn and Ellen Kuras, have managed to capture.
15101	LTW_ENG_20080404.0110.LDC2009T13	As put together in a heroic nine-month job of editing by David Tedeschi, this remarkable footage casually captures wonderful moments of musicianship and style, from Buddy Guy's intense guitar work on "Champagne and Reefer" to Ronnie Wood's hypnotic pedal steel solo on "Far Away Eyes" as well as Richards coolly spitting a cigarette out of his mouth just because he wants to.
15102	LTW_ENG_20080404.0110.LDC2009T13	Finally, it is the scorching intensity of the blues- and R&amp
15103	LTW_ENG_20080404.0110.LDC2009T13	B-inflected songs the Stones play, not any on-stage antics, that keeps the group involved in performing and the audience keyed into the film.
15104	LTW_ENG_20080404.0110.LDC2009T13	With expert backup singers and veteran musicians such as Bobby Keys on tenor sax and Darryl Jones on bass providing a solid grounding, the music's insistent richness builds and builds, its sound becoming so deep and persuasive that qualms about age fade and the rhythms carry us away.
15105	LTW_ENG_20080404.0110.LDC2009T13	The Stones have been in any number of memorable films, including 1970's "Gimme Shelter" and Robert Frank's documentary with the unprintable name, but this outing is special, because of where it arrives and the obstacles it faced along the way.
15106	LTW_ENG_20080404.0110.LDC2009T13	"Shine a Light" might not be the last Rolling Stones movie, but it's likely to be the last one with a touch of the poet about it.
15107	LTW_ENG_20080405.0047.LDC2009T13	Bhutan: `A Society on the Threshold of Change'
15108	LTW_ENG_20080405.0047.LDC2009T13	The children pounced on Nordon Gurung's lap, tugging on her long hair, spilling apple juice on her traditional skirt and singing songs in her ear, as if she were their grandmother.
15109	LTW_ENG_20080405.0047.LDC2009T13	But Gurung is not a granny, or even a relative.
15110	LTW_ENG_20080405.0047.LDC2009T13	She is a day-care provider, a once-unknown profession in this traditional and secluded Himalayan nation where grandparents have long been in charge of watching over children.
15111	LTW_ENG_20080405.0047.LDC2009T13	"To most elder Bhutanese, leaving your child here while you work is utterly mind-altering," said Gurung, as she lined up the children for their morning exercises under blossoming peach trees.
15112	LTW_ENG_20080405.0047.LDC2009T13	"But for our young, working parents, this is a wonderful lifeline."
15113	LTW_ENG_20080405.0047.LDC2009T13	The growing number of day-care centers in Bhutan is just one of the ways in which this ancient civilization is modernizing, often at rapid speeds.
15114	LTW_ENG_20080405.0047.LDC2009T13	More Bhutanese are moving to cities and away from their extended families, traditionally a vital part of the social structure here.
15115	LTW_ENG_20080405.0047.LDC2009T13	In the capital, Thimphu, young Bhutanese are wearing Western-style jeans and tuning in to satellite TV for the first time, watching programs such as "Desperate Housewives."
15116	LTW_ENG_20080405.0047.LDC2009T13	Now, many fear Bhutan's unique culture will be diluted, or even overtaken, by the powerful forces of globalization.
15117	LTW_ENG_20080405.0047.LDC2009T13	"Bhutan is a society on the threshold of change," said Namgay Zam, 22, a disc jockey at "Kazoo FM: The Voice of the Youth."
15118	LTW_ENG_20080405.0047.LDC2009T13	"We're struggling to find the right balance.
15119	LTW_ENG_20080405.0047.LDC2009T13	It's one of the most challenging questions for the next generation: How do you modernize, but also remain Bhutanese?"
15120	LTW_ENG_20080405.0047.LDC2009T13	Sandwiched between China and India, the world's most populous nations, rugged, forested Bhutan is landlocked and has just 2.2 million people.
15121	LTW_ENG_20080405.0047.LDC2009T13	It has long feared for its survival.
15122	LTW_ENG_20080405.0047.LDC2009T13	Bhutanese watched nervously as Tibet was occupied by China in 1950 and the tiny Himalayan kingdom of Sikkim was swallowed up by India in 1975.
15123	LTW_ENG_20080405.0047.LDC2009T13	Bhutan has remained peaceful.
15124	LTW_ENG_20080405.0047.LDC2009T13	Buddhist prayer wheels sit like kings in village squares, and centuries-old fortresses poke up through blue pine forests.
15125	LTW_ENG_20080405.0047.LDC2009T13	The country's revered king, Jigme Singye Wangchuck, abdicated in favor of his son in 2006, but he transformed Bhutanese life in ways that remain evident.
15126	LTW_ENG_20080405.0047.LDC2009T13	He made national dress compulsory at offices and temples -- men wear a kilt-like gho, with black knee- high socks
15127	LTW_ENG_20080405.0047.LDC2009T13	women sport colorful, floor-length skirts -- and he introduced a philosophy he called gross national happiness.
15128	LTW_ENG_20080405.0047.LDC2009T13	It's a measure of happiness built around the idea of retaining Bhutan's culture and protecting its pristine streams and forests.
15129	LTW_ENG_20080405.0047.LDC2009T13	Fresh from elections last month that ended more than a century of royal rule, Bhutan is now a constitutional monarchy.
15130	LTW_ENG_20080405.0047.LDC2009T13	It's struggling to do what many other countries have struggled to do: open up to the world while retaining its way of life.
15131	LTW_ENG_20080405.0047.LDC2009T13	One Bhutanese leader has remarked that Bhutan may well be the last country on earth to allow a McDonald's to raise its arches, which here would sit among monasteries and pagodas.
15132	LTW_ENG_20080405.0047.LDC2009T13	Bhutan's royal government didn't legalize satellite television until 1999.
15133	LTW_ENG_20080405.0047.LDC2009T13	It was the last country in the world to introduce broadcast television.
15134	LTW_ENG_20080405.0047.LDC2009T13	It did, however, later ban MTV and the World Wrestling Entertainment channel.
15135	LTW_ENG_20080405.0047.LDC2009T13	"Apparently it was making the youth too violent, since they were wrestling each other all day.
15136	LTW_ENG_20080405.0047.LDC2009T13	The government felt this violence was not Buddhist and goes against our gross national happiness philosophy," Zam, the DJ, said with a laugh.
15137	LTW_ENG_20080405.0047.LDC2009T13	She said she opposed the ban, but also saw the reason for it.
15138	LTW_ENG_20080405.0047.LDC2009T13	"Maybe it was a good thing to be able to understand our Bhutanese identity first, and then open up to the world," she said.
15139	LTW_ENG_20080405.0047.LDC2009T13	Bhutan likes doing things its own way.
15140	LTW_ENG_20080405.0047.LDC2009T13	It is the only country in the world to ban the sale of tobacco.
15141	LTW_ENG_20080405.0047.LDC2009T13	Thimphu is the only capital in the world without a traffic light
15142	LTW_ENG_20080405.0047.LDC2009T13	instead, a white-gloved traffic officer directs cars, pedestrians and yak herds.
15143	LTW_ENG_20080405.0047.LDC2009T13	The city had a zoo, but freed the animals, saying it wasn't in the Buddhist spirit to cage the national mammal, the takin, which has the head of a goat and the body of a moose.
15144	LTW_ENG_20080405.0047.LDC2009T13	While Bhutan's ways are quirky, the culture, at least in urban areas, is morphing into something new.
15145	LTW_ENG_20080405.0047.LDC2009T13	Thimphu's central square is filled with teen-agers strumming guitars and wearing buttons with the names of rock bands such as Metallica.
15146	LTW_ENG_20080405.0047.LDC2009T13	A transvestite recently went out in public to a disco -- a sign, the DJs at Kazoo said, that youth culture is open to previously shunned ideas.
15147	LTW_ENG_20080405.0047.LDC2009T13	Many younger Bhutanese have started to fuse their culture with the tastes of the West.
15148	LTW_ENG_20080405.0047.LDC2009T13	The Zone Cafe in Thimphu, for instance, serves yak burgers and pizza with yak meat.
15149	LTW_ENG_20080405.0047.LDC2009T13	A Bhutanese fashion designer, Sangay Choden, put Velcro around the waist of her traditional kiras to make them easier to wear.
15150	LTW_ENG_20080405.0047.LDC2009T13	"I wanted to be creative and voice what our youth feel today.
15151	LTW_ENG_20080405.0047.LDC2009T13	But I also wanted to keep being Bhutanese," Choden said.
15152	LTW_ENG_20080405.0047.LDC2009T13	"It can be done."
15153	LTW_ENG_20080405.0047.LDC2009T13	That's what parents at Gurung's day-care center are hoping for.
15154	LTW_ENG_20080405.0047.LDC2009T13	Because the government is wary of permitting too much change too quickly, it has placed restrictions on day-care centers, licensing only those that watch children over the age of 3.
15155	LTW_ENG_20080405.0047.LDC2009T13	The decision has effectively pushed grandparents to stay at home for the first years of a child's life or working parents to hire a nanny.
15156	LTW_ENG_20080405.0047.LDC2009T13	Now, parents at Gurung's center are lobbying the government to allow day care for younger children.
15157	LTW_ENG_20080405.0047.LDC2009T13	They say the rules could require them to be at the center during work breaks and lunches.
15158	LTW_ENG_20080405.0047.LDC2009T13	"Day-care centers will keep evolving," said Gado Tshering, secretary of health.
15159	LTW_ENG_20080405.0047.LDC2009T13	"But we don't always want to completely copy the West.
15160	LTW_ENG_20080405.0047.LDC2009T13	Imagine if we opened those, how do you say ... old-age homes?
15161	LTW_ENG_20080405.0047.LDC2009T13	Imagine if Bhutanese people actually started to kick out their grandparents?
15162	LTW_ENG_20080405.0047.LDC2009T13	We just couldn't allow such a thing."
15163	LTW_ENG_20080410.0115.LDC2009T13	Bill Would Require Faster Warnings to Students
15164	LTW_ENG_20080410.0115.LDC2009T13	"Many believe if the students had been notified earlier, they might not have gone to class," McCarthy said Wednesday.
15165	LTW_ENG_20080410.0115.LDC2009T13	The law currently requires universities to notify students in a "timely manner."
15166	LTW_ENG_20080410.0115.LDC2009T13	But McCarthy said that standard is too subjective and could cost lives, like at Virginia Tech -- when the university waited nearly two hours to e-mail students that a gunman was on campus.
15167	LTW_ENG_20080410.0115.LDC2009T13	Thirty-two people were killed.
15168	LTW_ENG_20080410.0115.LDC2009T13	McCarthy's proposal also requires that universities annually publish and test emergency response procedures.
15169	LTW_ENG_20080410.0115.LDC2009T13	Colleges would have until 2009 to set up campus-wide alert systems using whatever method they chose -- such as automated cell-phone calls or text messages -- but the proposal doesn't yet include funds for institutions to do so.
15170	LTW_ENG_20080410.0115.LDC2009T13	Gun violence hits home for McCarthy -- whose son was injured and her husband killed by a gunman while riding a Long Island Rail Road train in 1993.
15171	LTW_ENG_20080410.0115.LDC2009T13	The tragedy was the platform that propelled her to a seat in Congress.
15172	LTW_ENG_20080410.0115.LDC2009T13	On Long Island, Stony Brook University used its own emergency system in late February -- when a cafeteria worker falsely reported a man with a gun.
15173	LTW_ENG_20080410.0115.LDC2009T13	The university alerted students 26 minutes after getting the report, a reasonable amount of time to respond to such a threat -- but which might not be feasible at other times, said Robert Lenahan, university emergency management director.
15174	LTW_ENG_20080410.0115.LDC2009T13	"There may be some circumstances where you may need to take a little more time to verify the accuracy," Lenahan said.
15175	LTW_ENG_20080410.0115.LDC2009T13	That's why the American Council on Education opposes the "one- size-fits-all mandate," said Terry W. Hartle, the council's senior vice president for government and public affairs.
15176	LTW_ENG_20080410.0115.LDC2009T13	"Campus security officers want to convey information as timely, accurate and useful," Hartle said.
15177	LTW_ENG_20080410.0115.LDC2009T13	"If you choose one of those three over the others, you may not be providing the best information people need."
15178	LTW_ENG_20080410.0115.LDC2009T13	But alerts within 30 minutes could save lives, said Joe Samaha, father of Virginia Tech victim Reema Samaha.
15179	LTW_ENG_20080410.0115.LDC2009T13	"If we do not learn the lesson, we will have lost our students for nothing," he said.
15180	LTW_ENG_20080412.0013.LDC2009T13	Just Right for Hip Moms
15181	LTW_ENG_20080412.0013.LDC2009T13	forget about it!
15182	LTW_ENG_20080412.0013.LDC2009T13	There are too many toos to ponder.
15183	LTW_ENG_20080412.0013.LDC2009T13	What most moms need are a few good essentials.
15184	LTW_ENG_20080412.0013.LDC2009T13	And luckily this spring, they can stay on trend and be comfortable without breaking their kid-strained bank accounts.
15185	LTW_ENG_20080412.0013.LDC2009T13	Color can splash a dash of youthful hipness onto parenthood.

15197	LTW_ENG_20080424.0004.LDC2009T13	Ending the Guessing Game in Concussion Recovery
15198	LTW_ENG_20080424.0004.LDC2009T13	As athletes at Hammond High School in Columbia, Md., headed off to games and practices after school Friday, junior varsity lacrosse player Jake Rotter strolled to an empty computer lab to once again square off against his stiffest adversary: himself.
15199	LTW_ENG_20080424.0004.LDC2009T13	Rotter sustained a concussion during the junior varsity football season, experienced lingering headaches that prompted him to leave the wrestling team and then endured another concussion playing lacrosse this spring.
15200	LTW_ENG_20080424.0004.LDC2009T13	In previous years, the school's athletic trainer and Rotter's doctor would have monitored his symptoms -- if there were obvious signs, which is not always the case -- and made a determination about when he could return to action.
15201	LTW_ENG_20080424.0004.LDC2009T13	Now Howard County schools can join other school districts that can make quantifiable decisions with the ImPACT (Immediate Post- Concussion Assessment and Cognitive Testing) program, a tool to help track recovery from concussions.
15202	LTW_ENG_20080424.0004.LDC2009T13	The program, developed by Mark Lovell at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, is used by professional sports teams, colleges and hundreds of high schools in the United States.
15203	LTW_ENG_20080424.0004.LDC2009T13	Howard began using it this school year, and it is free to students, with parental permission.
15204	LTW_ENG_20080424.0004.LDC2009T13	Here's how it works: Before the season, an athlete takes the computerized ImPACT test, which, in part, measures his memory and reaction time after being shown a series of words, designs, patterns and symbols.
15205	LTW_ENG_20080424.0004.LDC2009T13	It takes about 25 minutes.
15206	LTW_ENG_20080424.0004.LDC2009T13	There is no particular score for which to strive
15207	LTW_ENG_20080424.0004.LDC2009T13	each athlete's results provide a baseline of information.
15208	LTW_ENG_20080424.0004.LDC2009T13	"It definitely tests you," Rotter said.
15209	LTW_ENG_20080424.0004.LDC2009T13	If the athlete experiences a head injury, he retakes the test to see how his results compare with his baseline reading.
15210	LTW_ENG_20080424.0004.LDC2009T13	Is there a lapse in memory?
15211	LTW_ENG_20080424.0004.LDC2009T13	Reaction time?
15212	LTW_ENG_20080424.0004.LDC2009T13	Some other decline in performance?
15213	LTW_ENG_20080424.0004.LDC2009T13	If his retest results fall markedly short of his baseline numbers, he probably will be deemed not ready to play.
15214	LTW_ENG_20080424.0004.LDC2009T13	The athlete will continue to sit out until his ImPACT scores are close to his pre-concussion results.
15215	LTW_ENG_20080424.0004.LDC2009T13	The ImPACT test findings remove some of the guesswork about whether an athlete is fit to resume play, and the graphic representation of results makes it easy to explain to athletes and their parents why the athlete might or might not be fully recovered from a head injury.
15216	LTW_ENG_20080424.0004.LDC2009T13	"There's a real gap in the knowledge of this injury," said Gerry Gioia, director of neuropsychology and director of the Safe Concussion Outcome, Recovery and Education (SCORE) Program at Children's National Medical Center in Washington.
15217	LTW_ENG_20080424.0004.LDC2009T13	"What happens is families and kids are getting lots of different messages about whether they can go back to play or not, and many times it's not based on any objective or systematic data."
15218	LTW_ENG_20080424.0004.LDC2009T13	To learn more about the ImPACT program, and to take the test ourselves, we caught up with Rotter, 16, and Hammond athletic trainer Tim Happel on Friday when Rotter was retaking the test for the second time since sustaining a concussion late last month.
15219	LTW_ENG_20080424.0004.LDC2009T13	Rotter first got concussed in first grade in a bike accident.
15220	LTW_ENG_20080424.0004.LDC2009T13	He lost his short-term memory for a few days.
15221	LTW_ENG_20080424.0004.LDC2009T13	A person who sustains a concussion can be more vulnerable to concussion than those who have not sustained such an injury.
15222	LTW_ENG_20080424.0004.LDC2009T13	"Oh, another butterfly gave you a concussion?"
15223	LTW_ENG_20080424.0004.LDC2009T13	a buddy said to Rotter recently, jokingly suggesting that the middle linebacker- offensive lineman and lacrosse defender, known for his physical playing style, is soft.
15224	LTW_ENG_20080424.0004.LDC2009T13	When Rotter, who is enrolled in honors courses, is concussed, he suffers from headaches and a lack of concentration.
15225	LTW_ENG_20080424.0004.LDC2009T13	"It feels like you have a haze over you, a fog, kind of," he said, adding that his grade-point average dipped from about a 3.57 to a 2.71 in the fall when he had trouble focusing after his football concussion.
15226	LTW_ENG_20080424.0004.LDC2009T13	"He's in all really, really intense classes, so concussions have much more effect there than on the field," said his mother, Julie.
15227	LTW_ENG_20080424.0004.LDC2009T13	Rotter could tell when he took the first retest April 2 that he was not particularly sharp.
15228	LTW_ENG_20080424.0004.LDC2009T13	He noticed further improvement Friday afternoon, taking it for a second time since his lacrosse concussion.
15229	LTW_ENG_20080424.0004.LDC2009T13	But before clearing him to play, Happel wanted to consult with Gioia, who helped develop the concussion treatment program for Howard schools.
15230	LTW_ENG_20080424.0004.LDC2009T13	(Gioia's children play sports at Mount Hebron High in Ellicott City, Md.)
15231	LTW_ENG_20080424.0004.LDC2009T13	"It seemed like I could remember the shapes a lot easier," Rotter said after his second retest.
15232	LTW_ENG_20080424.0004.LDC2009T13	"I was a lot faster, it felt like.
15233	LTW_ENG_20080424.0004.LDC2009T13	It was a pretty obvious difference."
15234	LTW_ENG_20080424.0004.LDC2009T13	Mike Williams, coordinator of athletics for Howard schools, said that the county's dozen high schools have tested an average of about 200 athletes each.
15235	LTW_ENG_20080424.0004.LDC2009T13	With the program becoming more established, he expects that number to grow to 400 or more next school year.
15236	LTW_ENG_20080424.0004.LDC2009T13	"They used to say after two days you could return" from a concussion, Williams said.
15237	LTW_ENG_20080424.0004.LDC2009T13	"Then it went to a week.
15238	LTW_ENG_20080424.0004.LDC2009T13	Now research shows that with high school students, their brains are still developing, and a sustained concussion in a high school student can impact their learning and development for a lifetime.
15239	LTW_ENG_20080424.0004.LDC2009T13	When we saw that, that's what really sold us.
15240	LTW_ENG_20080424.0004.LDC2009T13	It's not a perfect science, but it's the best thing out there."
15241	LTW_ENG_20080424.0004.LDC2009T13	The cost of the program is $9,000 for the software, about $750 for each of Howard's 12 high schools.
15242	LTW_ENG_20080424.0004.LDC2009T13	But for school systems without certified athletic trainers, administering and interpreting the tests could be a problem.
15243	LTW_ENG_20080424.0004.LDC2009T13	Howard has a trainer.
15244	LTW_ENG_20080424.0004.LDC2009T13	For athletes itching to get back on the field, the ImPACT test can be friend or foe: friend if it raises no red flags, which might result in getting back sooner, or foe if the athlete feels fine -- or is downplaying symptoms, which is common -- but falls short of baseline benchmarks when retaking the test.
15245	LTW_ENG_20080424.0004.LDC2009T13	Oh, and don't try to lowball your initial ImPACT test.
15246	LTW_ENG_20080424.0004.LDC2009T13	Not only could it be hazardous to your health, it could be embarrassing.
15247	LTW_ENG_20080424.0004.LDC2009T13	Gioia said the test has indicators that expose sandbaggers.
15248	LTW_ENG_20080424.0004.LDC2009T13	"I feel like (the ImPACT test) is holding me back a little bit," Rotter said, "but I'm also glad it exists.
15249	LTW_ENG_20080424.0004.LDC2009T13	Because if it didn't exist, I'd be back on the field and getting another concussion and be in a worse state."

15251	LTW_ENG_20080425.0040.LDC2009T13	Add this to the list of indignities Sen. Larry Craig, R-Idaho, has suffered since getting busted in an airport restroom last June: He now has to pay his legal dream team out of his own pocket.
15252	LTW_ENG_20080425.0040.LDC2009T13	Per the Senate Ethics Committee's Feb. 13 "admonition" of him for his guilty plea to disorderly conduct charges, Craig has not paid any of his top-flight lawyers from his campaign committee since early February.
15253	LTW_ENG_20080425.0040.LDC2009T13	The last legal payment from Craig for U.S. Senate, in the form of an $80,695 check, went out on Feb. 3 to Billy Martin's firm of Sutherland Asbill &amp
15254	LTW_ENG_20080425.0040.LDC2009T13	Brennan.
15255	LTW_ENG_20080425.0040.LDC2009T13	According to reports his campaign committee filed with the Federal Election Commission, that put Craig's total legal tab at more than $407,000 since he was arrested June 11 at the Minneapolis-St.
15256	LTW_ENG_20080425.0040.LDC2009T13	Paul International Airport in an undercover sting designed to root out lewd behavior.
15257	LTW_ENG_20080425.0040.LDC2009T13	But Craig never sought permission from the Ethics Committee to use his campaign funds to pay Martin and Stan Brand, the lawyer who helped him handle the matter before the committee.
15258	LTW_ENG_20080425.0040.LDC2009T13	The panel's three-page letter concluded that Craig had engaged in "improper conduct which has reflected discreditably on the Senate" and warned him against any future legal expenses because the senator's arrest may not have "occurred in connection with your official duties."
15259	LTW_ENG_20080425.0040.LDC2009T13	Craig's office declined to comment.
15260	LTW_ENG_20080425.0040.LDC2009T13	Brand told "On the Hill" this week that Craig is now in "full compliance" with the ethics admonishment.
15261	LTW_ENG_20080425.0040.LDC2009T13	"I'm paid in full," Brand added, noting that his work for Craig concluded once the committee finished its deliberations.
15262	LTW_ENG_20080425.0040.LDC2009T13	But Craig is continuing his appeal of a Minnesota court ruling that upheld his guilty plea, and he is continuing to rack up legal bills with Martin's firm.
15263	LTW_ENG_20080425.0040.LDC2009T13	He is left to fight this uphill battle with his own finances -- which are incredibly meager.
15264	LTW_ENG_20080425.0040.LDC2009T13	Aside from a pair of retirement accounts, Craig has just one other account to draw from.
15265	LTW_ENG_20080425.0040.LDC2009T13	It's with the Senate's federal credit union and contains between $50,000 and $100,000, according to a financial disclosure report filed with the Senate.
15266	LTW_ENG_20080520.0046.LDC2009T13	Could Shia LaBeouf Fill Harrison Ford's Fedora?
15267	LTW_ENG_20080520.0046.LDC2009T13	"Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull" brings everyone's favorite archaeologist into the 1950s, and although he remains true to his 1930s serial-hero vibe, he's sharing the screen with a young costar in LaBeouf who, in his leather jacket, cuffed jeans and scowl, looks clearly modeled on Marlon Brando from "The Wild One."
15268	LTW_ENG_20080520.0046.LDC2009T13	LaBeouf's character has switchblade swagger and wounded eyes and the intriguing name of Mutt Williams -- Mutt sure makes it sound as if he's looking for his lineage, doesn't it?
15269	LTW_ENG_20080520.0046.LDC2009T13	Harrison Ford wouldn't touch that question, but he did praise LaBeouf.
15270	LTW_ENG_20080520.0046.LDC2009T13	"He's young, but he's an old soul, and he's been an actor most of his life
15271	LTW_ENG_20080520.0046.LDC2009T13	he knows what he's doing."
15272	LTW_ENG_20080520.0046.LDC2009T13	LaBeouf's career trajectory is going strong and, who knows, maybe "Indy" director Steven Spielberg (who was also a producer of the LaBeouf-starring "Transformers") has found his screen hero for the next two decades.
15273	LTW_ENG_20080724.0012.LDC2009T13	India's Outstretched Hand: New Delhi Does Its Part to Salvage a Nuclear Pact
15274	LTW_ENG_20080724.0012.LDC2009T13	Now It's Congress's Turn
15275	LTW_ENG_20080724.0012.LDC2009T13	The following editorial appeared in Wednesday's Washington Post:
15276	LTW_ENG_20080724.0012.LDC2009T13	Until recently, it seemed that an ambitious Bush administration bid to restore nuclear cooperation between the United States and India might be dead, a victim of domestic Indian politics.
15277	LTW_ENG_20080724.0012.LDC2009T13	Anti- American communist parties that support Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's centrist government were blocking the deal.
15278	LTW_ENG_20080724.0012.LDC2009T13	But Mr. Singh took a bold risk to salvage the pact, trading communist support for that of a smaller regional party in hopes of assembling a new majority.
15279	LTW_ENG_20080724.0012.LDC2009T13	This week the gamble paid off, as Mr. Singh's government survived a parliamentary no-confidence vote.
15280	LTW_ENG_20080724.0012.LDC2009T13	Now, the question is whether the pact can survive the American political process.
15281	LTW_ENG_20080724.0012.LDC2009T13	There isn't much time
15282	LTW_ENG_20080724.0012.LDC2009T13	under U.S. law, Congress must be in session continuously for 30 days to consider the deal.
15283	LTW_ENG_20080724.0012.LDC2009T13	Before that clock can start, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the 45-nation Nuclear Suppliers Group must give India a green light.
15284	LTW_ENG_20080724.0012.LDC2009T13	While those approvals are likely, they won't happen instantaneously.
15285	LTW_ENG_20080724.0012.LDC2009T13	And because of the long August recess, there may not be more than 30 "legislative days" left before Congress adjourns on Sept. 26.
15286	LTW_ENG_20080724.0012.LDC2009T13	The deal raises many legitimate questions.
15287	LTW_ENG_20080724.0012.LDC2009T13	But, on balance, it is in the United States' interest, and Congress should find the time to say yes -- in a lame-duck session after the November election, if necessary.
15288	LTW_ENG_20080724.0012.LDC2009T13	U.S. nuclear cooperation with India ceased when India, which had refused to sign the 1968 Non-Proliferation Treaty, exploded a nuclear "device" in 1974.
15289	LTW_ENG_20080724.0012.LDC2009T13	The sanctions were intended to show India, and the world, that there was a price to be paid for flouting the treaty.
15290	LTW_ENG_20080724.0012.LDC2009T13	Times change, though, and the Bush administration's logic is that the benefits of a "strategic partnership" with India outweigh the risks of waiving the old rules.
15291	LTW_ENG_20080724.0012.LDC2009T13	If booming India uses more nuclear energy, it will emit less in greenhouse gases.
15292	LTW_ENG_20080724.0012.LDC2009T13	Unlike Pakistan, India has developed its nuclear arsenal without leaking materials or know-how to others.
15293	LTW_ENG_20080724.0012.LDC2009T13	Perhaps the fact that India is a democracy that shares not only values but interests -- checking China, fighting Islamist terrorism -- with the United States matters more than its signature on a treaty.
15294	LTW_ENG_20080724.0012.LDC2009T13	It's a bet worth making, especially since the agreement creates more international supervision of India's nuclear fuel cycle than there would be without it.
15295	LTW_ENG_20080724.0012.LDC2009T13	To be sure, it is a risk.
15296	LTW_ENG_20080724.0012.LDC2009T13	The deal weakens the U.S. threat to cut off uranium if India conducts another nuclear test.
15297	LTW_ENG_20080724.0012.LDC2009T13	India's economic ties and military-to-military contacts with Iran are worrisome, as is its stubborn habit of taking "nonaligned" stances against U.S. interests.
15298	LTW_ENG_20080724.0012.LDC2009T13	But the fact that Mr. Singh successfully ditched the communists for the sake of closer ties with Washington is a hopeful sign that the agreement is already inducing moderation.
15299	LTW_ENG_20080724.0012.LDC2009T13	At this point, if Congress rejects the deal, the likeliest outcome -- in addition to much ill will in New Delhi -- is that India, freshly approved as a customer for technology and fuel by the IAEA and the Suppliers Group, will simply buy its planned 25,000 megawatts of nuclear capacity from France or Russia.
15300	LTW_ENG_20080724.0012.LDC2009T13	After much delay, Mr. Singh has done his part
15301	LTW_ENG_20080724.0012.LDC2009T13	now it's Congress's turn.
15302	LTW_ENG_20080801.0081.LDC2009T13	Residents Return to Homes Near Yosemite Fire
15303	LTW_ENG_20080801.0081.LDC2009T13	About 100 residences outside the towns of Mariposa and Midpines along Highway 140 remained off limits, but fire officials expressed hope that people who live there could return soon.
15304	LTW_ENG_20080801.0081.LDC2009T13	"I think we are feeling good," said Suzanne Grin, a U.S. Forest Service spokeswoman.
15305	LTW_ENG_20080801.0081.LDC2009T13	Nearly 4,500 firefighters continued to battle the Telegraph fire, which claimed 21 homes and displaced thousands after it erupted a week ago, ignited by a resident taking target practice near the Merced River.
15306	LTW_ENG_20080801.0081.LDC2009T13	Grin said the blaze was 40 percent contained Thursday morning.
15307	LTW_ENG_20080801.0081.LDC2009T13	But authorities hoped that number would rise as the day wore on and firefighters battled the last stubborn flames on the north side of the nearly 34,000-acre fire.
15308	LTW_ENG_20080801.0081.LDC2009T13	The most threatened areas are the web of rural neighborhoods arching down Greeley Hill along Highway 120.
15309	LTW_ENG_20080801.0081.LDC2009T13	More than two dozen helicopters and aerial tankers have been dropping retardant on the northern edge of the fire while hand crews and bulldozers constructed firebreaks and prepared for possible back burns to halt the flames' advance.
15310	LTW_ENG_20080801.0081.LDC2009T13	Firefighters also have prevented the blaze from turning east and heading farther up the Merced River canyon toward the town of El Portal, which houses administrative buildings for Yosemite National Park.
15311	LTW_ENG_20080801.0081.LDC2009T13	The fire was eight miles from the town and a dozen miles from the park's western entrance on Highway 140.
15312	LTW_ENG_20080801.0081.LDC2009T13	Adrienne Freeman, a park spokeswoman, said smoke that poured into Yosemite Valley during the early days of the blaze has largely dissipated and all air quality warnings have been lifted.
15313	LTW_ENG_20080801.0081.LDC2009T13	But with power lines into the park cut off by the fire, parts of the valley remain without electricity while other buildings, such as the visitor's center, are running on diesel-powered generators.
15314	LTW_ENG_20080801.0081.LDC2009T13	Freeman said there is no estimate when repairs to the power lines will be complete.
15315	LTW_ENG_20080801.0081.LDC2009T13	"It's just the reality of the whole situation," she said.
15316	LTW_ENG_20080801.0081.LDC2009T13	"People are dealing with it well.
15317	LTW_ENG_20080801.0081.LDC2009T13	We've had an enormous incident downstream, and we're adapting."
15318	LTW_ENG_20080801.0081.LDC2009T13	The only other hitch for Yosemite visitors has been occasional road closures along Highway 140, the major entrance to the park, when firefighters were working.
15319	LTW_ENG_20080803.0030.LDC2009T13	Anthrax Victims Reflect on Possible Resolution of the Case
15320	LTW_ENG_20080803.0030.LDC2009T13	WASHINGTON
15321	LTW_ENG_20080803.0030.LDC2009T13	There are times, especially when he's struggling to walk uphill, that Leroy Richmond can almost feel the anthrax that nearly killed him in 2001.
15322	LTW_ENG_20080803.0030.LDC2009T13	He senses how it saps his 64-year-old body of strength, how it forces him to rest for two or three minutes.
15323	LTW_ENG_20080803.0030.LDC2009T13	And now with reports that government scientist Bruce E. Ivins, who died last week of an apparent suicide, has been linked by authorities to the anthrax attacks, Richmond has another feeling.
15324	LTW_ENG_20080803.0030.LDC2009T13	He feels like this is the end of the mystery.
15325	LTW_ENG_20080803.0030.LDC2009T13	"I am totally relieved.
15326	LTW_ENG_20080803.0030.LDC2009T13	This brings a lot of closure," said Richmond, a former Washington, D.C., postal worker who retired after the 2001 attacks.
15327	LTW_ENG_20080803.0030.LDC2009T13	"It may not have brought the closure that others may have wanted, to see this person face justice as opposed to take his own life ... but I think they have the right person."
15328	LTW_ENG_20080803.0030.LDC2009T13	Authorities were preparing to file criminal charges against Ivins, 62, a scientist at the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases at Fort Detrick, Md., when he died Tuesday of a massive dose of prescription medication.
15329	LTW_ENG_20080803.0030.LDC2009T13	The U.S. Justice Department said Friday there had been "significant developments in the investigation," but declined to comment on the focus on Ivins, which was first reported by the Los Angeles Times Thursday.
15330	LTW_ENG_20080803.0030.LDC2009T13	Documents in the case are under court seal, and a department spokesman said Saturday there were no plans to ask a judge to unseal them this weekend.
15331	LTW_ENG_20080803.0030.LDC2009T13	Victims of the anthrax attacks, which killed five people, expressed mixed emotions to the case's surprising developments.
15332	LTW_ENG_20080803.0030.LDC2009T13	Richmond's certainty was offset by the wait-and-see attitude of Mary Morris, whose husband, Thomas Morris Jr., died from the lethal powder that seeped out of letters processed at the postal facility where he and Richmond worked.
15333	LTW_ENG_20080803.0030.LDC2009T13	And the lawyer for the family of another victim, Bob Stevens, said they felt both vindicated at the apparent confirmation of their belief that a government biodefense worker was behind the attacks, and suspicious that Ivins might be a fall-guy in a bungled investigation.
15334	LTW_ENG_20080803.0030.LDC2009T13	"He fits the profile that we had advanced, but they would like to see the evidence," said Richard D. Schuler, of West Palm Beach, Fla.
15335	LTW_ENG_20080803.0030.LDC2009T13	He has filed a lawsuit, pending in the Florida Supreme Court, seeking damages from the government for the wife and three children of Stevens, a photo editor for the Sun tabloid, who died after inhaling anthrax sent to the Boca Raton, Fla., offices of American Media Inc.
15336	LTW_ENG_20080803.0030.LDC2009T13	"The family definitely wants to be able to see the evidence that the FBI has accumulated, that they're not just trying to make this guy a scapegoat ... allowing them to close their file and be done with it," Schuler said.
15337	LTW_ENG_20080803.0030.LDC2009T13	The Times reported Saturday that Ivins was listed as the co- inventor on two patents for an anthrax vaccine and stood to gain financially from federal spending on vaccines in the aftermath of the deadly anthrax attacks.
15338	LTW_ENG_20080803.0030.LDC2009T13	But Morris, who now lives in Beach Park, Ill., said she still wasn't ready to jump to any conclusions.
15339	LTW_ENG_20080803.0030.LDC2009T13	"I am just like Joe Friday.
15340	LTW_ENG_20080803.0030.LDC2009T13	He said, `Just the facts.
15341	LTW_ENG_20080803.0030.LDC2009T13	Just the facts,'" Morris said.
15342	LTW_ENG_20080803.0030.LDC2009T13	"So we gather the facts and then we ponder the facts and ... we just wait and see what develops."
15343	LTW_ENG_20080803.0030.LDC2009T13	Although the death of her husband is with her every day, she said she forgives whoever was responsible.
15344	LTW_ENG_20080803.0030.LDC2009T13	She also feels for Ivins family.
15345	LTW_ENG_20080803.0030.LDC2009T13	"My head and my heart (say) that saying anything detrimental, unkind toward this man only hurts his family because they're the ones left to sort through and to wade through all of this," Morris said.
15346	LTW_ENG_20080803.0030.LDC2009T13	"We have to remember they lost someone they loved also."
15347	LTW_ENG_20080803.0030.LDC2009T13	Richmond, of Stafford, Va., said a money motive sounds "plausible."
15348	LTW_ENG_20080803.0030.LDC2009T13	But he would like to hear details of the case from the authorities.
15349	LTW_ENG_20080803.0030.LDC2009T13	In the meantime, Richmond deals with the fatigue and short-term memory loss he said the anthrax still causes him.
15350	LTW_ENG_20080803.0030.LDC2009T13	But until the recent reports, he thought about the attacks only when he felt the lingering physical affects.
15351	LTW_ENG_20080803.0030.LDC2009T13	"Those are the only times when I consider the fact that this is not normal," he said.
15352	LTW_ENG_20080803.0030.LDC2009T13	"This is not the type of person I was seven years (ago)."
15353	LTW_ENG_20080803.0030.LDC2009T13	Richmond said he talked with his friend Morris on the phone Friday, praying together and reflecting on a past they know cannot be changed by any new investigative developments.
15354	LTW_ENG_20080803.0030.LDC2009T13	"This is like the final chapter," he said.
15355	LTW_ENG_20080803.0030.LDC2009T13	"This is the like the end for us."
15356	LTW_ENG_20080904.0127.LDC2009T13	U.S. Troops Entered Pakistan, Officials Say
15357	LTW_ENG_20080904.0127.LDC2009T13	Helicopters carried U.S. and Afghan commandos many miles into Pakistan on Wednesday to stage the first U.S. ground attack against a Taliban target inside the country, Pakistani officials said Wednesday.
15358	LTW_ENG_20080904.0127.LDC2009T13	At least 20 local people died in the raid, according to the officials.
15359	LTW_ENG_20080904.0127.LDC2009T13	Pakistan filed a formal protest with the U.S. government, which had no comment on what appeared to be a new escalation of U.S. pressure on Taliban and al-Qaida sanctuaries in Pakistan's mountainous border regions.
15360	LTW_ENG_20080904.0127.LDC2009T13	As the Taliban insurgency escalates in Afghanistan, U.S. officials have increasingly turned their attention to those havens.
15361	LTW_ENG_20080904.0127.LDC2009T13	Pakistan has committed to securing the borders, but has been beset with rising violence, both in the frontier region and in its cities.
15362	LTW_ENG_20080904.0127.LDC2009T13	In another example of eroding security, the limousine of Pakistani Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gillani was ambushed Wednesday in the capital, Islamabad.
15363	LTW_ENG_20080904.0127.LDC2009T13	Two bullets struck the side window of his black Mercedes Benz as it sped toward an airport.
15364	LTW_ENG_20080904.0127.LDC2009T13	Gillani was not in the vehicle at the time.
15365	LTW_ENG_20080904.0127.LDC2009T13	U.S. forces based in Afghanistan have periodically conducted air and artillery strikes against insurgents across the border in Pakistani territory and new hot-pursuit rules provide some room for American troops to maneuver during battle.
15366	LTW_ENG_20080904.0127.LDC2009T13	But the arrival of U.S. helicopters in the village of Musa Nika, deep in undisputed Pakistani territory, would constitute a new tactic.
15367	LTW_ENG_20080904.0127.LDC2009T13	Mohammed Sadiq, a spokesman for Pakistan's Foreign Ministry, condemned a "gross violation of Pakistan's territory" and "a grave provocation."
15368	LTW_ENG_20080904.0127.LDC2009T13	In a written statement, he said his office lodged a formal complaint with the U.S. Embassy in Islamabad.
15369	LTW_ENG_20080904.0127.LDC2009T13	"Such actions are counterproductive and certainly do not help our joint efforts to fight terrorism," Sadiq said.
15370	LTW_ENG_20080904.0127.LDC2009T13	"On the contrary, they undermine the very basis of cooperation and may fuel the fire of hatred and violence that we are trying to extinguish."
15371	LTW_ENG_20080904.0127.LDC2009T13	U.S. military officials in Afghanistan, at the Central Command in Tampa and at the Pentagon maintained a wall of silence, saying they had no comment on the Pakistani reports.
15372	LTW_ENG_20080904.0127.LDC2009T13	Lou Fintor, a U.S. Embassy spokesman in Islamabad, also declined to comment.
15373	LTW_ENG_20080904.0127.LDC2009T13	Pakistani sources gave varying accounts, including on the number of troops and helicopters involved, and on whether U.S. troops were among those who left the helicopters and conducted a ground operation in the village.
15374	LTW_ENG_20080904.0127.LDC2009T13	There were also differing versions of how far inside Pakistan the helicopters flew, because the border's location is disputed.
15375	LTW_ENG_20080904.0127.LDC2009T13	By one count, the target village lay about 20 miles from the border.
15376	LTW_ENG_20080904.0127.LDC2009T13	According to Pakistani military sources, the raid began about 3 a.m. Wednesday when two or possibly three U.S. Army helicopters carrying American and Afghan troops landed in Musa Nika village in the Pakistani tribal area of South Waziristan.
15377	LTW_ENG_20080904.0127.LDC2009T13	The raid was apparently in response to a rocket that fighters fired at a convoy inside Afghanistan, according to one senior Pakistani official.
15378	LTW_ENG_20080904.0127.LDC2009T13	"By the time they got there," the official said, "the guy with the rocket had moved."
15379	LTW_ENG_20080904.0127.LDC2009T13	According to another Pakistani official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he is not authorized to give out information, several of the troops left the helicopters and launched an assault on three houses.
15380	LTW_ENG_20080904.0127.LDC2009T13	One of the homes belonged to local tribesman Pao Jan Ahmedzai Wazir, according to Anwar Shah, a resident of a neighboring village.
15381	LTW_ENG_20080904.0127.LDC2009T13	Several women and children who were inside Wazir's house and two other homes nearby were killed when U.S. and Afghan troops fired on the buildings, he said.
15382	LTW_ENG_20080904.0127.LDC2009T13	"The situation there is very terrible.
15383	LTW_ENG_20080904.0127.LDC2009T13	People are trying to take out the dead bodies," Shah said.
15384	LTW_ENG_20080904.0127.LDC2009T13	The reported attack comes at a time of debate over the rules of military operation along the 1,500 mile border between Afghanistan and Pakistan.
15385	LTW_ENG_20080904.0127.LDC2009T13	The Pakistani military appears to have acceded to U.S. pressure to step up attacks on extremists in its border areas.
15386	LTW_ENG_20080904.0127.LDC2009T13	In the past two months, it has launched major offensives on Taliban and al- Qaida strongholds in two of the country's Federally Administered Tribal Areas.
15387	LTW_ENG_20080904.0127.LDC2009T13	Analysts in Islamabad say that the incursion into South Waziristan could augur a tactical turn aimed at cutting off an insurgency that threatens to engulf large swaths of Pakistan and reverse gains made by U.S. and NATO forces in Afghanistan.
15388	LTW_ENG_20080904.0127.LDC2009T13	The Pentagon has never acknowledged a case of hot pursuit into Pakistan.
15389	LTW_ENG_20080904.0127.LDC2009T13	Wednesday's incident "doesn't fit that bill," the senior Pakistani official said.
15390	LTW_ENG_20080904.0127.LDC2009T13	There was no indication U.S. forces had begun a ground pursuit inside Afghanistan that led them into Pakistani territory.
15391	LTW_ENG_20080904.0127.LDC2009T13	A Pakistani military liaison unit at the main U.S. military base in Afghanistan, Bagram, is under military procedures to be informed of any incursion.
15392	LTW_ENG_20080904.0127.LDC2009T13	Pakistani officials insist there was no such notification.
15393	LTW_ENG_20080904.0127.LDC2009T13	Last week, Adm. Michael Mullen, chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, held a meeting with the Pakistani army chief, Gen. Ashfaq Kiyani, aboard a U.S. aircraft carrier in the Indian Ocean after several serious setbacks for Western and Afghan forces in Afghanistan.
15394	LTW_ENG_20080904.0127.LDC2009T13	U.S. and Pakistani officials have released few details about the meeting, which was also attended by Gen. David McKiernan, NATO's top commander in Afghanistan.
15395	LTW_ENG_20080904.0127.LDC2009T13	But a senior Pakistani military official with knowledge of the meeting said that Mullen and Kiyani focused in large part on the threat to international forces in Afghanistan emanating from insurgents operating inside Pakistan's borders.
15396	LTW_ENG_20080904.0127.LDC2009T13	The Pakistani military official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the meeting touched on a possible agreement to allow U.S. Special Forces to begin ground operations in Pakistan's tribal areas.
15397	LTW_ENG_20080904.0127.LDC2009T13	Maj. Gen. Athar Abbas, chief spokesman for the Pakistani military, denied that there was any agreement for U.S. troops to operate on Pakistani territory.
15398	LTW_ENG_20080904.0127.LDC2009T13	A NATO spokesman in Afghanistan said foreign forces are generally prohibited from mounting cross-border attacks into Pakistan.
15399	LTW_ENG_20080904.0127.LDC2009T13	The spokesman, who gave his name only as Sgt. Yates, said NATO forces occasionally use artillery or missiles to target insurgents who attack foreign troops from Pakistani territory, but the rules of engagement are very precise.
15400	LTW_ENG_20080904.0127.LDC2009T13	"Our area of operations stops at the border.
15401	LTW_ENG_20080904.0127.LDC2009T13	We don't go over the border, period," Yates said.
15402	LTW_ENG_20080904.0127.LDC2009T13	In Afghanistan, NATO and U.S. military operations have recently come under scrutiny because of an airstrike that Afghan and U.N. officials said killed up to 90 civilians two weeks ago.
15403	LTW_ENG_20080904.0127.LDC2009T13	On Wednesday, McKiernan said that he concurred with a U.S. military investigation that found that five civilians died in the incident.
15404	LTW_ENG_20080904.0127.LDC2009T13	McKiernan expressed sorrow at the loss of civilian lives in the strike, which began late on Aug. 21 in the village of Azizabad and continued into the early morning hours of Aug. 22.
15405	LTW_ENG_20080904.0127.LDC2009T13	He said NATO would work to better coordinate with the Afghan government and the U.N. mission in Afghanistan to respond to incidents involving civilian casualties.

15409	LTW_ENG_20080916.0003.LDC2009T13	Pension of Disbelief
15410	LTW_ENG_20080916.0003.LDC2009T13	The following editorial appeared in Monday's Washington Post:
15411	LTW_ENG_20080916.0003.LDC2009T13	As you might expect, the subject of a recent American Academy of Actuaries forum was rather technical: the standards that state and local pension plans use to determine how much to invest to keep their retirement promises to government workers.
15412	LTW_ENG_20080916.0003.LDC2009T13	While eye- glazing, this topic is critically important to state and local taxpayers because some of them may get stuck with an unexpected pension bill unless the actuaries, and the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB), which will receive their recommendations, take a stand for accuracy and full disclosure.
15413	LTW_ENG_20080916.0003.LDC2009T13	As The Washington Post reported this month, state and local government pension plans, unlike many private-sector plans, are allowed to calculate the adequacy of their funding based on relatively rosy projections about their earnings.
15414	LTW_ENG_20080916.0003.LDC2009T13	Instead of assuming a rate of return pegged to the lowest-risk investment, a 30-year Treasury bond (currently about 4 percent), they typically use a benchmark of 8 percent, which implies that they will do very well for very long periods in the riskier stock and bond markets.
15415	LTW_ENG_20080916.0003.LDC2009T13	How likely is that?
15416	LTW_ENG_20080916.0003.LDC2009T13	As Berkshire Hathaway Chairman Warren E. Buffett (a member of The Washington Post Co.'s board) noted in a recent letter to his shareholders, the Dow Jones industrial average, currently hovering around 11,000, would have to hit about 2,000,000 by the end of this century just to match the 5.3 percent annual rate of return stocks yielded in the last one.
15417	LTW_ENG_20080916.0003.LDC2009T13	Now, we have nothing against optimism, but in this case, it permits state and local officials to make sweet promises -- high benefits, low retirement ages -- to civil servants without having to raise the funds that might actually be necessary to keep them.
15418	LTW_ENG_20080916.0003.LDC2009T13	This may not be good policy, but it's good politics since officials who make unrealistic commitments usually aren't around when they come due.
15419	LTW_ENG_20080916.0003.LDC2009T13	To be sure, most pension funds are financially sound: 58 percent, according to a recent study by the Government Accountability Office.
15420	LTW_ENG_20080916.0003.LDC2009T13	Even those that are underfunded are still meeting current obligations.
15421	LTW_ENG_20080916.0003.LDC2009T13	Unlike private firms, governments probably should not accumulate surpluses in their pension funds because that creates political pressure to raid the excess for spending.
15422	LTW_ENG_20080916.0003.LDC2009T13	And, unlike private firms, governments generally do not go bankrupt.
15423	LTW_ENG_20080916.0003.LDC2009T13	Still, it's not impossible.
15424	LTW_ENG_20080916.0003.LDC2009T13	The city of Vallejo, Calif., declared bankruptcy in May, partly because it had granted police and firefighters six-figure pensions that kicked in at age 50.
15425	LTW_ENG_20080916.0003.LDC2009T13	The U.S. population is aging, and long-term inflation is a fact of life.
15426	LTW_ENG_20080916.0003.LDC2009T13	The actuaries and the GASB should urge state and local governments to play by more cautious -- and more transparent -- rules.
15427	LTW_ENG_20080916.0003.LDC2009T13	For taxpayers trying to understand their governments' true pension liabilities, the best surprise is no surprise.
15428	LTW_ENG_20080924.0132.LDC2009T13	Lawsuit Says Auto Club Imposes Battery Sales Quotas (Los Angeles)
15429	LTW_ENG_20080924.0132.LDC2009T13	LOS ANGELES
15430	LTW_ENG_20080924.0132.LDC2009T13	Members of the Automobile Club of Southern California who call for roadside help when they have a dead battery often are sold new batteries when only a jump start is needed, a lawsuit filed Tuesday alleges.
15431	LTW_ENG_20080924.0132.LDC2009T13	The lawsuit, filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court, alleges that the Auto Club imposes a quota system regarding battery sales on the tow truck operators who answer roadside assistance calls placed by club members.
15432	LTW_ENG_20080924.0132.LDC2009T13	Auto Club tow-truck drivers who fail to meet their quota risk losing "valuable future customers," the suit contends, and operators who exceed their quotas are paid unspecified incentives.
15433	LTW_ENG_20080924.0132.LDC2009T13	The suit, which seeks class-action status, was filed on behalf of L.A.-area resident Paul Martin Davis-Miller.
15434	LTW_ENG_20080924.0132.LDC2009T13	According to the suit, Miller called the Auto Club earlier this year when his car wouldn't start.
15435	LTW_ENG_20080924.0132.LDC2009T13	The tow truck operator who answered the call sold him a new battery that cost him about $125.
15436	LTW_ENG_20080924.0132.LDC2009T13	"However, subsequent tests of the purportedly `dead' battery have established that the replaced battery was fully functional and able to hold a full charge," according to the suit.
15437	LTW_ENG_20080924.0132.LDC2009T13	A spokesman for the Auto Club, which has more than 6 million members, said he hadn't seen the suit and couldn't comment on the allegations.
15438	LTW_ENG_20080924.0132.LDC2009T13	In 2001, the Auto Club launched a new program in which tow truck operators could replace batteries at the scene of a breakdown rather than simply tow the vehicle to a repair facility.
15439	LTW_ENG_20080924.0132.LDC2009T13	The service has been popular with members, said David Lang, the Auto Club's vice president of automotive services.
15440	LTW_ENG_20080924.0132.LDC2009T13	The Auto Club gets about 4 million calls a year for roadside assistance, including dead batteries, lockouts and motorists who run out of gas.
15441	LTW_ENG_20080924.0132.LDC2009T13	San Francisco attorney William Audet, who filed the lawsuit, said the number of victims could run into the thousands.
15442	LTW_ENG_20080924.0132.LDC2009T13	The suit seeks repayment of money allegedly paid for fraudulently replaced batteries as well as unspecified punitive damages.

15444	LTW_ENG_20080927.0058.LDC2009T13	MOSCOW
15445	LTW_ENG_20080927.0058.LDC2009T13	Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez was feted here Friday with what are emerging as the trademark tokens of Russian favor: oil and gas deals, the promise of nuclear cooperation and, most significant, a $1-billion loan to buy weapons.
15446	LTW_ENG_20080927.0058.LDC2009T13	Moscow agreed to lend Venezuela money to buy a wide range of Russian weaponry and hardware, said a source in the Kremlin who spoke on condition of anonymity.
15447	LTW_ENG_20080927.0058.LDC2009T13	Reminiscent of Soviet loans to anti-American Cold War allies, the deal is one of a number gradually binding the two oil-rich, anti-Western governments into tight cooperation.
15448	LTW_ENG_20080927.0058.LDC2009T13	Russia has gone out of its way to show off its burgeoning friendship with the Latin American leader.
15449	LTW_ENG_20080927.0058.LDC2009T13	Analysts suggest that Moscow prizes Venezuela almost solely for its proximity to, and hostility toward, the United States.
15450	LTW_ENG_20080927.0058.LDC2009T13	Russia has been enraged by U.S. support for NATO membership for former Soviet states such as Ukraine and Georgia, and well as U.S. plans to build anti-missile facilities in nearby Poland and the Czech Republic.
15451	LTW_ENG_20080927.0058.LDC2009T13	If the United States pressures Moscow in the former Soviet bloc, the Russian elite has long believed, then why shouldn't Russia exert its influence closer to American borders?
15452	LTW_ENG_20080927.0058.LDC2009T13	"Latin America is becoming a noticeable link in the whole chain of the emerging multipolar world," Prime Minister Vladimir V. Putin said during meetings with Chavez.
15453	LTW_ENG_20080927.0058.LDC2009T13	"This is obvious, and we will pay more and more attention to this area."
15454	LTW_ENG_20080927.0058.LDC2009T13	Russia sent a pair of strategic bombers to Venezuela earlier this month for training exercises.
15455	LTW_ENG_20080927.0058.LDC2009T13	"Russian soldiers, officers and generals made the best impression on our people," Chavez enthused during his meeting with Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, according to Interfax.
15456	LTW_ENG_20080927.0058.LDC2009T13	"We were filled with admiration."
15457	LTW_ENG_20080927.0058.LDC2009T13	In late November, Russia is expected to dispatch warships, including a nuclear-powered cruiser, into Venezuela's waters for exercises.
15458	LTW_ENG_20080927.0058.LDC2009T13	Some analysts have dismissed Russia's interest in Venezuela as little more than an effort to battle a perception of international isolation.
15459	LTW_ENG_20080927.0058.LDC2009T13	"This reflects a desperate search for partners and a desperate search for allies that can create the impression that Russia occupies some kind of political galaxy," said Lilia Shevtsova, a senior associate at the Carnegie Moscow Center.
15460	LTW_ENG_20080927.0058.LDC2009T13	"Unfortunately, it's not only Chavez but Belarus, Hamas and Hezbollah.
15461	LTW_ENG_20080927.0058.LDC2009T13	It's not very civilized company."
15462	LTW_ENG_20080927.0058.LDC2009T13	Russia's crushing military intervention in Georgia this summer roundly was criticized by the West as disproportionate.
15463	LTW_ENG_20080927.0058.LDC2009T13	And even nations that seemed neutral toward or supportive of Russia's actions have balked at joining Moscow in recognizing the independence of Georgia's two separatist republics, South Ossetia and Abkhazia.
15464	LTW_ENG_20080927.0058.LDC2009T13	Chavez, too, carefully avoided recognizing the rebel regions.
15465	LTW_ENG_20080927.0058.LDC2009T13	"We know well what caused the conflict, who attacked the South Ossetians and how," he said.
15466	LTW_ENG_20080927.0058.LDC2009T13	"We once again express our complete and firm support for your actions."
15467	LTW_ENG_20080927.0058.LDC2009T13	In recent years, his country has ordered more than $3 billion of Russian weapons and military hardware, including helicopters, missile defense systems and dozens of fighter jets.
15468	LTW_ENG_20080927.0058.LDC2009T13	Russia has also sold Venezuela some 100,000 Kalashnikov rifles and started work on two local plants to manufacture the guns in Venezuela, Interfax reported.
15469	LTW_ENG_20080927.0058.LDC2009T13	During Friday's meetings, Putin also said that Russia was ready to cooperate with Venezuela on nuclear energy.
15470	LTW_ENG_20080927.0058.LDC2009T13	Meanwhile, the Venezuelan and Russian energy ministries signed a memorandum of understanding that sets out plans for a consortium among their major oil and gas companies.
15471	LTW_ENG_20080927.0058.LDC2009T13	The deal would give Russian companies greater access to Venezuelan fields.
15472	LTW_ENG_20080927.0058.LDC2009T13	Venezuela would reap billions of dollars in Russian investments.
15473	LTW_ENG_20080927.0058.LDC2009T13	"We are, luckily, ahead of the world financial crisis," Chavez said.
15474	LTW_ENG_20080927.0058.LDC2009T13	"It will not get us."

15476	LTW_ENG_20080930.0121.LDC2009T13	McCain and Obama Trade Barbs over Failed Bailout Plan
15477	LTW_ENG_20080930.0121.LDC2009T13	COLUMBUS, Ohio--John McCain, calling himself a man of action like his hero, Teddy Roosevelt, told a raucous crowd here Monday that he had helped lead the charge to pass the Wall Street rescue plan.
15478	LTW_ENG_20080930.0121.LDC2009T13	"I've never been afraid of stepping in to solve problems for the American people," McCain said to cheers and applause.
15479	LTW_ENG_20080930.0121.LDC2009T13	Two hours later, the bailout plan that McCain had boasted of working for went down to defeat in the House, with McCain's fellow Republicans siding soundly against it.
15480	LTW_ENG_20080930.0121.LDC2009T13	As the stock market plummeted on the news, McCain was forced to make a second and far more sober statement defending his work on the rescue plan.
15481	LTW_ENG_20080930.0121.LDC2009T13	"I worked hard to play a constructive role in bringing everyone to the table," he said to news reporters gathered at his next campaign stop, in Iowa.
15482	LTW_ENG_20080930.0121.LDC2009T13	He said he had helped shape the bill to lessen the risk to taxpayers.
15483	LTW_ENG_20080930.0121.LDC2009T13	The failure of the rescue plan in the House, and the stock market losses that followed, presented a challenge to both major presidential candidates, who cautiously had supported the plan and had attended a high-profile meeting with President Bush last week designed to advance a deal on the legislation.
15484	LTW_ENG_20080930.0121.LDC2009T13	After the plan failed Monday, each candidate urged Congress to try again and called for a renewed spirit of bipartisanship--even while the two campaigns traded blame and barbs.
15485	LTW_ENG_20080930.0121.LDC2009T13	Although Barack Obama, who was campaigning in the suburbs of Denver, said no one person was at fault in the financial crisis and that there was a "lot of blame to spread around," he urged voters to consider McCain's record of favoring deregulation of the nation's financial markets as they weighed which candidate would best steer the nation's economic "ship into port."
15486	LTW_ENG_20080930.0121.LDC2009T13	"With so much at stake -- with our economy at risk, our children's future in the balance -- the greatest risk in this election is to repeat the same mistakes of the past," Obama said.
15487	LTW_ENG_20080930.0121.LDC2009T13	"We can't take a chance on that same losing game."
15488	LTW_ENG_20080930.0121.LDC2009T13	McCain also called for bipartisanship, yet he criticized his Democratic rival.
15489	LTW_ENG_20080930.0121.LDC2009T13	"Senator Obama and his allies in Congress infused unnecessary partisanship into the process," McCain said, referring to the failed House vote.
15490	LTW_ENG_20080930.0121.LDC2009T13	He continued: "Now is not the time to fix the blame
15491	LTW_ENG_20080930.0121.LDC2009T13	it's time to fix the problem."
15492	LTW_ENG_20080930.0121.LDC2009T13	McCain's campaign went further, with senior policy adviser Doug Holtz-Eakin placing the blame for the bailout's failure squarely on the Democratic presidential candidate and his party.
15493	LTW_ENG_20080930.0121.LDC2009T13	"This bill failed because Barack Obama and the Democrats put politics ahead of country," he said.
15494	LTW_ENG_20080930.0121.LDC2009T13	Obama spokesman Bill Burton characterized the statements as "angry and hyper-partisan" and said they were "exactly why the American people are disgusted with Washington."
15495	LTW_ENG_20080930.0121.LDC2009T13	The candidates spent Monday rallying voters in the battleground states of Ohio and Colorado, which have a combined 29 electoral votes.
15496	LTW_ENG_20080930.0121.LDC2009T13	Bush carried both in 2004, but polls show they will be tight races in November.
15497	LTW_ENG_20080930.0121.LDC2009T13	McCain's running mate, Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, accompanied him to the Columbus rally before traveling to Arizona, where she will prepare for the vice presidential debate Thursday in St. Louis.
15498	LTW_ENG_20080930.0121.LDC2009T13	Palin said that she looked forward to debating Democrat Sen. Joe Biden, whom she has not met.
15499	LTW_ENG_20080930.0121.LDC2009T13	"But I've been hearing about his speeches since I was in the second grade," she quipped.

15503	LTW_ENG_20081006.0018.LDC2009T13	Taiwanese President Ma Ying-jeou on Saturday welcomed U.S. plans to sell the island almost $6.5 billion in weaponry, a move that appeared to repair years of frayed ties between Taiwan and the administration.
15504	LTW_ENG_20081006.0018.LDC2009T13	The Pentagon's Defense Security Cooperation Agency said in a statement released Friday that it had notified Congress about the sale, which marks Taiwan's first purchase of the Patriot Advanced Capability-3 surface-to-air guided missile defense system.
15505	LTW_ENG_20081006.0018.LDC2009T13	"We think this announcement from the U.S. government is a sign that the past eight years of discord are over," Ma said in a statement.
15506	LTW_ENG_20081006.0018.LDC2009T13	The sale serves as a reminder that the Taiwan Strait remains one of Asia's potential flash points.
15507	LTW_ENG_20081006.0018.LDC2009T13	China regards Taiwan as a renegade province with no right to a sovereign government and has threatened to invade in response to any moves toward independence.
15508	LTW_ENG_20081006.0018.LDC2009T13	The United States, under the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act, has pledged to help Taiwan defend itself against any unprovoked Chinese attack.
15509	LTW_ENG_20081006.0018.LDC2009T13	The weapons sale, which also includes Apache helicopters and Harpoon missiles, comes as Taiwanese negotiators are working behind the scenes with China to arrange a visit by Chen Yunlin, the head of China's semiofficial agency negotiating with Taiwan, at the end of the month or in November.
15510	LTW_ENG_20081006.0018.LDC2009T13	Chen would be the highest-ranking Chinese official to visit Taiwan since the Nationalists relocated to the island in 1949.
15511	LTW_ENG_20081006.0018.LDC2009T13	Ma, who was elected in March on a platform of detente with China, said Saturday that he still wants to develop cross-strait ties, and analysts said the sale was unlikely to derail Chen's visit.
15512	LTW_ENG_20081006.0018.LDC2009T13	George Tsai, a political scientist at Taipei's Chinese Culture University, said, "I think they understand the realities.
15513	LTW_ENG_20081006.0018.LDC2009T13	I don't think this will upset Chen Yunlin's visit."
15514	LTW_ENG_20081006.0018.LDC2009T13	The package was proposed by the U.S. government in 2001.
15515	LTW_ENG_20081006.0018.LDC2009T13	But lawmakers from Ma's Nationalist Party, who were in the opposition at the time, refused to approve procurement budgets for several years, saying the purchase was too costly.
15516	LTW_ENG_20081006.0018.LDC2009T13	After Taiwan finally approved the funding, senior U.S. officials placed a de facto freeze on arms sales to Taiwan for almost a year, observers said, because they were irritated by the wrangling and because they needed China's help in resolving international issues, such as persuading North Korea to relinquish nuclear weapons.
15517	LTW_ENG_20081006.0018.LDC2009T13	Since coming to power, Nationalist officials, including Ma, have worked at improving relations with the United States.
15518	LTW_ENG_20081006.0018.LDC2009T13	A Taiwanese defense official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said Taiwan would continue to lobby for two items omitted from the package: 60 Black Hawk utility helicopters and a feasibility study to build diesel-electric submarines.
15519	LTW_ENG_20081006.0018.LDC2009T13	Taiwan will also push the United States to sell it about 60 F-16 C/D fighters, the official said.
15520	LTW_ENG_20081006.0018.LDC2009T13	Andrew Yang, a military analyst with the Chinese Council of Advanced Policy Studies, said the sale, which the U.S. Congress must approve, was largely symbolic, because China has more than 1,000 missiles pointed at the island, and Taiwan's defensive capabilities remain limited.
15521	LTW_ENG_20081014.0111.LDC2009T13	McCain Stumps in Hampton Roads
15522	LTW_ENG_20081014.0111.LDC2009T13	Sen. John McCain and his running mate, Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, rallied thousands of enthusiastic supporters Monday in Hampton Roads, an increasingly crucial region in Virginia that had once been considered safe territory for the Republican presidential ticket but is now up for grabs.
15523	LTW_ENG_20081014.0111.LDC2009T13	McCain, R-Ariz., came to the heavily populated and racially diverse area to speak about the global economic crisis, U.S. troops serving in Iraq and Afghanistan, and his increasingly uphill battle to the presidency.
15524	LTW_ENG_20081014.0111.LDC2009T13	"Let me give you the state of the race today and some straight talk," McCain said.
15525	LTW_ENG_20081014.0111.LDC2009T13	"We have 22 days to go.
15526	LTW_ENG_20081014.0111.LDC2009T13	We're six points down.
15527	LTW_ENG_20081014.0111.LDC2009T13	The national media has written us off.
15528	LTW_ENG_20081014.0111.LDC2009T13	But they forgot to let you decide."
15529	LTW_ENG_20081014.0111.LDC2009T13	Monday's visit, three weeks before the Nov. 4 election, shows that the McCain campaign recognizes the area's importance to winning Virginia's 13 electoral votes.
15530	LTW_ENG_20081014.0111.LDC2009T13	It also demonstrates that the region, like the state as a whole, can no longer be considered a Republican stronghold.
15531	LTW_ENG_20081014.0111.LDC2009T13	The area, home to the world's largest naval base, will be one of the state's most competitive in the presidential race.
15532	LTW_ENG_20081014.0111.LDC2009T13	A Washington Post-ABC News poll late last month showed that 50 percent of likely voters in Hampton Roads favor the Democratic nominee, Sen. Barack Obama, D-Ill., and 45 percent back McCain.
15533	LTW_ENG_20081014.0111.LDC2009T13	"It's going to come right down to the wire here, and it's pretty clear that the road to victory in 2008 is going to run right through the Hampton Roads," Palin said.
15534	LTW_ENG_20081014.0111.LDC2009T13	Democrats expect Obama to win big in vote-rich Northern Virginia, while Republicans expect McCain to win the Shenandoah Valley and rural Southside and southwestern Virginia.
15535	LTW_ENG_20081014.0111.LDC2009T13	That means winning the state could come down to Hampton Roads.
15536	LTW_ENG_20081014.0111.LDC2009T13	The region is home to core constituencies for both parties.
15537	LTW_ENG_20081014.0111.LDC2009T13	It is composed of mid-size cities and sprawling suburbs where economic, military and social issues all come into play.
15538	LTW_ENG_20081014.0111.LDC2009T13	McCain, a Navy veteran who was once based at Naval Air Station Oceana in Virginia Beach, expects support from the half-million people connected with the military as well as the large evangelical population.
15539	LTW_ENG_20081014.0111.LDC2009T13	Obama, the first black presidential nominee on a major party ticket, expects support from the state's largest African-American population and thousands of college students.
15540	LTW_ENG_20081014.0111.LDC2009T13	"It's ground zero.
15541	LTW_ENG_20081014.0111.LDC2009T13	It comes down to Hampton Roads," said state Del.
15542	LTW_ENG_20081014.0111.LDC2009T13	John Cosgrove, R-Chesapeake, who was working as a volunteer at the rally.
15543	LTW_ENG_20081014.0111.LDC2009T13	"You can't look at Hampton Roads and say, `This is a Republican area and that is a Democratic area,' because it really is a mix."
15544	LTW_ENG_20081014.0111.LDC2009T13	The Virginia Beach Convention Center was filled with thousands of supporters wearing red shirts, sweaters, scarves and hats to symbolize their desire to prevent a Democrat from carrying the state for the first time in more than four decades.
15545	LTW_ENG_20081014.0111.LDC2009T13	The McCain campaign estimated the crowd at 25,000 people, but the local police and fire marshal put it closer to 12,000.
15546	LTW_ENG_20081014.0111.LDC2009T13	Supporters waved "Country First" signs and handmade posters with the words "I Have 4 Hockey Moms and 1 Joe Six Pack for McCain- Palin" and "Trig for First Baby," referring to Palin's youngest son.
15547	LTW_ENG_20081014.0111.LDC2009T13	Palin, by far, received the most cheers.
15548	LTW_ENG_20081014.0111.LDC2009T13	"Sar-ah!"
15549	LTW_ENG_20081014.0111.LDC2009T13	they chanted.
15550	LTW_ENG_20081014.0111.LDC2009T13	"Sar-ah!"
15551	LTW_ENG_20081014.0111.LDC2009T13	Hampton Roads, a sprawling area of 1.6 million people in 17 localities, includes the state's second-largest metropolitan area and largest city.
15552	LTW_ENG_20081014.0111.LDC2009T13	Virginia's southeastern corner has been a swing area in recent years, veering back and forth between Republicans and Democrats.
15553	LTW_ENG_20081014.0111.LDC2009T13	Republican Attorney General Robert McDonnell, who spoke at the rally, said he thinks McCain will win Hampton Roads, but he added that it was important for McCain to come to the area anyway to shore up the base.
15554	LTW_ENG_20081014.0111.LDC2009T13	"You have to energize your team," said McDonnell, who was wearing a red tie.
15555	LTW_ENG_20081014.0111.LDC2009T13	"You certainly don't want to take any part of the state for granted."
15556	LTW_ENG_20081014.0111.LDC2009T13	It was McCain's second trip to the battleground state since the Feb. 12 primary.
15557	LTW_ENG_20081014.0111.LDC2009T13	Later Monday, Palin attended a rally of about 25,000 at the Richmond International Raceway.
15558	LTW_ENG_20081014.0111.LDC2009T13	Obama has been to Virginia six times since securing the Democratic presidential nomination.
15559	LTW_ENG_20081014.0111.LDC2009T13	His running mate, Sen. Joe Biden, D-Del., and their wives have been to the state a total of eight times.
15560	LTW_ENG_20081014.0111.LDC2009T13	Five of the 14 trips were to Hampton Roads.
15561	LTW_ENG_20081014.0111.LDC2009T13	No Democratic presidential candidate has carried Virginia since 1964, but recent polls show Obama and McCain locked in an extremely competitive race in Virginia.
15562	LTW_ENG_20081014.0111.LDC2009T13	The Post-ABC News poll late last month indicated that Virginia's likely voters are divided 49 percent for Obama and 46 percent for McCain.
15563	LTW_ENG_20081014.0111.LDC2009T13	In response to McCain's visit, Obama's campaign held news conferences in Virginia Beach and Richmond, where Virginia veterans spoke of their concerns about McCain.

15565	LTW_ENG_20081014.0111.LDC2009T13	Joseph Bouchard, D-Virginia Beach , who spent almost three decades in the Navy, said demographic changes combined with discontent over Bush's veterans benefits policies have soured residents on McCain.
15566	LTW_ENG_20081014.0111.LDC2009T13	"They feel the Bush administration has let them down," he said.
15567	LTW_ENG_20081014.0111.LDC2009T13	"McCain has been in lockstep with Bush."

15569	LTW_ENG_20081018.0067.LDC2009T13	Great Educators: John Comer
15570	LTW_ENG_20081018.0067.LDC2009T13	James P. Comer, the child psychiatrist who pioneered research on raising student achievement among poor minorities via collaborating with parents and community services.
15571	LTW_ENG_20081018.0067.LDC2009T13	To educate the lowest achieving students (who are most often poor, in rural isolation, or from marginalized minorities), it will be necessary to turn traditional schooling on its conceptual head.
15572	LTW_ENG_20081018.0067.LDC2009T13	The current, mechanical, input-output model that pervades our schooling system and focuses immediately on curriculum, instruction, and assessment must be changed to a model that focuses primarily on relationships, creating a positive culture, and student development.
15573	LTW_ENG_20081018.0067.LDC2009T13	What reads like a slight difference is a huge and profound change in practice.
15574	LTW_ENG_20081018.0067.LDC2009T13	Development and learning are inextricably linked and take place through a critical dynamic: From birth caretakers interact with the young in ways that make emotional attachment and bonding possible.
15575	LTW_ENG_20081018.0067.LDC2009T13	Through this arrangement, as the young act on their environment to build their own survival and expressive capacities, they can imitate, identify with, and internalize the attitudes, values and life management styles of their meaningful caretakers.
15576	LTW_ENG_20081018.0067.LDC2009T13	Also, through this arrangement, caretakers can mediate the physical (including brain construction), psycho-emotional, moral- ethical, linguistic, cognitive-academic learning growth and development of children and students.
15577	LTW_ENG_20081018.0067.LDC2009T13	Most students from mainstream backgrounds -- regardless of their socioeconomic, racial or regional backgrounds -- experience this dynamic.
15578	LTW_ENG_20081018.0067.LDC2009T13	Children who do not come from mainstream backgrounds, or who have a non-mainstream experience, are more likely to be underdeveloped, or differently developed, and are less likely to be successful in school and in life.
15579	LTW_ENG_20081018.0067.LDC2009T13	Such children often lack the competencies, confidence and sense of belonging needed to perform well in school.
15580	LTW_ENG_20081018.0067.LDC2009T13	They often withhold or withdraw, or act in inappropriate ways as they sense failure in the school setting.
15581	LTW_ENG_20081018.0067.LDC2009T13	Nonetheless, many of these students are from vibrant and meaningful subcultures.
15582	LTW_ENG_20081018.0067.LDC2009T13	Their emotional attachment to kin, friends and the cultural organizations to which they feel they belong is very powerful.
15583	LTW_ENG_20081018.0067.LDC2009T13	Many of these students, even when making academic progress in school, may eventually be highly conflicted about or reject the mainstream school and life culture if there are no positive sanctions and there is no collaboration between home, school, and community.
15584	LTW_ENG_20081018.0067.LDC2009T13	Most teachers and administrators -- through no fault of their own -- are not prepared to create school cultures that create a sense of belonging, support student development, and positively sanction activities and behaviors that make success possible in school and in the mainstream of the society.
15585	LTW_ENG_20081018.0067.LDC2009T13	Student underdevelopment and staff under-preparation is the major reason that capable students are performing badly.
15586	LTW_ENG_20081018.0067.LDC2009T13	The way to change this is simple to state, but difficult to bring about.
15587	LTW_ENG_20081018.0067.LDC2009T13	The entire 3 to 4 million-person education workforce needs to create the kind of school culture that supports development, teaching, academic success and life preparation.
15588	LTW_ENG_20081018.0067.LDC2009T13	There is evidence that this can be done.
15589	LTW_ENG_20081018.0067.LDC2009T13	But leadership within each element of the education enterprise -- parents, teachers, school administrators, policymakers at every level and school staff preparatory programs -- must work collaboratively and synchronously to make it possible.
15590	LTW_ENG_20081018.0067.LDC2009T13	With a focus on the underlying problem, commitment to and an appropriate framework for change, it will be possible to educate all children well.
15591	LTW_ENG_20081104.0088.LDC2009T13	Iraq's Parliament Approves Governing Quotas
15592	LTW_ENG_20081104.0088.LDC2009T13	Also Monday, three bombs in Baghdad killed at least seven people, most of them at a busy square targeted by twin blasts that exploded seconds apart during morning rush hour.
15593	LTW_ENG_20081104.0088.LDC2009T13	Another bomb north of the capital killed one person and contributed to a day of violence that underscored the ongoing tensions in Iraq even as it enjoys a period of relative tranquillity.No date has been set for the provincial vote, but it is due to take place by Jan. 31 and has been heralded as key to undoing lopsided power structures blamed for fueling sectarian violence.
15594	LTW_ENG_20081104.0088.LDC2009T13	The minority quota formula approved by lawmakers would guarantee a total of six seats spread across three provincial councils to Christians and three smaller minority groups: Yazidis, Sabians and Shabaks.
15595	LTW_ENG_20081104.0088.LDC2009T13	Of the 150 lawmakers present, 106 voted for the plan.
15596	LTW_ENG_20081104.0088.LDC2009T13	It sets aside one seat for Christian parties on the provincial councils of Baghdad, Ninevah, and Basra.
15597	LTW_ENG_20081104.0088.LDC2009T13	Sabians, a pacifist religious sect, will also receive one seat in Baghdad.
15598	LTW_ENG_20081104.0088.LDC2009T13	Yazidis, from another religious sect, and Shabaks, an ethnic minority, will each have one seat on the Ninevah council.
15599	LTW_ENG_20081104.0088.LDC2009T13	Like Christians, the other groups have claimed persecution under the Shiite Muslim-led Iraqi government and demanded special protection when parliament in September passed the law setting the stage for provincial elections.
15600	LTW_ENG_20081104.0088.LDC2009T13	That law failed to include special considerations for parties representing minorities, prompting protests by Christian lawmakers and weeks of wrangling to come up with a solution acceptable to small groups and to the Shiite, Kurdish and Sunni Arab parties vying for dominance.
15601	LTW_ENG_20081104.0088.LDC2009T13	The approved quotas were less generous than those in two other proposals which would have granted a total of either eight or 12 seats to minority parties, and the choice illustrated the fears and distrust among lawmakers in heavily contested, ethnically mixed areas.
15602	LTW_ENG_20081104.0088.LDC2009T13	Ninevah, in northern Iraq, is particularly sensitive because of its mixed population largely composed of Sunni Arabs, Kurds, Christians and Yazidis.
15603	LTW_ENG_20081104.0088.LDC2009T13	Sunnis Arabs had resisted setting aside large minority quotas on the 37-seat provincial council, fearful that minority groups might lean toward the Kurds and bolster Kurdish hopes of expanding their influence in the north.
15604	LTW_ENG_20081104.0088.LDC2009T13	The 12-seat option rejected Monday would have set aside seven minority seats on the council.
15605	LTW_ENG_20081104.0088.LDC2009T13	Hassan Alaf, a Sunni Arab lawmaker, said the minorities will receive the number of seats they deserve based on their population in the region.
15606	LTW_ENG_20081104.0088.LDC2009T13	"The decision . . . was very fair," said Alaf.
15607	LTW_ENG_20081104.0088.LDC2009T13	"We believe granting one seat to each minority is pretty good and leaves decent room for the larger slates to compete fairly."
15608	LTW_ENG_20081104.0088.LDC2009T13	Alaf noted that Christian, Yazidi or other minority politicians could increase their voices in Ninevah by running for office under the banner of large political blocs.
15609	LTW_ENG_20081104.0088.LDC2009T13	That would guarantee them their guaranteed one-seat quota, plus more seats if they had enough public support, he said.
15610	LTW_ENG_20081104.0088.LDC2009T13	"This does not limit their participation or prevent them from nominating themselves in any slate," he said.
15611	LTW_ENG_20081104.0088.LDC2009T13	"This way, they can get more seats if they have a good number of votes."
15612	LTW_ENG_20081104.0088.LDC2009T13	But Christian lawmaker Younadem Kana denounced the vote as an "insult" and said it showed the "fanaticism and racism" of Arabs fearful of Kurdish influence.
15613	LTW_ENG_20081104.0088.LDC2009T13	He said Arabs had feared Christians would ally themselves with the Kurds and sought to sabotage this possibility by blocking the larger quotas.
15614	LTW_ENG_20081104.0088.LDC2009T13	Kurdish lawmakers said they had opposed the bill because it did not give Christians more guaranteed seats.
15615	LTW_ENG_20081104.0088.LDC2009T13	"The voting of today showed who is fighting the Christians and who is supporting them," said Arif Tayfur, a Kurdish political leader and parliamentarian.
15616	LTW_ENG_20081104.0088.LDC2009T13	The deal must be approved by the nation's three-member presidency council, and Kana said he would demand a veto.
15617	LTW_ENG_20081104.0088.LDC2009T13	Earlier this year, Kurds succeeded in putting plans for provincial elections on hold when President Jalal Talabani, a member of the presidency, vetoed an election bill that had passed parliament over Kurdish objections.
15618	LTW_ENG_20081104.0088.LDC2009T13	That forced a re-negotiation of the law and led to the version passed in September and tweaked in Monday's voting.
15619	LTW_ENG_20081104.0088.LDC2009T13	There was no indication the Christians could force another veto, although their bitter objections raise the specter of heightened tensions in the north, which is currently the country's most violent region.
15620	LTW_ENG_20081104.0088.LDC2009T13	The rest of Iraq has seen a sharp decline in bloodshed in recent months, but Monday's attacks showed the lingering instability.
15621	LTW_ENG_20081104.0088.LDC2009T13	The worst blasts occurred seconds apart in front of a police building in central Baghdad.
15622	LTW_ENG_20081104.0088.LDC2009T13	Six people were killed, including a 14-year-old boy.
15623	LTW_ENG_20081104.0088.LDC2009T13	Cars, shops and a restaurant were damaged, and the wounded included several police officers.
15624	LTW_ENG_20081104.0088.LDC2009T13	A roadside bomb in eastern Baghdad targeting an Iraqi police convoy killed one policeman.
15625	LTW_ENG_20081104.0088.LDC2009T13	In Baqouba, the capital of Diyala province north of Baghdad, a car bomb in the parking lot of the provincial council exploded, killing one policeman and wounding 10 people.

15635	LTW_ENG_20081114.0034.LDC2009T13	One floral arrangement consists simply of a pale-yellow dahlia floating in a Chinese bowl.
15636	LTW_ENG_20081114.0034.LDC2009T13	"Whether you're displaying merchandise in a store or objects in your home, it's important to give each object breathing room," Russell says.
15637	LTW_ENG_20081114.0034.LDC2009T13	"I treat each accessory as a piece of art
15638	LTW_ENG_20081114.0034.LDC2009T13	in a small space, you want everything to be important."
15639	LTW_ENG_20081114.0034.LDC2009T13	For the engaging Russell, merchandising his gift store -- a melange of home furnishings, high-end fashion, consignment clothing, jewelry, teas, chocolates and fresh seasonal flowers -- is like putting together a big puzzle.
15640	LTW_ENG_20081114.0034.LDC2009T13	"Every day I get deliveries of new merchandise," he says.
15641	LTW_ENG_20081114.0034.LDC2009T13	"I have to make it all fit in a small space and make it look attractive."
15642	LTW_ENG_20081114.0034.LDC2009T13	Which is precisely the challenge so many people face in their homes, particularly as they prepare for the onslaught of holiday parties and houseguests.
15643	LTW_ENG_20081114.0034.LDC2009T13	Russell uses his 1,100-square-foot apartment overlooking the rooftops of north Laguna Beach as an extension of the store.
15644	LTW_ENG_20081114.0034.LDC2009T13	It's as minimalist and restrained as a Beverly Hills boutique.
15645	LTW_ENG_20081114.0034.LDC2009T13	Lilac- gray and violet-slate walls create a perfect foil for his collection of well-edited furnishings, upholstered in a subtle palette of soothing alabaster, beige, gray and chocolate.
15646	LTW_ENG_20081114.0034.LDC2009T13	Like his store, a stylish mix of affordable goods -- Pottery Barn shelves, West Elm bookcases and Crate &amp
15647	LTW_ENG_20081114.0034.LDC2009T13	Barrel chairs -- keep company with Christian Liaigre consoles, stingray tables from France and $3,000 Caleb Siemon art vases.
15648	LTW_ENG_20081114.0034.LDC2009T13	"Style is not about money, but about the mix.
15649	LTW_ENG_20081114.0034.LDC2009T13	I want customers to be able to see the things I sell in my store in a home-like setting.
15650	LTW_ENG_20081114.0034.LDC2009T13	There's no reason a one-bedroom apartment can't be just as stylish as a 5,000-square-foot home," says Russell, who can be seen most days dressed in smart yet casual attire -- white Gap jeans, a Polo tee and a jaunty, custom-made linen hat.
15651	LTW_ENG_20081114.0034.LDC2009T13	Russell keeps his clothes in a well-disciplined bedroom closet.
15652	LTW_ENG_20081114.0034.LDC2009T13	The only furnishings in the room are his California king-size bed and a wall-mounted TV.
15653	LTW_ENG_20081114.0034.LDC2009T13	When he added the bed, the wood closet doors could no longer open, so in typical fashion, the inventive retailer made changes.
15654	LTW_ENG_20081114.0034.LDC2009T13	New slate-gray, Belgian linen drapes, attached by rings to a metal track, pull back to reveal sports jackets arranged in a trio of subtle, earthy hues.
15655	LTW_ENG_20081114.0034.LDC2009T13	Like items, such as V-neck sweaters, cashmere crews, short-sleeved Polos, long-sleeved Polos and button-down shirts, are precisely folded and stacked in neat piles -- not so surprising, since Russell once worked as a fashion sales associate.
15656	LTW_ENG_20081114.0034.LDC2009T13	"I'm an expert in the art of folding," he quips.
15657	LTW_ENG_20081114.0034.LDC2009T13	"Seriously, most people have way too much stuff in their closets -- and their homes.
15658	LTW_ENG_20081114.0034.LDC2009T13	There's no reason to keep a raincoat hanging 365 days of the year when you live in Southern California -- really.
15659	LTW_ENG_20081114.0034.LDC2009T13	Just leave out things you really wear and love, and stash the rest away."
15660	LTW_ENG_20081114.0034.LDC2009T13	Good advice, especially for those residing in space-challenged apartments.
15661	LTW_ENG_20081114.0034.LDC2009T13	Just 10 years ago, Russell was living in Florida and working in the hospitality business when he decided to make the move from restaurant to retail and head west.
15662	LTW_ENG_20081114.0034.LDC2009T13	"I was more interested in watching CNN's `Style with Elsa Klinch' and reading Metropolitan Home magazine than in food and wine," he says.
15663	LTW_ENG_20081114.0034.LDC2009T13	For the next five years, the garrulous Russell worked as a personal shopper for Prada, followed by a stint at A'Maree's, a high-fashion boutique in nearby Newport Beach.
15664	LTW_ENG_20081114.0034.LDC2009T13	He spent his spare time as a power seller on eBay, marketing high-end fashion and holding trunk shows at home to recycle "hardly worn haute couture."
15665	LTW_ENG_20081114.0034.LDC2009T13	Two years ago, he opened his version of a shop -- a gift boutique, he calls it -- in a former 1950s Volkswagen dealership.
15666	LTW_ENG_20081114.0034.LDC2009T13	Russell runs it like a friendly neighborhood restaurant.
15667	LTW_ENG_20081114.0034.LDC2009T13	Customers are welcomed with offers of Pellegrino, cappuccino or a cup of Marco Polo Mariages Freres tea.
15668	LTW_ENG_20081114.0034.LDC2009T13	Then there are the snacks served family-style -- Java chips with spicy hummus, a bowl of chocolate almonds or ice pops for kids.
15669	LTW_ENG_20081114.0034.LDC2009T13	On Saturdays, regulars know that mimosas and strawberries are served in the garden behind the store -- all the better to wander into his nearby annex -- two rooms beneath his apartment building that offer consignment clothing and Missoni linens.
15670	LTW_ENG_20081114.0034.LDC2009T13	But how does it feel when everything in your home is for sale, one might wonder?
15671	LTW_ENG_20081114.0034.LDC2009T13	Although he won't part with his pair of antique tortoise shells -- "they're family heirlooms," he says -- everything else has a price.
15672	LTW_ENG_20081114.0034.LDC2009T13	"Just the other day, a woman customer came in and fell in love with my linen sofa -- gone," he says with a smile.
15673	LTW_ENG_20081114.0034.LDC2009T13	"It's OK.
15674	LTW_ENG_20081114.0034.LDC2009T13	I'll make a new one.
15675	LTW_ENG_20081114.0034.LDC2009T13	Change is always good."

15677	LTW_ENG_20081130.0049.LDC2009T13	Adm. Michael Mullen, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, went unarmed into his first meeting with the new commander in chief -- no aides, no PowerPoint presentation, no briefing books.
15678	LTW_ENG_20081130.0049.LDC2009T13	Summoned nine days ago to President-elect Barack Obama's Chicago transition office, Mullen showed up with just a pad, a pen and a desire to take the measure of his incoming boss.
15679	LTW_ENG_20081130.0049.LDC2009T13	There was little talk of exiting Iraq or beefing up the U.S. force in Afghanistan
15680	LTW_ENG_20081130.0049.LDC2009T13	the one-on-one, 45-minute conversation ranged from the personal to the philosophical.
15681	LTW_ENG_20081130.0049.LDC2009T13	Mullen came away with what he wanted: a view of the next president as a non- ideological pragmatist who was willing to both listen and lead.
15682	LTW_ENG_20081130.0049.LDC2009T13	After the meeting, the chairman "felt very good, very positive," according to Mullen spokesman Capt. John Kirby.
15683	LTW_ENG_20081130.0049.LDC2009T13	As Obama prepares to announce his national security team Monday, he faces a military that has long mistrusted Democrats and is particularly wary of a young, intellectual leader with no experience in uniform, who once called Iraq a "dumb" war.
15684	LTW_ENG_20081130.0049.LDC2009T13	Military leaders have all heard his pledge to withdraw most combat forces from Iraq within 16 months -- sooner than commanders on the ground have recommended -- and his implied criticism of the Afghanistan war effort during the Bush administration.

15695	NYT_ENG_19990520.0057.LDC2007T07	LOS ANGELES
15696	NYT_ENG_19990520.0057.LDC2007T07	Mexico's President Ernest Zedillo, in a historic-three day visit to California, has offered praise for the new relationship between his country and the state and a pledge to work with Gov. Gray Davis to create ``a North American dream.''
15697	NYT_ENG_19990520.0057.LDC2007T07	``We have far to go,'' Zedillo said in a speech Wednesday to Town Hall of Los Angeles.
15698	NYT_ENG_19990520.0057.LDC2007T07	``We now have a great friend here in California (in Davis) who has made human relations a priority and has declared Mexico the most important country for California.
15699	NYT_ENG_19990520.0057.LDC2007T07	``And California is important to Mexico.
15700	NYT_ENG_19990520.0057.LDC2007T07	What happens in California affects Mexico.''
15701	NYT_ENG_19990520.0057.LDC2007T07	Zedillo and Gov. Gray Davis came from Sacramento to Los Angeles by train and were greeted at Union Station by Mayor Richard Riordan and other dignitaries.
15702	NYT_ENG_19990520.0057.LDC2007T07	Riordan offered praise for both Davis and Zedillo in seeking a harmonious relationship.
15703	NYT_ENG_19990520.0057.LDC2007T07	``(Zedillo) recognizes, as we do, that we cannot prosper as independent communities if we do not prosper in partnership,'' Riordan said.
15704	NYT_ENG_19990520.0057.LDC2007T07	``As we celebrate our history, we also embrace the dawn of a new century and the hope for a new generation where our people can share in the bounty of opportunity, prosperity and partnership,'' Riordan said.
15705	NYT_ENG_19990520.0057.LDC2007T07	Both Davis and Riordan attempted frequent words and phrases in Spanish, with the governor often referring to ``mi amigo.''
15706	NYT_ENG_19990520.0057.LDC2007T07	Riordan said to Zedillo at one point, ``Nuestra casa es su casa.''
15707	NYT_ENG_19990520.0057.LDC2007T07	Davis, who visited Zedillo on an official trip one month after taking office, said his vision is to see California and Mexico re-create the American dream as the North American dream.
15708	NYT_ENG_19990520.0057.LDC2007T07	``People came to America for liberty, opportunity, prosperity,'' Davis said.
15709	NYT_ENG_19990520.0057.LDC2007T07	``We want to see equal access to education, health care and justice.''
15710	NYT_ENG_19990520.0057.LDC2007T07	Zedillo credited Davis for the change in attitudes between the two countries since his election and the retirement of Republican Gov. Pete Wilson.
15711	NYT_ENG_19990520.0057.LDC2007T07	It was Proposition 187 banning many benefits to illegal immigrants and Wilson's support for it that led to a chill in relations.
15712	NYT_ENG_19990520.0057.LDC2007T07	The voter-approved ballot measure has been blocked by the courts from taking effect and Davis is seeking mediation on the matter, which has angered many Latino officials.
15713	NYT_ENG_19990520.0057.LDC2007T07	Zedillo, however, backed the governor and said relations between California and Mexico have never been better.
15714	NYT_ENG_19990520.0057.LDC2007T07	``Mexico is now your No.1 trading partner,'' Zedillo said.
15715	NYT_ENG_19990520.0057.LDC2007T07	``Just think how much better it could be.''
15716	NYT_ENG_19990520.0057.LDC2007T07	On Tuesday, Davis and Zedillo agreed to create a computer hookup between universities in California and Mexico.
15717	NYT_ENG_19990520.0057.LDC2007T07	On Wednesday, they announced California would create 15 trade centers to work with companies to increase trade with Mexico.
15718	NYT_ENG_19990520.0057.LDC2007T07	They also announced plans by Mexico's Federal Electricity Commission and America's Sempra Energy International to construct a 23-mile gas pipeline, from the border to Rosarito to provide energy.
15719	NYT_ENG_19990520.0057.LDC2007T07	Davis said the project will include 500 jobs in California.
15720	NYT_ENG_19990520.0057.LDC2007T07	Also, the U.S. Department of Transportation has approved a $160,000 grant to study infrastructure needs along the border.
15721	NYT_ENG_19990520.0057.LDC2007T07	Zedillo also called for California authorities to work to protect the human rights of all people, saying there had been some problems with the treatment of immigrants.
15722	NYT_ENG_19990520.0057.LDC2007T07	But most of the day was spent in saluting one another.
15723	NYT_ENG_19990520.0057.LDC2007T07	Zedillo took note of the number of Mexican descendants living in Los Angeles _ more than anywhere else in the world outside of Mexico.
15724	NYT_ENG_19990520.0057.LDC2007T07	``They work hard and proud as (U.S.) citizens, but they do not forget their heritage,'' Zedillo said.
15725	NYT_ENG_19990520.0057.LDC2007T07	Zedillo also talked of political reform that he is pushing on his country, where his party will allow open primaries for the first time in its 70-year history.
15726	NYT_ENG_19990520.0057.LDC2007T07	``No longer will an official be elected only because he is from one party,'' Zedillo said.
15727	NYT_ENG_19990520.0057.LDC2007T07	``We are moving toward more democracy.
15728	NYT_ENG_19990520.0057.LDC2007T07	We find that nearly all the time, the people are right.''
15729	NYT_ENG_20070102.0005.LDC2009T13	ARE COWBOYS SUPER OR A BUST
15730	NYT_ENG_20070102.0005.LDC2009T13	IRVING, Texas
15731	NYT_ENG_20070102.0005.LDC2009T13	Why can the Dallas Cowboys win the Super Bowl?
15732	NYT_ENG_20070102.0005.LDC2009T13	"That's a stumper," Cowboys cornerback Terence Newman answered.
15733	NYT_ENG_20070102.0005.LDC2009T13	Give him an A for honesty.
15734	NYT_ENG_20070102.0005.LDC2009T13	One month ago the fashionable pick to represent the NFC in the Super Bowl, the Cowboys collapsed their way into the postseason by losing three of their last four games, all at home.
15735	NYT_ENG_20070102.0005.LDC2009T13	"There is no (BEGIN BRACKET)silver(END BRACKET) lining here, there is no sun shining bright," defensive end Marcus Spears said after the Cowboys' 39-31 loss against Detroit on Sunday.
15736	NYT_ENG_20070102.0005.LDC2009T13	"It's bad.
15737	NYT_ENG_20070102.0005.LDC2009T13	It's gloomy, and you have to move on."
15738	NYT_ENG_20070102.0005.LDC2009T13	Moving on for the Cowboys began Monday.
15739	NYT_ENG_20070102.0005.LDC2009T13	They might have the momentum of a snail entering their wild-card playoff game in Seattle, but they are in.
15740	NYT_ENG_20070102.0005.LDC2009T13	And they have a shot.
15741	NYT_ENG_20070102.0005.LDC2009T13	Here are three reasons why the Cowboys can reach the Super Bowl, and three reasons why they can't.
15742	NYT_ENG_20070102.0005.LDC2009T13	WHY THEY CAN:
15743	NYT_ENG_20070102.0005.LDC2009T13	(1) Have you seen the NFC?
15744	NYT_ENG_20070102.0005.LDC2009T13	Every NFC team is heavily flawed.
15745	NYT_ENG_20070102.0005.LDC2009T13	The only team rolling right now is the third-seeded Eagles, who are on a five-game winning streak with a backup quarterback directing them.
15746	NYT_ENG_20070102.0005.LDC2009T13	The Bears have a problem at quarterback.
15747	NYT_ENG_20070102.0005.LDC2009T13	The Saints have a problem on defense.
15748	NYT_ENG_20070102.0005.LDC2009T13	The Seahawks haven't looked anything like the Super Bowl team of a year ago.
15749	NYT_ENG_20070102.0005.LDC2009T13	And the Giants are an 8-8 mess.
15750	NYT_ENG_20070102.0005.LDC2009T13	So the Cowboys and their problems fit in with an NFC seemingly without a favorite.
15751	NYT_ENG_20070102.0005.LDC2009T13	(2) The road is the new home
15752	NYT_ENG_20070102.0005.LDC2009T13	The Cowboys finished 4-4 at Texas Stadium, and found themselves relieved at the prospects of going on the road for the playoffs.
15753	NYT_ENG_20070102.0005.LDC2009T13	They were 5-3 on the road, and blew what appeared to be a road victory at Washington.
15754	NYT_ENG_20070102.0005.LDC2009T13	Barring the sixth-seeded Giants reaching the NFC title game, the Cowboys will play all of their playoff games away from Texas.
15755	NYT_ENG_20070102.0005.LDC2009T13	"You have to find some sort of momentum and that's probably it," tight end Jason Witten said.
15756	NYT_ENG_20070102.0005.LDC2009T13	"We play better on the road."
15757	NYT_ENG_20070102.0005.LDC2009T13	(3) Scoring isn't a problem
15758	NYT_ENG_20070102.0005.LDC2009T13	The Cowboys finished with the fifth-best offense in the NFL, and their 425 points ranked fourth.
15759	NYT_ENG_20070102.0005.LDC2009T13	Terrell Owens and Terry Glenn each had more than 1,000 receiving yards.
15760	NYT_ENG_20070102.0005.LDC2009T13	The running back tandem of Julius Jones and Marion Barber, above, combined to rush for 1,738 yards and 18 touchdowns.
15761	NYT_ENG_20070102.0005.LDC2009T13	WHY THEY CAN'T:
15762	NYT_ENG_20070102.0005.LDC2009T13	(1) Stopping teams is a major problem
15763	NYT_ENG_20070102.0005.LDC2009T13	Entering their game against the Giants on Dec. 3, the Cowboys' defense ranked fourth in the NFL.
15764	NYT_ENG_20070102.0005.LDC2009T13	It finished the season 13th.
15765	NYT_ENG_20070102.0005.LDC2009T13	The past month the Cowboys' defense gave up an average of 30 points a game, and 16 touchdown passes against four interceptions.
15766	NYT_ENG_20070102.0005.LDC2009T13	Other than a handful of stops against the Falcons on Dec. 16, the Cowboys couldn't slow any offense when it mattered.

15769	NYT_ENG_20070102.0005.LDC2009T13	Bill Parcells might have different expectations for Romo, above, because he's in his fourth NFL season, but Romo officially has returned from his trip to Fantasy Land.
15770	NYT_ENG_20070102.0005.LDC2009T13	What looked so easy in November was that difficult in December.
15771	NYT_ENG_20070102.0005.LDC2009T13	He finished the final five games with a 77.1 passer rating, with six touchdown passes and eight interceptions, and he was sacked 13 times.
15772	NYT_ENG_20070102.0005.LDC2009T13	"Maybe it's because I'm too young to let go of a game or let losses go a little bit," Romo said.
15773	NYT_ENG_20070102.0005.LDC2009T13	"It's very frustrating and disappointing for me.
15774	NYT_ENG_20070102.0005.LDC2009T13	It's one of those weeks where I'm going to have to let it go when I get out of here."

15776	NYT_ENG_20070102.0005.LDC2009T13	(3) Maybe they were a victim of hype and weren't that good.
15777	NYT_ENG_20070102.0005.LDC2009T13	In the end, the Cowboys finished with the same record as last season, 9-7.
15778	NYT_ENG_20070102.0005.LDC2009T13	And that was with the addition of Terrell Owens, left, a young defense loaded with high draft picks and high- dollar free agents, and the return of left tackle Flozell Adams.
15779	NYT_ENG_20070102.0005.LDC2009T13	But these Cowboys who once looked so good ended up defeating only one team with a winning record, the Colts.

15785	NYT_ENG_20070108.0185.LDC2009T13	PRICE FOR POOR ACADEMICS MAY GROW
15786	NYT_ENG_20070108.0185.LDC2009T13	Cox News Service
15787	NYT_ENG_20070108.0185.LDC2009T13	ORLANDO, Fla. - College teams that underperform academically might soon be hit with harsher penalties.
15788	NYT_ENG_20070108.0185.LDC2009T13	Starting with the 2008 football season and the 2008-09 basketball season, teams with a history of academically ineligible players and players who drop out or transfer face the possibility of losing one day of practice a week.
15789	NYT_ENG_20070108.0185.LDC2009T13	That's one of the penalties recommended by the NCAA's Committee on Academic Performance.
15790	NYT_ENG_20070108.0185.LDC2009T13	Those teams would also face a "significant scholarship sanction," the committee said in briefing materials distributed at the NCAA Convention.
15791	NYT_ENG_20070108.0185.LDC2009T13	Teams that don't solve their academic problems would face bans on postseason play in the 2009-10 academic year.
15792	NYT_ENG_20070108.0185.LDC2009T13	Underperforming teams already have faced some scholarship cuts, but those cuts have been small and limited to a tiny percentage of teams.
15793	NYT_ENG_20070108.0185.LDC2009T13	The NCAA planned to save its harshest sanctions for teams that showed a pattern of academic problems year after year.
15794	NYT_ENG_20070108.0185.LDC2009T13	Teams can request waivers so that players who leave school early for the pros or for medical reasons don't count as dropouts.
15795	NYT_ENG_20070108.0185.LDC2009T13	Practicing against men scrutinized
15796	NYT_ENG_20070108.0185.LDC2009T13	An overwhelming majority of women's basketball coaches believe in having their teams practice against men, the CEO of the Women's Basketball Coaches Association said Monday.
15797	NYT_ENG_20070108.0185.LDC2009T13	Beth Bass' 5,000-member organization is so close to unanimous on the issue, she told the story of one coach who couldn't believe even a tiny percentage disagreed.
15798	NYT_ENG_20070108.0185.LDC2009T13	"You tell me who that percentage is," the coach said, "because I want to play them and I'm going to beat 'em."
15799	NYT_ENG_20070108.0185.LDC2009T13	That's the coaches' view, that male practice players give their teams the opportunity to get better.
15800	NYT_ENG_20070108.0185.LDC2009T13	But the NCAA's Committee on Women's Athletics has another view, that male practice players rob women of opportunities to practice.
15801	NYT_ENG_20070108.0185.LDC2009T13	"The message for female student-athletes seems to be, 'You are not good enough to make our starters better so we'll use men instead,"' committee member Jennifer Warmack-Chipman said.
15802	NYT_ENG_20070108.0185.LDC2009T13	Her committee wants to ban male practice players for women's teams
15803	NYT_ENG_20070108.0185.LDC2009T13	that's a long way from happening.
15804	NYT_ENG_20070108.0185.LDC2009T13	Division III schools - which don't provide athletics scholarships - decided on Monday not to enact a rule that would have limited the use of male practice players to once a week.
15805	NYT_ENG_20070108.0185.LDC2009T13	The vote was 359-62 to refer the issue for further study.
15806	NYT_ENG_20070108.0185.LDC2009T13	Divisions I and II haven't addressed the topic, but NCAA vice president David Berst said Division I is likely to consider some kind of legislation in 2008.

15809	NYT_ENG_20070119.0271.LDC2009T13	CAMERON PLAYED FOR CORSO, WYCHE, KNIGHT
15810	NYT_ENG_20070119.0271.LDC2009T13	Cox News Service
15811	NYT_ENG_20070119.0271.LDC2009T13	WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. -- No NFL head coach in history besides Miami's freshly-appointed Cam Cameron can say he played in the same college career for this who's who of Hoosier coaches: Lee Corso, Sam Wyche and Bob Knight.
15812	NYT_ENG_20070119.0271.LDC2009T13	Cameron's experience as a two-sport athlete at Indiana in the early 1980s exposed him to an unusual array of coaching styles - both at a legendary basketball program and an underdog football team that had to be innovative to move the ball.
15813	NYT_ENG_20070119.0271.LDC2009T13	Corso said he still sees flashes of things Cameron learned at Indiana, often by necessity.
15814	NYT_ENG_20070119.0271.LDC2009T13	"We had to do some things different because we were always undermanned,"
15815	NYT_ENG_20070119.0271.LDC2009T13	Corso said by telephone Friday.
15816	NYT_ENG_20070119.0271.LDC2009T13	"We did things like motions and shifts because we couldn't outmuscle anybody.
15817	NYT_ENG_20070119.0271.LDC2009T13	Cam was a really good athlete.
15818	NYT_ENG_20070119.0271.LDC2009T13	He could run, he could throw it.
15819	NYT_ENG_20070119.0271.LDC2009T13	He was probably the smartest quarterback I ever had."
15820	NYT_ENG_20070119.0271.LDC2009T13	As offensive coordinator for the San Diego Chargers, Cameron produced the highest-scoring team in the league this season.
15821	NYT_ENG_20070119.0271.LDC2009T13	The Chargers effectively mixed the rushing of superstar LaDainian Tomlinson with passing routes as crisply executed as an inbounds play from Knight's heyday.
15822	NYT_ENG_20070119.0271.LDC2009T13	"I'm thrilled for him to have this opportunity," Knight said in a statement after practice Friday evening at Texas Tech.
15823	NYT_ENG_20070119.0271.LDC2009T13	"Cam Cameron is a very bright guy."
15824	NYT_ENG_20070119.0271.LDC2009T13	Cameron inherits a strong defense at Miami, but the main reason he was hired is to overhaul an unreliable offense.
15825	NYT_ENG_20070119.0271.LDC2009T13	Failure to move the ball efficiently has been the principal weakness keeping the Dolphins out of the playoffs for five straight seasons.
15826	NYT_ENG_20070119.0271.LDC2009T13	Corso, now famous for wearing mascot heads as an EPSN analyst, signed Cameron to Indiana as a quarterback from Terre Haute South High School, 60 miles cross-state from IU.
15827	NYT_ENG_20070119.0271.LDC2009T13	Corso never imagined he was recruiting for Knight as well, but Cameron had been a guard on a high school team that reached the state finals two years in a row.
15828	NYT_ENG_20070119.0271.LDC2009T13	"What happened was, the basketball team had some injuries, and Cam came to me about it," Corso recalled.
15829	NYT_ENG_20070119.0271.LDC2009T13	"I said, 'If you can go with the best coach in basketball, go."'
15830	NYT_ENG_20070119.0271.LDC2009T13	Knight virtually never allowed his athletes to play in two major sports, but made an exception for Cameron.
15831	NYT_ENG_20070119.0271.LDC2009T13	"When Cam was a college athlete, he played two years as a great contributor to our basketball team," Knight said.
15832	NYT_ENG_20070119.0271.LDC2009T13	"He accepted his role, always worked hard, and was tremendously valuable to our team concept."
15833	NYT_ENG_20070119.0271.LDC2009T13	Cameron went on to become an assistant under Michigan coaching legend Bo Schembechler, who died two months ago.
15834	NYT_ENG_20070119.0271.LDC2009T13	"Although Bo isn't here to tell you himself, I know he really liked Cam," Knight said.
15835	NYT_ENG_20070119.0271.LDC2009T13	"Both of us are really proud of Cam."
15836	NYT_ENG_20070119.0271.LDC2009T13	Corso knew Cameron wanted to become a coach, even when Cameron still was playing in college.
15837	NYT_ENG_20070119.0271.LDC2009T13	That soon became apparent to Wyche, Corso's coaching successor in Cameron's senior year in 1983.
15838	NYT_ENG_20070119.0271.LDC2009T13	"He was an athlete who studied the game
15839	NYT_ENG_20070119.0271.LDC2009T13	he didn't just play it," said Wyche, a longtime football analyst who now does radio work for Westwood One.
15840	NYT_ENG_20070119.0271.LDC2009T13	"He would have ideas during the game to suggest a different
15841	NYT_ENG_20070119.0271.LDC2009T13	blocking scheme."
15842	NYT_ENG_20070119.0271.LDC2009T13	Wyche left after one year at Indiana to take over the Cincinnati Bengals -- whom he eventually led to a Super Bowl - but has kept up with his former player over the years while in broadcasting.
15843	NYT_ENG_20070119.0271.LDC2009T13	"He obviously had the players in San Diego, but his first challenge now is evaluating what he has on offense," Wyche said.
15844	NYT_ENG_20070119.0271.LDC2009T13	"If he feels like Daunte Culpepper is not going to be a sure thing, I am sure he will look at bringing in somebody else."
15845	NYT_ENG_20070119.0271.LDC2009T13	Bringing in Cameron is the right move, Corso said.
15846	NYT_ENG_20070119.0271.LDC2009T13	"He's going to build an offense there, but the key is patience," Corso said.
15847	NYT_ENG_20070119.0271.LDC2009T13	"It's not going to happen in a month or maybe a year.
15848	NYT_ENG_20070119.0271.LDC2009T13	But he's going to do it."

15851	NYT_ENG_20070123.0229.LDC2009T13	NYMEX ABANDONING PLANS FOR BRITISH TRADING FLOOR
15852	NYT_ENG_20070123.0229.LDC2009T13	LONDON
15853	NYT_ENG_20070123.0229.LDC2009T13	Nymex Holdings, parent company of the New York Mercantile Exchange and a lonely champion of open-outcry trading, is cutting its last ties to an ill-fated plan to set up a trading floor in Britain.
15854	NYT_ENG_20070123.0229.LDC2009T13	The commodities market has quietly applied for "derecognition of exchange" with British regulators, traders here in London said.
15855	NYT_ENG_20070123.0229.LDC2009T13	Markets that trade in London are required to certify to the main regulator, the Financial Services Authority of Britain, that they are "recognized investment exchanges."
15856	NYT_ENG_20070123.0229.LDC2009T13	With the request for "derecognition," Nymex's presence in London reverts to a marketing office, a far cry from the ambitious expansion plans it undertook less than two years ago.
15857	NYT_ENG_20070123.0229.LDC2009T13	"We've had to adjust our business model," a Nymex spokeswoman, Anu Ahluwalia, said Tuesday, confirming the application.
15858	NYT_ENG_20070123.0229.LDC2009T13	"We were very ambitious and went in and built a trading floor, and that is not the way that business is going, so we adapted very quickly."
15859	NYT_ENG_20070123.0229.LDC2009T13	Since Nymex went public last November, investors and analysts have wondered how the company might expand internationally and take advantage of the worldwide boom in commodities.
15860	NYT_ENG_20070123.0229.LDC2009T13	Nymex's British foray could provide a good road map of the wrong way to do so.
15861	NYT_ENG_20070123.0229.LDC2009T13	The movement across the Atlantic started after the International Petroleum Exchange in London went fully electronic in April 2005, following 25 years of open-outcry trading.
15862	NYT_ENG_20070123.0229.LDC2009T13	That market is part of the IntercontinentalExchange, or ICE, Nymex's big rival.
15863	NYT_ENG_20070123.0229.LDC2009T13	The New York exchange had already tested an open-outcry exchange in Dublin, which it opened in 2004.
15864	NYT_ENG_20070123.0229.LDC2009T13	But Nymex was not able to move quickly, and it took five months to get the trading floor up and running, a result in part of regulatory snarls.
15865	NYT_ENG_20070123.0229.LDC2009T13	Nymex spent millions trying to encourage traders to use its London floor, and on the first day of trading, in September 2005, 12 companies and 76 traders showed up.
15866	NYT_ENG_20070123.0229.LDC2009T13	Nymex was expected to start open-pit exchanges in Dubai, Singapore and possibly Tokyo or Shanghai.
15867	NYT_ENG_20070123.0229.LDC2009T13	But the British initiative proved short-lived, and appears to have discouraged plans for open pits elsewhere.
15868	NYT_ENG_20070123.0229.LDC2009T13	By March 2006, Nymex in London was trading fewer than 20 contracts a day for Brent crude futures, the most common oil contract here, compared with about 200,000 on ICE Futures.
15869	NYT_ENG_20070123.0229.LDC2009T13	Executives at other exchanges and commodity traders said that Nymex's five-month delay in opening gave the International Petroleum Exchange time to learn how to trade electronically, or time to drift into another business.
15870	NYT_ENG_20070123.0229.LDC2009T13	The IPE's electronic exchange was also faster than some critics expected.
15871	NYT_ENG_20070123.0229.LDC2009T13	Nymex's foray also inspired ICE to start trading an important Nymex product, West Texas intermediate crude oil.
15872	NYT_ENG_20070123.0229.LDC2009T13	By June 2006, Nymex had closed its London open-outcry floor and transferred trading of European commodity contracts onto an electronic and an over-the-counter exchange.
15873	NYT_ENG_20070123.0229.LDC2009T13	Open outcry in London "never took off the way that we hoped," Ahluwalia said.
15874	NYT_ENG_20070123.0229.LDC2009T13	"This is by no means an end to our global growth."
15875	NYT_ENG_20070123.0229.LDC2009T13	Nymex Holdings also includes the Comex metals market in New York.
15876	NYT_ENG_20070123.0229.LDC2009T13	It has offices in Singapore and Tokyo, and is working with the Dubai government to open a mercantile exchange there, which will be electronic.
15877	NYT_ENG_20070123.0229.LDC2009T13	"We're going to expand our brand globally," Ahluwalia said, "just not through a trading floor."
15878	NYT_ENG_20070123.0229.LDC2009T13	Though Nymex failed in London, some open-outcry exchanges still exist here.
15879	NYT_ENG_20070123.0229.LDC2009T13	The London Metal Exchange does the bulk of its trading by open outcry, and had record volume in 2006.
15880	NYT_ENG_20070123.0229.LDC2009T13	Open outcry "is still the most efficient and most popular method of trading," a spokesman for the London Metal Exchange, Adam Robinson, said.

15883	NYT_ENG_20070126.0042.LDC2009T13	Hollywood and national politics scrambled for our attention this week.
15884	NYT_ENG_20070126.0042.LDC2009T13	They drew special interest from some in this city, graced as it now is with almost as many potential presidential candidates as Naomi Campbell has tantrums.
15885	NYT_ENG_20070126.0042.LDC2009T13	Normally, New York is ignored in presidential elections (except when candidates need cash), but it is in the thick of things this time.
15886	NYT_ENG_20070126.0042.LDC2009T13	Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton has entered the race.
15887	NYT_ENG_20070126.0042.LDC2009T13	Former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani seems ready to follow.
15888	NYT_ENG_20070126.0042.LDC2009T13	Former Gov. George E. Pataki entertains the fanciful notion that he could be the chosen one.
15889	NYT_ENG_20070126.0042.LDC2009T13	Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg hears advice that he and his billions should go for it.
15890	NYT_ENG_20070126.0042.LDC2009T13	And the ever-running Rev. Al Sharpton used the royal "we" to hint that he still has game.
15891	NYT_ENG_20070126.0042.LDC2009T13	"We clearly have a reason to run," he said two weeks ago.
15892	NYT_ENG_20070126.0042.LDC2009T13	While presidential politics swirled in the winter air, the Academy Awards people reminded everyone what is truly important by announcing this year's nominations.
15893	NYT_ENG_20070126.0042.LDC2009T13	People had movies on the brain, Clinton among them.
15894	NYT_ENG_20070126.0042.LDC2009T13	Letting the conversation begin on her Web site, she took a question about her screen favorites.
15895	NYT_ENG_20070126.0042.LDC2009T13	She had three, she said, from different stages of her life: "The Wizard of Oz," "Casablanca" and "Out of Africa."
15896	NYT_ENG_20070126.0042.LDC2009T13	Let's see.
15897	NYT_ENG_20070126.0042.LDC2009T13	"The Wizard of Oz" is about a girl trying to get back home -- to a white house, wasn't it?
15898	NYT_ENG_20070126.0042.LDC2009T13	The hero in "Casablanca" warns, "Either lay off politics or get out."
15899	NYT_ENG_20070126.0042.LDC2009T13	And, at the risk of squeezing a long-wrung-out subject, "Out of Africa" is about a woman with a husband described in a 1985 review as "an ebullient, unashamed philanderer."
15900	NYT_ENG_20070126.0042.LDC2009T13	We're guessing that Clinton chose those splendid films for different reasons.
15901	NYT_ENG_20070126.0042.LDC2009T13	Presumably, the other politicians have their own favorites.

15923	NYT_ENG_20070126.0179.LDC2009T13	U.N. OFFICIAL ADVANCES PLAN THAT COULD MAKE KOSOVO INDEPENDENT
15924	NYT_ENG_20070126.0179.LDC2009T13	PARIS
15925	NYT_ENG_20070126.0179.LDC2009T13	The U.N. mediator Martti Ahtisaari presented his proposals for the final status of Kosovo on Friday, likely setting the tiny war-torn territory on its way toward independence.
15926	NYT_ENG_20070126.0179.LDC2009T13	Although that goal is still months away and subject to a vote at the United Nations, the presentation of a plan is an important and long-delayed step in resolving the still potentially explosive tensions that led to war in Europe just eight years ago.
15927	NYT_ENG_20070126.0179.LDC2009T13	The recommendations would leave the former Yugoslav province free to declare independence from Serbia, according to Western diplomats who discussed the plan that will be made public next week.
15928	NYT_ENG_20070126.0179.LDC2009T13	But they say the plan would also impose international supervision, much like what exists in Bosnia, in what appears to be an attempt to provide protection for Kosovo's ethnic Serb minority.
15929	NYT_ENG_20070126.0179.LDC2009T13	As a result, the proposals fall short of the full independence so hoped for by the territory's majority population of ethnic Albanians, according to Western diplomats.
15930	NYT_ENG_20070126.0179.LDC2009T13	Even with the promise of international involvement, the diplomats say, Russia, a Serbian ally whose support is key, remains cool to the plan.
15931	NYT_ENG_20070126.0179.LDC2009T13	The proposals foresee a strong international presence for the indefinite future, and include "a lot of measures to guarantee and promote the rights of the minority communities," Remi Dourlot, Ahtisaari's spokesman, said in Vienna, where the plan was presented.
15932	NYT_ENG_20070126.0179.LDC2009T13	NATO troops, which have kept peace in Kosovo since fighting ended in 1999, would remain for the time being.
15933	NYT_ENG_20070126.0179.LDC2009T13	The U.N. mission governing the territory would be replaced by another international organization that would have executive powers to any annul legislation that breaches Kosovo's obligations under U.N. agreements, diplomats said.
15934	NYT_ENG_20070126.0179.LDC2009T13	If the U.N. Security Council approves the plan, Kosovo is expected to quickly declare its independence and could expect swift recognition from its U.S. and European supporters, even if Serbia rejected such a move.
15935	NYT_ENG_20070126.0179.LDC2009T13	But that step, diplomats caution, is probably months away.
15936	NYT_ENG_20070126.0179.LDC2009T13	"I foresee this process taking some time, and we might be in a wholly different situation," said one senior Western diplomat in Vienna who asked not to be identified because he was not authorized to comment on the proposal until it is made public.
15937	NYT_ENG_20070126.0179.LDC2009T13	"No one can predict the Security Council dynamic."
15938	NYT_ENG_20070126.0179.LDC2009T13	Ahtisaari handed his recommendations to representatives of the so-called Contact Group -- the United States, Britain, France, Germany, Italy and Russia -- during a meeting at a secret location in the Austrian capital.
15939	NYT_ENG_20070126.0179.LDC2009T13	It will be presented to the Serbian government in Belgrade and the Kosovo government in Pristina on Feb. 2.
15940	NYT_ENG_20070126.0179.LDC2009T13	Even then, only the broad outlines of the proposal are expected to be made public.
15941	NYT_ENG_20070126.0179.LDC2009T13	Serbia and Kosovo will have the opportunity to ask questions and suggest changes to the proposals.
15942	NYT_ENG_20070126.0179.LDC2009T13	When Ahtisaari feels he has exhausted those negotiations, he will present a plan to the Security Council for approval.
15943	NYT_ENG_20070126.0179.LDC2009T13	Kosovo and Belgrade remain far apart in their positions, and experts say it is unlikely Ahtisaari can close the gap.
15944	NYT_ENG_20070126.0179.LDC2009T13	Already, Russia, which supports Serbia's efforts to keep Kosovo as a province, is pushing for the Security Council vote to be delayed until Belgrade has formed a government after recent elections, diplomats in Vienna say.
15945	NYT_ENG_20070126.0179.LDC2009T13	Serbia's nationalist Radical Party came in first with 28 percent of the vote earlier this month, but the democratic parties that came in second and third have the best chance to form a coalition.
15946	NYT_ENG_20070126.0179.LDC2009T13	It took Serbian parties three months to form a government after the previous elections.

15948	NYT_ENG_20070126.0179.LDC2009T13	But four Western diplomats interviewed said they doubted that Serbia could prevail upon Russia to veto a resolution once the Security Council is presented with one.
15949	NYT_ENG_20070126.0179.LDC2009T13	Ahtisaari, a former Finnish president, has not said when he expects to send the proposals to the Security Council, but diplomats involved in the negotiations say they are pressing for it to happen this spring.

15951	NYT_ENG_20070126.0179.LDC2009T13	Within hours of the Vienna meeting, details of the document were leaking out.
15952	NYT_ENG_20070126.0179.LDC2009T13	According to one diplomat familiar with the proposal, it would give Kosovo the right to enter into some international agreements and join world organizations as a sovereign state.
15953	NYT_ENG_20070126.0179.LDC2009T13	NATO would train a civil defense force that could eventually become a Kosovo army, though it is not clear what would become of the controversial Kosovo Protection Corps, which includes former Kosovo Liberation Army fighters and has been accused of aiding ethnic Albanian rebels in Macedonia and other misconduct.
15954	NYT_ENG_20070126.0179.LDC2009T13	In other ways, Kosovo would remain subject to international community oversight.
15955	NYT_ENG_20070126.0179.LDC2009T13	The European Union is already setting up a police force of more than 1,000 officers to monitor the territory's police, judges, prosecutors and even prison guards.
15956	NYT_ENG_20070126.0179.LDC2009T13	The most sensitive part of the plan concerns treatment of the estimated 114,000 Serbs in Kosovo, most of whom adamantly oppose independence from Serbia.
15957	NYT_ENG_20070126.0179.LDC2009T13	To reassure the minority that their rights will not be overrun, some Serbian areas would reportedly be given autonomy, and be free to receive some Serbian government help in building hospitals and schools.
15958	NYT_ENG_20070126.0179.LDC2009T13	Ahtisaari's plan also reportedly provides for the creation of several new municipalities where the concentration of Serbs is high.
15959	NYT_ENG_20070126.0179.LDC2009T13	Serbian legislators in the Kosovo parliament, meanwhile, would be able to stop at least some legislation if they believe it discriminates against the Serb minority.

15964	NYT_ENG_20070126.0179.LDC2009T13	Kosovo, the size of Connecticut, has roughly 2 million people, 90 percent of whom are ethnic Albanian Muslims, a legacy of Ottoman rule.

15966	NYT_ENG_20070126.0179.LDC2009T13	It was an autonomous region within the Yugoslav federation until 1989, when Slobodan Milosevic asserted Belgrade's authority over the territory.
15967	NYT_ENG_20070126.0179.LDC2009T13	That led to a rebellion by ethnic Albanians that was brutally suppressed until NATO intervened with a bombing campaign against Milosevic's troops in March 1999.

15973	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	Sheik Reda Shata pushed into Costco behind an empty cart.
15974	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	He wore a black leather jacket over his long, rustling robe, a pocket Quran tucked inside.
15975	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	The imam, a 38-year-old Egyptian, seemed not to notice the stares from other shoppers.
15976	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	He was hunting for a bargain, and soon found it in the beverage aisle, where a 32-can pack of Coca-Cola sold for $8.29.
15977	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	For Shata, this was a satisfying Islamic experience.
15978	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	"The Prophet said, 'Whoever is frugal will never suffer financially,"' said the imam, who shops weekly at the local store and admits to praying for its owners.
15979	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	He smiled.
15980	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	"These are the people who will go to heaven."
15981	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	Seven months have passed since Shata moved to this suburban town in New Jersey to lead a mosque of prosperous, settled immigrants.
15982	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	It is a world away from Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, where he toiled for almost four years, serving hundreds of struggling Muslims for whom America was still new.
15983	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	His transition is a familiar one for foreign-born imams in the United States, who often start out in city mosques before moving to more serene settings.
15984	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	For Shata, Middletown promised comfort after years of hardship.
15985	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	He left behind a tiny apartment for a house with green shutters set amid maple trees and sweeping lawns.
15986	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	He got a raise.
15987	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	He learned to drive.
15988	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	But the suburbs have brought challenges that Shata never imagined.
15989	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	His congregation in Brooklyn may have been on the margins of American society, but it was deeply rooted in Islam.
15990	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	Muslims in Middletown are generally more assimilated but less connected to their mosque.
15991	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	To be a successful suburban imam, he found, meant persuading doctors and lawyers not to rush from prayers to beat traffic.
15992	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	It meant connecting with teenagers who drove new cars, and who peppered their Arabic with "like" and "yeah."
15993	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	It meant helping his daughter cope with mockery at school, in a town that lost dozens of people Sept. 11 2001.
15994	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	Shata knew from his years in Brooklyn that the job demanded more than preaching and leading prayers, the things for which he was trained in Egypt.
15995	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	In America, he helped to arrange marriages.
15996	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	He mediated between the FBI and his people.
15997	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	He set up a makeshift Islamic court to resolve disputes among hot dog vendors.
15998	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	Last summer, as he prepared to join a new community where the median income is roughly $86,000, he reminded himself that Islam has no quarrel with wealth -- as long as the wealthy are pious.
15999	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	Still, he was stunned when a man at the mosque bought his daughter a new car, only for her to request a different model.
16000	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	"Islam says to a Muslim you can own the world if you want, but don't get attached to it," said Shata, speaking Arabic through a translator.
16001	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	"Put the world in your hands, not your heart."
16002	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	The open spaces of Monmouth County appealed to the imam after years in a crowded city.
16003	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	But with space comes distance.
16004	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	It hardly surprised Shata that prayer attendance was thin
16005	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	many congregants live more than 20 miles away.
16006	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	In a land of Little League and shopping malls, signs of Muslim identity are few.
16007	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	At first glance, Shata's new mosque could pass for an elegant office building.
16008	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	It has no minaret and a barely visible dome.
16009	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	Girls in head scarves are scarce at the local public schools.
16010	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	Some cover their heads with hooded sweatshirts.
16011	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	Compared with his congregants, the imam sometimes looks like an apparition from another century.
16012	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	In his silk hat and robe, he preaches to men in suits or blue jeans, cell phones clasped to their belts.
16013	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	But Shata believes this group is vital to Islam's future in the West.
16014	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	The religion's survival, he said, depends not only on its ability to flourish in the immigrant footholds of America, but in its most settled corners.
16015	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	"We are in this country, and we must learn to live with its people," Shata said.

16017	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	One sunny afternoon in September, the mosque's parking lot was empty but for a red 1997 Dodge Neon.

16022	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	Then he stomped his sandaled foot on the gas, and the car lurched ahead.
16023	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	Shata had never driven a car until he moved to Middletown.
16024	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	As a boy, he became frightened of driving after a tractor killed a man in his Egyptian farming village.

16027	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	Middletown is only 43 miles southwest of the city, but to Shata, it seemed farther.
16028	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	In Brooklyn, his daily walk to the mosque, Masjid Moussab, caused a commotion, with cabdrivers honking and shopkeepers waving.
16029	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	In Middletown, where Shata now lives next to the mosque, he sees deer and rabbits on his way to the dawn prayer.
16030	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	But Brooklyn had a way of following him.
16031	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	Fathers in Bay Ridge still sought the imam's help in finding suitable husbands for their daughters.

16038	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	Shata missed the city at times.
16039	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	But his relationship with Muslims in Brooklyn had changed after a series of articles about him appeared in The New York Times last March.
16040	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	At first, he found himself a minor celebrity.
16041	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	The articles were reprinted in Arabic-language newspapers, both in the United States and the Middle East.
16042	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	Hundreds of strangers reached out to him, seeking advice.
16043	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	The imam's "little black book" -- a roster of Muslims in search of spouses -- quickly lengthened, by a third, to 820 phone numbers and names.
16044	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	But the articles also stirred a controversy Shata never expected.
16045	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	Many Muslims were shocked to read that the imam thought oral sex was permissible for married couples (even though respected Islamic scholars in the Middle East concurred with his opinion, he said).
16046	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	Others objected to his view that Muslims could sell liquor or pork if they could find no other work.
16047	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	One critique of Shata on a jihadist Web site in England singled out his hometown, Kafr al Battikh, which is known for its watermelons.
16048	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	"Oh, Allah," it read, "preserve Islam and Muslims from the evil people of watermelons."
16049	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	In Bay Ridge, the articles prompted a fistfight outside a Dunkin' Donuts.
16050	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	Fliers warned in Arabic that the imam was "a devil."
16051	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	"He just wanted to please the West," said Hesham Elashry, a local Egyptian tailor.
16052	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	"No one can change Islam to make people happy."
16053	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	After weeks of defending himself, Shata felt worn down.
16054	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	Other mosques had long tried to lure him away.
16055	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	As word of his troubles spread, recruiters stepped forward.
16056	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	"He was tied to his people," said Mohammed Mosaad, who sits on the board of the mosque in Middletown.
16057	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	Like many suburban mosques, Masjid Al-Aman, which means "mosque of peace," began in the 1980s with a group of families who met privately to pray.
16058	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	Eventually, they bought a six-acre property on Red Hill Road and raised $1.7 million to build their mosque, which was completed in 2003.
16059	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	Leaders of the mosque, which has a largely Egyptian congregation, called the imam for months.
16060	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	They offered to renovate a house on the property, with a new kitchen and a custom-made library.
16061	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	Shata prayed for a sign from God.
16062	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	One morning at dawn, the imam said, he heard a voice telling him that the mosque in Middletown "is peace."
16063	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	He resigned that day.
16064	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	PLANTING NEW ROOTS
16065	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	One evening in July, shortly before Shata moved to the suburbs, he paid the mosque in Middletown a visit.
16066	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	Crickets chirped.
16067	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	The grass whispered.
16068	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	The stars blinked from above.
16069	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	The imam circled the mosque, accompanied by three friends.
16070	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	He paused to look at the trees, which seemed to sparkle.
16071	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	Shata turned to the men and asked if the forest might have jinn, the Arabic word for spirits.
16072	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	"No," one of the men replied.
16073	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	"The bugs light up here."
16074	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	It was one of many things that impressed Shata about his new environment.
16075	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	He loved to sit on his front porch and write his Friday sermons.
16076	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	The rain, he said, was "like a symphony of music."
16077	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	In Brooklyn, the imam's family rarely left their apartment.
16078	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	His 8 -year-old daughter, Rawda, is epileptic and used to suffer frequent seizures.
16079	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	Now the four children run freely on the grass.
16080	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	Rawda has not had a seizure for months, ever since doctors changed her medication.
16081	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	The imam's wife, Omyma, looked up at the sky one September afternoon.
16082	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	"Smell!
16083	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	Smell!"
16084	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	she said, inhaling deeply.
16085	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	"Pure oxygen.
16086	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	Pure."
16087	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	But if Shata's family life had improved, his new mosque needed work.
16088	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	In Bay Ridge, congregants lingered after prayers, exchanging kisses and hugs.
16089	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	In Middletown, an air of anonymity hung over the mosque.
16090	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	"We needed someone to bring us together," said one member, Omar Mostafa, 42.
16091	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	Shata began by memorizing the names of his roughly 600 congregants and tracking their attendance.
16092	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	(The same prodigious memory had enabled him to memorize the Quran by the age of 8.)
16093	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	A Jordanian-born cardiologist, Raed Jitan, missed the Friday prayer soon after he was introduced to the new imam.
16094	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	When the doctor reappeared at the mosque, he was stunned to hear Shata call out, "Raed, where have you been?"
16095	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	It became common to hear the imam interrupt himself, midsermon, with admonitions like, "Ahmed, don't fall asleep on me."
16096	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	One Friday, Shata ordered the congregants to stand up and exchange compliments.
16097	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	Another day, he told them they could not leave before shaking hands.
16098	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	By the early fall, Masjid Al-Aman was a different place.
16099	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	Attendance at daily prayers had quadrupled.
16100	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	The imam's evening lectures were packed.
16101	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	"The seeds have taken root very fast," Shata said.
16102	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	He was relieved that many of his new congregants seemed modern- minded.
16103	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	But he is still adjusting to the fact that, at dinner parties, men and women often eat together.
16104	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	(Such engagements do not violate Islamic law, Shata said, but he and his wife prefer more traditional gatherings where men and women sit in separate rooms and have their own entrances.)

16106	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	Shata uses Islamic contracts in Middletown, as he had in Brooklyn, to help settle disputes between married couples.
16107	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	But the money involved sometimes makes him gasp.
16108	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	In Brooklyn, a man had agreed to pay his wife $10 every time he insulted her.
16109	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	In Middletown, a similar contract brought $1,000 per insult.
16110	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	Wealth became a frequent theme in his sermons.
16111	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	"The true value of a person is not in his clothing, car or bank account, but in his account with Allah," he said in one sermon.
16112	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	At times, Shata could not help but think of his own financial status.
16113	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	He told himself that it did not matter that his house was modest compared with the "palaces" of some congregants, or that his used Dodge stood out among their Lexuses and BMWs.
16114	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	"I am very satisfied with what God has given me," he said one afternoon.
16115	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	He did not know then that his 12-year-old daughter, Esteshhad, wanted to ask him for a cell phone.

16118	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	On Sunday mornings, the main worship area of the mosque -- a place normally reserved for men -- becomes a teenage oasis.
16119	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	Girls in head scarves sit to one side, and boys in sweatshirts and varsity jackets to the other.
16120	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	Their cell phones beep with text messages as the imam stands before them.
16121	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	"Who has a question today?"
16122	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	he asked one recent Sunday.
16123	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	A curly-haired boy raised his hand.
16124	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	"According to the Prophet, at what age should a young man get married?"
16125	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	he asked.
16126	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	Shata launched into a careful lecture about how modern life is different from the Prophet's time, when boys married at 16.
16127	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	Islam, he said, dictates no specific age.
16128	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	"Can a man marry more than one wife?"
16129	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	another boy asked.
16130	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	"Why are the questions about marriage today?"
16131	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	the imam replied.
16132	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	"What's going on?"
16133	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	The room was silent.
16134	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	He wiped his glasses, trying to buy time.
16135	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	"If you are able to marry one," he finally said, "don't think about marrying another one."
16136	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	Another hand shot up, that of a 16-year-old girl.
16137	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	"What are the specific circumstances that allow a man to marry a second wife?"
16138	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	the girl, Sara Abdelmottlib, asked.
16139	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	Once again, the imam was cornered.
16140	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	Back in Egypt, young Muslims were reticent in the presence of sheiks.
16141	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	But in America, Shata noticed, children are taught to ask many questions.
16142	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	Shata had no doubt about the answer: According to Islamic law, a man is allowed up to four wives.
16143	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	But the imam also believed that such arrangements never worked, and that discussing them was unhelpful in the United States.
16144	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	He stared at the girls.
16145	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	"There is no woman out there who agrees to her husband marrying a second wife, even if she cannot bear children," he said.
16146	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	Then he turned to the boys.
16147	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	"A man who is not satisfied with one wife will never be satisfied with four," he said.
16148	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	Abdelmottlib looked over at the boys, her chin raised in triumph.
16149	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	Shata often feels out of place among his youngest congregants.
16150	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	They seem so different from him -- the way they dress, the way they speak, even the way they think.
16151	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	But he considers no part of his job more important.

16153	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	"The tree of faith in their hearts has to be constantly watered before it dries up," he said.
16154	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	It seemed to Shata that young Muslims in the suburbs had no guide to help them balance Islamic virtues with adolescent urges, the culture of their parents with the pressures of their peers.
16155	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	Some men at the mosque complained that their sons refused to kiss their hands in a show of respect.
16156	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	Shata sided with the boys: This tradition was cultural, he said, not Islamic.
16157	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	Other parents forbade their daughters from joining swim teams at school, arguing that Islamic law does not allow women to reveal their bodies in public.
16158	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	The imam suggested a compromise: they could swim in bodysuits, with only females present.
16159	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	Still, it was one thing for Shata to mediate these problems at the mosque, and another to face them at home.
16160	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	One afternoon this month, a yellow school bus with mechanical problems pulled into the mosque's parking lot.
16161	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	The imam had just finished the afternoon prayer and was leaving the mosque.
16162	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	Eagerly, he walked up to the bus, his long robe flapping.
16163	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	He wondered if his daughter Esteshhad might be onboard.
16164	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	As he drew closer, he saw the children pointing at him and laughing.
16165	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	He struggled, in English, to offer the driver help, but she politely declined.
16166	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	He searched for his daughter.
16167	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	It was not her bus.
16168	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	Relieved, he walked away.
16169	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	For Esteshhad, life had been hard enough, he thought.
16170	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	After attending an Islamic school in Brooklyn, she is now one of only two girls who wear head scarves at her public middle school.
16171	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	She sits alone at the front of her bus.
16172	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	In the cafeteria, she eats by herself.
16173	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	"They keep thinking I'm weird," she said.
16174	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	"I feel weird, too."
16175	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	She hears about sleepovers and trips to the mall, but she has yet to experience these things.
16176	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	Her mother cannot drive, and Shata is reluctant to chauffeur his children until he feels safer in the car.
16177	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	Outside school, Esteshhad's only other contact with her peers comes at the mosque.
16178	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	But even there -- where some girls carry designer bags -- she often feels left out.
16179	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	One night this month, she sat slouched on the edge of her bed.
16180	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	If only she had a cell phone or an iPod, she said, she might have friends.
16181	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	"I have friends," her 7-year-old sister, Rahma, piped up.
16182	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	"You don't wear a hijab," Esteshhad shot back.
16183	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	Recently, her mother noticed that Esteshhad had forgotten parts of the Quran.

16189	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	Still, it pains him to see Esteshhad so alone.
16190	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	When asked how he would respond if Esteshhad stopped wearing a head scarf, the imam thought for a moment.
16191	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	Such a scenario, for him, would have been unthinkable in Egypt.

16197	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	Teaching, for the imam, also means learning.
16198	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	He will learn as he goes, he said, with Esteshhad at school, with the teenagers at his mosque.
16199	NYT_ENG_20070127.0082.LDC2009T13	It is a path he began in Brooklyn.

16206	NYT_ENG_20070223.0174.LDC2009T13	HOLLAND, Mich.
16207	NYT_ENG_20070223.0174.LDC2009T13	Right up there with putting an aging parent in a nursing home stands the wrenching job of handing over a family business to be run by outsiders.
16208	NYT_ENG_20070223.0174.LDC2009T13	It happens to any family firm that lasts long enough, from Wal- Mart Stores on down.
16209	NYT_ENG_20070223.0174.LDC2009T13	And, as the experience of the 102-year-old Louis Padnos Iron &amp
16210	NYT_ENG_20070223.0174.LDC2009T13	amp
16211	NYT_ENG_20070223.0174.LDC2009T13	Metal Co. shows, the transition can be as quirky as the founding family.
16212	NYT_ENG_20070223.0174.LDC2009T13	The Padnos' problem is an age gap.
16213	NYT_ENG_20070223.0174.LDC2009T13	Third-generation members who run the scrap-metal company, which employs about 400 people and has annual sales of about $300 million, are in their 50s.
16214	NYT_ENG_20070223.0174.LDC2009T13	They want to work less.
16215	NYT_ENG_20070223.0174.LDC2009T13	But the fourth-generation Padnoses who might someday want to run the place are still only in their teens.
16216	NYT_ENG_20070223.0174.LDC2009T13	So, the company hired a local philosophy professor, a man who also spends time tutoring convicts at a nearby state prison in classic literature and other topics, to help groom six hired managers to become, well, more Padnos-like.
16217	NYT_ENG_20070223.0174.LDC2009T13	What does that mean?
16218	NYT_ENG_20070223.0174.LDC2009T13	For starters, as the Padnoses themselves point out, they are politically liberal, Jewish and, having grown up wealthy enough to travel widely, they are worldly.
16219	NYT_ENG_20070223.0174.LDC2009T13	Mitchell W. Padnos, one of four third-generation owners who run the company, worked after college at a Barcelona, Spain, steel mill.
16220	NYT_ENG_20070223.0174.LDC2009T13	His cousin, Jeff Padnos, now the company president, once gave a speech to a Katmandu, Nepal, science club in the middle of a six- month around-the-world vacation before starting business school, he said.
16221	NYT_ENG_20070223.0174.LDC2009T13	The managers, on the other hand, are mostly conservative, from Protestant backgrounds with working class-roots, and have spent much less time outside western Michigan.
16222	NYT_ENG_20070223.0174.LDC2009T13	"We just happen to be a Jewish family sitting in the middle of this," said Mitch Padnos, growing up and living in an area that has historically been heavily Dutch.
16223	NYT_ENG_20070223.0174.LDC2009T13	He added that the elder Padnoses expected their children to behave in ways that reflected well on their religion.
16224	NYT_ENG_20070223.0174.LDC2009T13	"My dad was very sensitive," he said.
16225	NYT_ENG_20070223.0174.LDC2009T13	As a result, the third-generation Padnoses view themselves as part entrepreneurs, part social workers.
16226	NYT_ENG_20070223.0174.LDC2009T13	And it is the latter quality they seem most eager to pass along to the managers.
16227	NYT_ENG_20070223.0174.LDC2009T13	"I'm becoming more and more missionary-like," said Jeff Padnos.
16228	NYT_ENG_20070223.0174.LDC2009T13	"Doing business right really is like applied religion."
16229	NYT_ENG_20070223.0174.LDC2009T13	He said he recently agreed to hire a man with a criminal record.
16230	NYT_ENG_20070223.0174.LDC2009T13	If it works out, he said, "you remember that better than any buy- low, sell-high deal you've made."
16231	NYT_ENG_20070223.0174.LDC2009T13	The company said it had never laid off workers.
16232	NYT_ENG_20070223.0174.LDC2009T13	A family foundation holds about $7 million and contributes to many local organizations each year.
16233	NYT_ENG_20070223.0174.LDC2009T13	The Padnos name is all over western Michigan, adorning the Amtrak station here, the engineering school at nearby Grand Valley State University and sculpture gardens in the area.
16234	NYT_ENG_20070223.0174.LDC2009T13	"They're wonderful benefactors," said the mayor of Holland, Al McGeehan.
16235	NYT_ENG_20070223.0174.LDC2009T13	Sure, the Padnoses could sell the company and probably collect considerably more than $100 million.
16236	NYT_ENG_20070223.0174.LDC2009T13	But selling, said Mitch Padnos, would make him just another idle rich guy.
16237	NYT_ENG_20070223.0174.LDC2009T13	"I have friends who have no place to go every day," he said.
16238	NYT_ENG_20070223.0174.LDC2009T13	"Once you've sold your business, you're done."
16239	NYT_ENG_20070223.0174.LDC2009T13	Many entrepreneurial dynasties build family customs around the business itself, meaning a sale can emotionally upend the family.
16240	NYT_ENG_20070223.0174.LDC2009T13	"It's really a quagmire," said Ted Clark, executive director of the Northeastern University Center for Family Business.
16241	NYT_ENG_20070223.0174.LDC2009T13	"We hear all the time: I never want to sell."
16242	NYT_ENG_20070223.0174.LDC2009T13	Thus three years ago, the Padnoses began talking to the managers about taking on more responsibility and perhaps one day running the company.
16243	NYT_ENG_20070223.0174.LDC2009T13	"The first thing they all said was, 'OK, when?"'
16244	NYT_ENG_20070223.0174.LDC2009T13	said Shelley Padnos, Mitch's sister.
16245	NYT_ENG_20070223.0174.LDC2009T13	She went to a business ethics seminar two years ago and met the speaker, Michael DeWilde.
16246	NYT_ENG_20070223.0174.LDC2009T13	He teaches philosophy at Grand Valley State.
16247	NYT_ENG_20070223.0174.LDC2009T13	A former carpenter and labor organizer, he became known in the Grand Rapids area for a program that brought literary classics to groups that normally do not read them, including some prisoners.
16248	NYT_ENG_20070223.0174.LDC2009T13	Shelley Padnos was impressed, and invited DeWilde to meet with the managers.
16249	NYT_ENG_20070223.0174.LDC2009T13	They communicated poorly with one another, often running problems through a family member, she said.
16250	NYT_ENG_20070223.0174.LDC2009T13	She said she felt they were uncomfortable with ambiguity and saw issues as black and white.
16251	NYT_ENG_20070223.0174.LDC2009T13	And she worried their conservatism would change the way Padnos was run.
16252	NYT_ENG_20070223.0174.LDC2009T13	"They would tell you, 'God helps them who help themselves,"' she said.
16253	NYT_ENG_20070223.0174.LDC2009T13	In her view, though, "that only works if the playing field is level."
16254	NYT_ENG_20070223.0174.LDC2009T13	"They need to be exposed to the big wide world," Shelley Padnos recalled thinking.
16255	NYT_ENG_20070223.0174.LDC2009T13	"It is not unusual to grow up in Holland and think most of the world is Christian Reformed and white."
16256	NYT_ENG_20070223.0174.LDC2009T13	The managers, mostly in their 30s, grew up in the area, went to college and, after a job or two, came to Padnos.
16257	NYT_ENG_20070223.0174.LDC2009T13	Al Tomes, director of operations and a 16-year Padnos employee, grew up in a one-stoplight town near here, where his parents operated a campground, he said.
16258	NYT_ENG_20070223.0174.LDC2009T13	(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
16259	NYT_ENG_20070223.0174.LDC2009T13	Before enlisting in the Army and graduating from college, Tomes said, he mulled a career at his hometown grocery store.
16260	NYT_ENG_20070223.0174.LDC2009T13	But he decided he would always be beneath the owner's several children.
16261	NYT_ENG_20070223.0174.LDC2009T13	"There just wasn't going to be room," he said.
16262	NYT_ENG_20070223.0174.LDC2009T13	Perhaps it is too easy for the Padnoses to think of the managers as still-developing personalities, rather than merely as fellow adults with a different point of view.
16263	NYT_ENG_20070223.0174.LDC2009T13	"We all came in here young," said Matthew Heitmeier, a manager who buys and sells metals for Padnos.
16264	NYT_ENG_20070223.0174.LDC2009T13	"It's a parent-child relationship.
16265	NYT_ENG_20070223.0174.LDC2009T13	I don't think we're as closed-minded as they think we are.
16266	NYT_ENG_20070223.0174.LDC2009T13	They hire conservative people.
16267	NYT_ENG_20070223.0174.LDC2009T13	They want us to appreciate the liberal mindset."
16268	NYT_ENG_20070223.0174.LDC2009T13	(END OPTIONAL TRIM)
16269	NYT_ENG_20070223.0174.LDC2009T13	When DeWilde, the professor, started meeting with the managers every two weeks in September 2005, he said they initially focused on traditional career concerns.
16270	NYT_ENG_20070223.0174.LDC2009T13	Some saw the meetings as a way to advance themselves as candidates to run the company.
16271	NYT_ENG_20070223.0174.LDC2009T13	Over time, however, they were convinced that the Padnoses had no intention of naming a single heir apparent.
16272	NYT_ENG_20070223.0174.LDC2009T13	The four family members practice an unusually democratic management.
16273	NYT_ENG_20070223.0174.LDC2009T13	Each is paid exactly the same, and no major decision is made unless all four agree.
16274	NYT_ENG_20070223.0174.LDC2009T13	Beginning to think like a team, the managers offered each other constructive criticism.
16275	NYT_ENG_20070223.0174.LDC2009T13	They told Scott O'Neil, the sales manager, that he shoots from the hip at times.
16276	NYT_ENG_20070223.0174.LDC2009T13	They told Al Tomes to dress more nicely and work on his grammar.
16277	NYT_ENG_20070223.0174.LDC2009T13	And O'Neil told Timothy Beers, who manages administrative functions, to stop hanging around the office into the evening just because Jeff Padnos stays late.
16278	NYT_ENG_20070223.0174.LDC2009T13	"Tim was always there," O'Neil said.
16279	NYT_ENG_20070223.0174.LDC2009T13	Beers denied hanging around unnecessarily.
16280	NYT_ENG_20070223.0174.LDC2009T13	The managers were assigned readings of Thoreau, Sophocles and a recent essay on Freud.
16281	NYT_ENG_20070223.0174.LDC2009T13	They spent a long weekend in Chicago seeing plays, touring exhibitions of art and architecture and eating at fancy restaurants.
16282	NYT_ENG_20070223.0174.LDC2009T13	And in recent weeks they have debated how to give away $40,000 of the Padnos' money, an exercise in becoming philanthropists.
16283	NYT_ENG_20070223.0174.LDC2009T13	Beers, a 12-year Padnos employee, said, "I've enjoyed it.
16284	NYT_ENG_20070223.0174.LDC2009T13	But it hasn't been an easy transition.
16285	NYT_ENG_20070223.0174.LDC2009T13	While you're sitting there watching a Shakespeare play, it's hard not to think about all the things you could be getting done at work."

16288	NYT_ENG_20070223.0174.LDC2009T13	The founder, Louis Padnos, fled Russia at age 13, made his way to Amsterdam, Netherlands, learned to speak Dutch and got on a ship to the United States.
16289	NYT_ENG_20070223.0174.LDC2009T13	He had relatives in Chicago.
16290	NYT_ENG_20070223.0174.LDC2009T13	He became a junk peddler, common work among Dutch immigrants at the time.
16291	NYT_ENG_20070223.0174.LDC2009T13	Because he did not speak English, someone suggested that he move across Lake Michigan to Holland, the Dutch enclave.
16292	NYT_ENG_20070223.0174.LDC2009T13	From a cart and later a horse and wagon, his business prospered.
16293	NYT_ENG_20070223.0174.LDC2009T13	He essentially scoured the area for scrap metal and other discards, then sold the stuff to mills as raw material.
16294	NYT_ENG_20070223.0174.LDC2009T13	Two sons joined and expanded the business.
16295	NYT_ENG_20070223.0174.LDC2009T13	By 1979, Mitch and Jeff Padnos, cousins, joined their fathers.
16296	NYT_ENG_20070223.0174.LDC2009T13	Shelley and Jeff's brother, Doug Padnos, joined later.
16297	NYT_ENG_20070223.0174.LDC2009T13	It remains a tough business, and it is dangerous.
16298	NYT_ENG_20070223.0174.LDC2009T13	Two workers died at Padnos plants in recent years.
16299	NYT_ENG_20070223.0174.LDC2009T13	One was hit last year by a giant blade he was changing on a metal shredder.
16300	NYT_ENG_20070223.0174.LDC2009T13	The other was run over in 2001 by a freight train as he swept scraps away from the tracks.
16301	NYT_ENG_20070223.0174.LDC2009T13	Scrap prices, meanwhile, move wildly, and a dealer stuck with a lot of inventory in a plunging market can be wiped out.
16302	NYT_ENG_20070223.0174.LDC2009T13	Padnos will not disclose profits on its annual sales of about $300 million.
16303	NYT_ENG_20070223.0174.LDC2009T13	However, if its profit margin last year roughly matched the industry's biggest company, Metal Management, Padnos could have had after-tax profit of $15 million to $20 million.
16304	NYT_ENG_20070223.0174.LDC2009T13	The managers, implored to "act like owners," do not see the financial statements, and that irks some of them.
16305	NYT_ENG_20070223.0174.LDC2009T13	"If they want these people to be more like them, they need to have access to the same information," said Clark, the Northeastern University family business director.
16306	NYT_ENG_20070223.0174.LDC2009T13	Without the context of financial information, he added, the managers cannot be expected to make informed decisions.
16307	NYT_ENG_20070223.0174.LDC2009T13	"It's an inconsistency," Jeff Padnos conceded.

16312	NYT_ENG_20070225.0087.LDC2009T13	Gerard Way had ordered his band to stop, and now he was holding forth on concert etiquette.
16313	NYT_ENG_20070225.0087.LDC2009T13	"If somebody -- even one person -- falls down, everybody around them stops what they're doing and picks them up off the ground."
16314	NYT_ENG_20070225.0087.LDC2009T13	Did the fans agree?
16315	NYT_ENG_20070225.0087.LDC2009T13	They did.
16316	NYT_ENG_20070225.0087.LDC2009T13	So the music came roaring back.
16317	NYT_ENG_20070225.0087.LDC2009T13	Way is the lead singer of My Chemical Romance, and Friday's concert, at Nassau Coliseum on Long Island, was the second stop on the band's biggest tour yet.
16318	NYT_ENG_20070225.0087.LDC2009T13	The building was full -- though not completely full -- of cheerful teenagers, singing along to every funereal word.
16319	NYT_ENG_20070225.0087.LDC2009T13	And Way, who will be 30 in April, was the sweetly solicitous ringleader, clearly happy to be singing these grand emo songs in the place they really belong: an arena.
16320	NYT_ENG_20070225.0087.LDC2009T13	My Chemical Romance never seemed small, though the band did not always seem quite this big.
16321	NYT_ENG_20070225.0087.LDC2009T13	After a jittery (and pretty great) 2002 debut album, "I Brought You My Bullets, You Brought Me Your Love" (Eyeball), the members created a brawnier, catchier follow- up, 2004's "Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge" (Reprise).
16322	NYT_ENG_20070225.0087.LDC2009T13	Way balanced violence ("This is how we like to do it in the murder scene") with sentiment ("I miss you more than I did yesterday"), and the CD spawned a couple of big hits.
16323	NYT_ENG_20070225.0087.LDC2009T13	During Friday's concert My Chemical Romance saved the "Three Cheers" songs for the second half.
16324	NYT_ENG_20070225.0087.LDC2009T13	The set began with Way on a gurney, singing, "Now come one, come all to this tragic affair."
16325	NYT_ENG_20070225.0087.LDC2009T13	Those are the first lines from the most recent My Chemical Romance CD, "Welcome to the Black Parade" (Reprise), and for the next hour the members played that terrific album in its entirety.
16326	NYT_ENG_20070225.0087.LDC2009T13	In their short black-and-silver jackets, the band members looked like bellhops, and they claimed they were a different band entirely.
16327	NYT_ENG_20070225.0087.LDC2009T13	"We are the Black Parade," said Way, as the concert's first half ended.
16328	NYT_ENG_20070225.0087.LDC2009T13	"My Chemical Romance will be up next."
16329	NYT_ENG_20070225.0087.LDC2009T13	It is a ridiculous distinction, but maybe a useful one, and not just because it gives the guys an excuse to wear matching outfits.
16330	NYT_ENG_20070225.0087.LDC2009T13	It is a way for the band members to avoid feeling self- conscious about a piano ballad called, "Cancer," or a hair- metallic anthem like "The Sharpest Lives."
16331	NYT_ENG_20070225.0087.LDC2009T13	And while there were a few awkward moments (like the black-and- white blimps that inflated and then, just as inexplicably, deflated), the overall effect was impressive.
16332	NYT_ENG_20070225.0087.LDC2009T13	Rather than getting self-conscious about fame, these guys just concentrated on writing songs as big as their audience: songs that sound just as good, or maybe better, when the band has stopped and the house lights are on and the crowd is singing the chorus.

16334	NYT_ENG_20070228.0271.LDC2009T13	AUSTIN, Texas
16335	NYT_ENG_20070228.0271.LDC2009T13	Gov. Rick Perry on Wednesday ousted the chairman of the Texas Youth Commission over charges that the agency covered up the sexual abuse of incarcerated juveniles.
16336	NYT_ENG_20070228.0271.LDC2009T13	Perry also called for removal of the acting executive director, appointment of an independent inspector general, and a shakeup throughout the commission, which runs 13 schools housing some 3,000 felons under 21.
16337	NYT_ENG_20070228.0271.LDC2009T13	"Leadership starts at the top, and the governor believes the very top leadership has failed," a spokesman, Ted Royer, said.
16338	NYT_ENG_20070228.0271.LDC2009T13	Late Wednesday, the State Senate went back into session to debate a stronger response to the allegations.
16339	NYT_ENG_20070228.0271.LDC2009T13	On Tuesday, the State Senate Criminal Justice Committee aired details of long-secret investigations by the youth commission and the Texas Rangers showing that two supervisors at the West Texas State School in remote Pyote routinely roused boys from their beds for sexual encounters that were reported but went unpunished by the school's superintendent, who now holds a top leadership position at the commission.
16340	NYT_ENG_20070228.0271.LDC2009T13	The supervisors were allowed to resign without facing criminal charges, but are now under investigation.
16341	NYT_ENG_20070228.0271.LDC2009T13	The dismissed chairman, Pete C. Alfaro, is a former mayor of Baytown who was first named to the commission in 1995 by Gov. George W. Bush and was appointed chairman by Perry in 2004.
16342	NYT_ENG_20070228.0271.LDC2009T13	Alfaro did not respond to messages seeking comment.
16343	NYT_ENG_20070228.0271.LDC2009T13	His latest five-year term was to expire in August.
16344	NYT_ENG_20070228.0271.LDC2009T13	Hours after the governor's spokesman said that Alfaro had been told by phone that he was being replaced by his vice chairman, Donald R. Bethel, a spokesman for the Texas Youth Commission, Tim Savoy, said that the agency had still received no notice of the action.
16345	NYT_ENG_20070228.0271.LDC2009T13	The board has a meeting scheduled for next Tuesday.
16346	NYT_ENG_20070228.0271.LDC2009T13	Perry, a Republican, also called on the remaining six board members to replace the acting executive director, Neil Nichols, who is the general counsel and a 33-year veteran of the agency.
16347	NYT_ENG_20070228.0271.LDC2009T13	Nichols took over last Friday upon the sudden retirement of the executive director, Dwight Harris, who started as a caseworker in 1981.
16348	NYT_ENG_20070228.0271.LDC2009T13	The governor said that Ed Owens, deputy executive director of the Texas Department of Criminal Justice, had agreed to serve as the commission's acting executive director.
16349	NYT_ENG_20070228.0271.LDC2009T13	Though the governor makes appointments to the seven-member board, he has the power by himself only to remove the chairman, legal experts said.
16350	NYT_ENG_20070228.0271.LDC2009T13	He can fire other members upon a finding of gross fiscal mismanagement by a legislative audit committee made up of the two legislative leaders, Lt. Gov.

16351	NYT_ENG_20070228.0271.LDC2009T13	Dewhurst on Wednesday demanded sweeping changes in the commission.
16352	NYT_ENG_20070228.0271.LDC2009T13	Sen. John Whitmire, a Houston Democrat and chairman of the criminal justice committee that heard the cover-up allegations, said Wednesday "I have no confidence in the board" but that Perry was not yet ready to seek its ouster.

16354	NYT_ENG_20070303.0154.LDC2009T13	WASHINGTON
16355	NYT_ENG_20070303.0154.LDC2009T13	A few hours after meeting a former KGB general outside a spy museum here, an outspoken critic of the Kremlin became engulfed in the kind of intrigue he studies when was shot Thursday outside his suburban Maryland home.
16356	NYT_ENG_20070303.0154.LDC2009T13	The shooting occurred four days after the critic, Paul M. Joyal, warned on "Dateline NBC," the television news magazine, that a "message has been communicated to anyone who wants to speak out against the Kremlin: 'If you do, no matter who you are, where you are, we will find you and we will silence you in the most horrible way possible."
16357	NYT_ENG_20070303.0154.LDC2009T13	Joyal was speaking about the poisoning of Alexander V. Litvinenko, a KGB defector, who was poisoned last fall in London.
16358	NYT_ENG_20070303.0154.LDC2009T13	A spokesman for the Prince George's County police department declined to say whether the police viewed the shooting as a reprisal or a coincidence.
16359	NYT_ENG_20070303.0154.LDC2009T13	The spokesman, Corp.
16360	NYT_ENG_20070303.0154.LDC2009T13	Clinton Copeland, said the police had "a vague description of two black males" fleeing the scene.
16361	NYT_ENG_20070303.0154.LDC2009T13	Federal authorities were leaning toward the view that Joyal was the victim of a street crime unrelated to his opinions of Russia, said a federal law enforcement official.
16362	NYT_ENG_20070303.0154.LDC2009T13	The official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the investigation is incomplete, said the crime scene did not point toward professional assassins.
16363	NYT_ENG_20070303.0154.LDC2009T13	Joyal, 53, who was shot in the groin outside his home in Adelphi, Md., was in stable condition on Saturday, the police said.
16364	NYT_ENG_20070303.0154.LDC2009T13	Joyal was an aide on the Senate Intelligence Committee from 1980 to 1989 and edited a business newsletter about Russia throughout the 1990s.
16365	NYT_ENG_20070303.0154.LDC2009T13	He has criticized President Vladimir Putin of Russia for reversing democratic reforms and was quoted several years.
16366	NYT_ENG_20070303.0154.LDC2009T13	In the mid-1990s, Joyal went into business with Oleg Kalugin, a former KGB general who became a leading KGB critic and moved to Washington.
16367	NYT_ENG_20070303.0154.LDC2009T13	The venture failed.
16368	NYT_ENG_20070303.0154.LDC2009T13	They met Thursday afternoon at a restaurant next to the International Spy Museum in downtown Washington.
16369	NYT_ENG_20070303.0154.LDC2009T13	Soon after Joyal arrived home at 7:30, Kalugin got a panicked call from Joyal's wife, Elizabeth, who had found her husband shot in the driveway.
16370	NYT_ENG_20070303.0154.LDC2009T13	"She called me and said, 'Oleg, Paul is shot, I want to warn you,"' Kalugin said.
16371	NYT_ENG_20070303.0154.LDC2009T13	"I couldn't believe my ears."
16372	NYT_ENG_20070303.0154.LDC2009T13	Despite Elizabeth Joyal's warning and his dim view of the KGB, Kalugin said "my suspicion is that it's not linked to anything international."
16373	NYT_ENG_20070303.0154.LDC2009T13	As described, he said, the crime did not bear the fingerprints of Russian agents.
16374	NYT_ENG_20070303.0154.LDC2009T13	He also said their enemies' list had more prominent names on it than that of Joyal.
16375	NYT_ENG_20070303.0154.LDC2009T13	Joyal was featured prominently in the "Dateline NBC" segment about Litvinenko, who died in November after ingesting a rare radioactive substance called Polonium 210, the bulk of which comes from Russia.

16378	NYT_ENG_20070306.0111.LDC2009T13	Cox News Service
16379	NYT_ENG_20070306.0111.LDC2009T13	WASHINGTON - President Bush announced a bipartisan commission Tuesday to review the care given wounded war veterans, while senators called top Army officials to account for a medical system that has put the soldiers into squalid housing and bureaucratic limbo.
16380	NYT_ENG_20070306.0111.LDC2009T13	In the latest response to the unfolding scandal that began with media reports of neglect in the outpatient services at Walter Reed Medical Center in the nation's capital, the president told an American Legion gathering that the treatment of the returning troops was "unacceptable to our country."
16381	NYT_ENG_20070306.0111.LDC2009T13	"I am as concerned as you are about the conditions," Bush said.
16382	NYT_ENG_20070306.0111.LDC2009T13	"My decisions have put our kids in harm's way."
16383	NYT_ENG_20070306.0111.LDC2009T13	He appointed former Sen. Bob Dole, a Republican, and Donna Shalala, a Democrat who served as secretary of health and human services, to head the review panel.
16384	NYT_ENG_20070306.0111.LDC2009T13	The commission is charged with improving the delivery of health care and benefits and easing the transition of wounded personnel back into military service or into civilian life.
16385	NYT_ENG_20070306.0111.LDC2009T13	The president also ordered the Department of Veterans Affairs to set up a task force to find gaps in services for "returning global war on terror heroes."
16386	NYT_ENG_20070306.0111.LDC2009T13	At the same time, senior military leaders were on the congressional hot seat for the second day in a row.
16387	NYT_ENG_20070306.0111.LDC2009T13	Members of the Senate Armed Services Committee asked a panel that include the Army chief of staff how serious problems in the medical system had escaped their attention.
16388	NYT_ENG_20070306.0111.LDC2009T13	Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., who chaired the hearing, promised a bipartisan effort to fix the defects.
16389	NYT_ENG_20070306.0111.LDC2009T13	"How can we as a nation ask our young men and women to serve, and when they're wounded ... put them in a position where they are scared to death that we will not take proper care of them and their families?"
16390	NYT_ENG_20070306.0111.LDC2009T13	he asked.
16391	NYT_ENG_20070306.0111.LDC2009T13	Sen. John McCain of Arizona, and Sen. Saxby Chambliss of Georgia, both Republicans, challenged Army officials to explain why they failed to learn lessons from a similar scandal at Fort Stewart, Ga., three years ago.
16392	NYT_ENG_20070306.0111.LDC2009T13	"This is not the first time this has happened," Chambliss said, citing revelations of substandard housing and slow follow-up for medical services for troops returning from Iraq in 2003.
16393	NYT_ENG_20070306.0111.LDC2009T13	Chambliss said the Army remedied the Fort Stewart shortfalls and "assured us, and I quote, 'What we learned from this incident is going to help the Army when we have other major units returning from Operation Iraqi Freedom.' "
16394	NYT_ENG_20070306.0111.LDC2009T13	McCain said the Walter Reed conditions, made public in a series of Washington Post articles quoting outpatients, were "even more troubling because we had reason to believe" the Army had made corrections after the Fort Stewart issues surfaced.
16395	NYT_ENG_20070306.0111.LDC2009T13	Gen. Peter Schoomaker, the Army chief of staff, said that conditions have changed in the past few years as new waves of troops return with multiple and more serious wounds as a result of the improvised explosive devices set off by insurgents in Iraq.
16396	NYT_ENG_20070306.0111.LDC2009T13	"This is by far a more complex problem that we're facing here" at Walter Reed, Schoomaker said.
16397	NYT_ENG_20070306.0111.LDC2009T13	As the top uniformed officer in the Army, "I stand before you accountable for what has occurred," Schoomaker said.
16398	NYT_ENG_20070306.0111.LDC2009T13	He outlined steps the military was taking to improve medical services for those who are wounded.
16399	NYT_ENG_20070306.0111.LDC2009T13	For example, the Army announced it would visit 11 bases to study the care and information given to patients.
16400	NYT_ENG_20070306.0111.LDC2009T13	They include Winn Army Community Hospital at Fort Stewart
16401	NYT_ENG_20070306.0111.LDC2009T13	Eisenhower Army Medical Center at Fort Gordon, Ga.
16402	NYT_ENG_20070306.0111.LDC2009T13	Darnall Army Community Hospital at Fort Hood, Texas
16403	NYT_ENG_20070306.0111.LDC2009T13	Brooke Army Medical Center at Fort Sam Houston, Texas, and Beaumont Army Medical Center at Fort Bliss, Texas.
16404	NYT_ENG_20070306.0111.LDC2009T13	Schoomaker also blamed a "bureaucratic morass" for the medical care system's failures.
16405	NYT_ENG_20070306.0111.LDC2009T13	"Life every day in this system is like running in hip boots in a swamp," he said.
16406	NYT_ENG_20070306.0111.LDC2009T13	Lawmakers and military officials agreed that the military faces a new set of conditions, starting with heroic battlefield medical efforts that have saved many more wounded soldiers than in past wars but have left them with life-altering injuries requiring more services and counseling.
16407	NYT_ENG_20070306.0111.LDC2009T13	Some lawmakers, including Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton, D-N.Y., faulted recent efforts to privatize some of the services at Walter Reed, where the changeover from federal employees to contract workers left the support staff temporarily undermanned.
16408	NYT_ENG_20070306.0111.LDC2009T13	Several lawmakers have also questioned Congress' decision to close Walter Reed and merge its services with those at the naval hospital at Bethesda, Md.
16409	NYT_ENG_20070306.0111.LDC2009T13	(Optional add follows)
16410	NYT_ENG_20070306.0111.LDC2009T13	Some of the toughest questions Tuesday were aimed at Lt. Gen. Kevin C. Kiley, the Army's surgeon general, whose home is across the street from Walter Reed's now-infamous Building 18, a barracks for recuperating soldiers that had moldy walls and an infestation of rodents.
16411	NYT_ENG_20070306.0111.LDC2009T13	"I obviously didn't check enough on what was happening at Walter Reed," said Kiley, who served as commander of the medical center before moving to his current post.
16412	NYT_ENG_20070306.0111.LDC2009T13	Kiley tried to make amends for his remarks at a House hearing Monday that it was not his job to inspect barracks.
16413	NYT_ENG_20070306.0111.LDC2009T13	"It was not my intent to shed responsibility," Kiley told the senators.
16414	NYT_ENG_20070306.0111.LDC2009T13	Freshman Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., read an e-mail from a soldier at Walter Reed who had lost both legs and who said Kiley should resign because he had known about serious problems within the medical system and "swept them under the rug."
16415	NYT_ENG_20070306.0111.LDC2009T13	McCaskill accused Kiley of trying to "diminish the severity of the problem" by using a survey taken last month indicating that less than 3 percent of the outpatient soldiers had complaints about the administrative process.
16416	NYT_ENG_20070306.0111.LDC2009T13	"You don't really believe that only 3 percent of the outpatients had complaints, do you?"
16417	NYT_ENG_20070306.0111.LDC2009T13	McCaskill asked.
16418	NYT_ENG_20070306.0111.LDC2009T13	"I think that was General (George) Weightman's testimony, senator, not mine," Kiley replied, referring to the just-fired commander of Walter Reed who testified Monday before a House investigating committee.
16419	NYT_ENG_20070306.0111.LDC2009T13	The senator fired back: "This is your statement that you provided to the committee today."

16428	NYT_ENG_20070310.0013.LDC2009T13	PALM HARBOR Amid the congratulations that accompanied the announcement more than a year ago that Tampa Bay's PGA Tour event would be moving to the spring was plenty of concern.
16429	NYT_ENG_20070310.0013.LDC2009T13	The folks at Innisbrook are proud of the Copperhead course that has been ranked among the state's best for three decades.
16430	NYT_ENG_20070310.0013.LDC2009T13	And they were a bit perturbed at the prospect of seeing the world's best golfers take advantage of what many believed could be a vulnerable layout.
16431	NYT_ENG_20070310.0013.LDC2009T13	So much for that.
16432	NYT_ENG_20070310.0013.LDC2009T13	Through two rounds of the PODS Championship, the Copperhead course is every bit as difficult as it was in October.
16433	NYT_ENG_20070310.0013.LDC2009T13	Perhaps more so.
16434	NYT_ENG_20070310.0013.LDC2009T13	The lead through 36 holes was 6 under par exactly where it was through one round, and two strokes higher than in October at the halfway point of the $5.3-million tournament.
16435	NYT_ENG_20070310.0013.LDC2009T13	"It's kind of got a major (championship)-type feel," said Chris DiMarco, whose 69 Friday put him two shots behind leader Stephen Leaney.
16436	NYT_ENG_20070310.0013.LDC2009T13	"And it's only going to get tougher."
16437	NYT_ENG_20070310.0013.LDC2009T13	Leaney's 4-under 67 matched the lowest score of the day and included a 45-foot birdie putt on the 18th hole, which put him at 136, one stroke ahead of Heath Slocum.
16438	NYT_ENG_20070310.0013.LDC2009T13	Another shot back were DiMarco, Pat Perez, Doug LaBelle, Vaughn Taylor, Daniel Chopra, Jonathan Byrd and defending champion K.J. Choi.
16439	NYT_ENG_20070310.0013.LDC2009T13	Choi finished at 13 under in October, the only player to reach double digits for the tournament.
16440	NYT_ENG_20070310.0013.LDC2009T13	First-round leader Cliff Kresge shot 74 and was tied for 10th, three strokes back.
16441	NYT_ENG_20070310.0013.LDC2009T13	Kresge got to 8 under through 11 holes Thursday after the second of his two eagles and nobody has gotten close to that number since.
16442	NYT_ENG_20070310.0013.LDC2009T13	He bogeyed two holes coming in and kept his lead all morning as players fired and missed.
16443	NYT_ENG_20070310.0013.LDC2009T13	"I did not consider that the fairways would be slow," Innisbrook's director of golf, Jay Overton, said.
16444	NYT_ENG_20070310.0013.LDC2009T13	"The rye grass has kept them slower and made the ball stop rolling so much.
16445	NYT_ENG_20070310.0013.LDC2009T13	Some players have told me they're hitting much longer shots to the greens than in the fall."
16446	NYT_ENG_20070310.0013.LDC2009T13	Since October, the resort initiated its typical overseeding program with a rye grass meant to keep the place looking green when the Bermuda grass went dormant.
16447	NYT_ENG_20070310.0013.LDC2009T13	Overton, among others, figured it would perhaps make the course play easier, because the rough would not be as thick.

16455	NYT_ENG_20070310.0013.LDC2009T13	You have to be careful."
16456	NYT_ENG_20070310.0013.LDC2009T13	Moore was not the only player to struggle coming in.

16476	NYT_ENG_20070310.0157.LDC2009T13	FORT MYERS, Fla. - When Red Sox prospect Jacoby Ellsbury was at Oregon State, he used wooden bats during batting practice, saving his aluminum hacks for the games.
16477	NYT_ENG_20070310.0157.LDC2009T13	That is one of the more obvious clues he had his sights on loftier goals.
16478	NYT_ENG_20070310.0157.LDC2009T13	"From a young age, I always wanted to play pro ball," Ellsbury said.
16479	NYT_ENG_20070310.0157.LDC2009T13	"We all know the sweet spot is smaller on a wooden bat, so it helped me prepare better, use my hands more.
16480	NYT_ENG_20070310.0157.LDC2009T13	When I got in the game with the aluminum bat, it seemed easier."
16481	NYT_ENG_20070310.0157.LDC2009T13	There is little about baseball that has appeared difficult for Ellsbury, who took some swings at Fenway Park with some other Cape Cod Leaguers in 2004, never imagining that a year later he'd be drafted on the first round by the Sox.
16482	NYT_ENG_20070310.0157.LDC2009T13	"Someone has a picture," he said, "of me in the cage, with Theo [Epstein] watching."
16483	NYT_ENG_20070310.0157.LDC2009T13	Last year, his first full season in pro ball, was almost a year- round enterprise.
16484	NYT_ENG_20070310.0157.LDC2009T13	He started with Single A Wilmington, was promoted to Double A Portland in July, went to the playoffs with the Sea Dogs as they won the Eastern League title, then went to the Arizona Fall League, where he played another 26 games.
16485	NYT_ENG_20070310.0157.LDC2009T13	Ellsbury led all Sox minor leaguers with 41 stolen bases and was third in hitting with a .303 average, just behind Dustin Pedroia (.305) at Pawtucket and Jeff Natale (.304) at Wilmington.
16486	NYT_ENG_20070310.0157.LDC2009T13	He also made just two errors in 109 games in the outfield.
16487	NYT_ENG_20070310.0157.LDC2009T13	"Some of his physical skills are obvious," said Ben Cherington, the Sox vice president of player personnel.
16488	NYT_ENG_20070310.0157.LDC2009T13	"He's a fast runner with a quick burst - he gets to top speed quickly.
16489	NYT_ENG_20070310.0157.LDC2009T13	He has instincts in the outfield, and his arm strength has improved remarkably.
16490	NYT_ENG_20070310.0157.LDC2009T13	"But the thing that impresses me about him is his efficiency of movement.
16491	NYT_ENG_20070310.0157.LDC2009T13	Some guys have a way of making the game look hard, a way of making it look difficult, but he keeps things pretty simple.
16492	NYT_ENG_20070310.0157.LDC2009T13	"There's not a lot of unnecessary movement.
16493	NYT_ENG_20070310.0157.LDC2009T13	When you combine that with his athleticism, he has a chance to be very good."
16494	NYT_ENG_20070310.0157.LDC2009T13	Ellsbury hit just 7 home runs in 442 at-bats last season, but Cherington said he can see his power evolving naturally.
16495	NYT_ENG_20070310.0157.LDC2009T13	No one is saying he'll be a slugger, but double-digit home runs should be within reach.
16496	NYT_ENG_20070310.0157.LDC2009T13	"The focus going into the season will be on the nuances involved with becoming a really good leadoff hitter," Cherington said.
16497	NYT_ENG_20070310.0157.LDC2009T13	"Learning to grind out every at-bat, understanding the strike zone, and being even more disciplined than he already is."
16498	NYT_ENG_20070310.0157.LDC2009T13	The Sox also plan to have base-running and outfield instructor Lou Frazier, along with special instructor Tommy Harper, work with Ellsbury on his base-stealing skills.
16499	NYT_ENG_20070310.0157.LDC2009T13	Frazier will be entrusted with refining Ellsbury's skills in the outfield, too.

16501	NYT_ENG_20070312.0107.LDC2009T13	LOS ANGELES
16502	NYT_ENG_20070312.0107.LDC2009T13	Four hundred people packed into an auditorium at UCLA in January to listen to a public lecture on prime numbers, one of the rare occasions that the topic has drawn a standing-room-only audience.
16503	NYT_ENG_20070312.0107.LDC2009T13	Another 35 people watched on a video screen in a classroom next door.
16504	NYT_ENG_20070312.0107.LDC2009T13	Eighty people were turned away.
16505	NYT_ENG_20070312.0107.LDC2009T13	The speaker, Terence Tao, a professor of mathematics at the university, promised "a whirlwind tour, the equivalent to going through Paris and just seeing the Eiffel Tower and the Arc de Triomphe."
16506	NYT_ENG_20070312.0107.LDC2009T13	His words were polite, unassuming and tinged with the accent of Australia, his homeland.
16507	NYT_ENG_20070312.0107.LDC2009T13	Even though prime numbers have been studied for 2,000 years, "There's still a lot that needs to be done," Tao said.
16508	NYT_ENG_20070312.0107.LDC2009T13	"And it's still a very exciting field."
16509	NYT_ENG_20070312.0107.LDC2009T13	After Tao finished his one-hour talk, which was broadcast live on the Internet, several students came down to the front and asked for autographs.
16510	NYT_ENG_20070312.0107.LDC2009T13	Tao has drawn attention and curiosity throughout his life for his prodigious abilities.
16511	NYT_ENG_20070312.0107.LDC2009T13	By age 2, he had learned to read.
16512	NYT_ENG_20070312.0107.LDC2009T13	At 9, he attended college math classes.
16513	NYT_ENG_20070312.0107.LDC2009T13	At 20, he finished his Ph.D.
16514	NYT_ENG_20070312.0107.LDC2009T13	Now 31, he has grown from prodigy to one of the world's top mathematicians, tackling an unusually broad range of problems, including ones involving prime numbers and the compression of images.
16515	NYT_ENG_20070312.0107.LDC2009T13	Last summer, he won a Fields Medal, often considered the Nobel Prize of mathematics, and a MacArthur Fellowship, the "genius" award that comes with $500,000 and no strings.
16516	NYT_ENG_20070312.0107.LDC2009T13	"He's wonderful," said Charles Fefferman of Princeton University, himself a former child prodigy and a Fields Medalist.
16517	NYT_ENG_20070312.0107.LDC2009T13	"He's as good as they come.
16518	NYT_ENG_20070312.0107.LDC2009T13	There are a few in a generation, and he's one of the few."
16519	NYT_ENG_20070312.0107.LDC2009T13	Colleagues have teasingly called Tao a rock star and the Mozart of Math.
16520	NYT_ENG_20070312.0107.LDC2009T13	Two museums in Australia have requested his photograph for their permanent exhibits.
16521	NYT_ENG_20070312.0107.LDC2009T13	And he was a finalist for the 2007 Australian of the Year award.
16522	NYT_ENG_20070312.0107.LDC2009T13	"You start getting famous for being famous," Tao said.
16523	NYT_ENG_20070312.0107.LDC2009T13	"The Paris Hilton effect."
16524	NYT_ENG_20070312.0107.LDC2009T13	Not that any of that has noticeably affected him.
16525	NYT_ENG_20070312.0107.LDC2009T13	His campus office is adorned with a poster of "Ranma 1/2," a Japanese comic book.
16526	NYT_ENG_20070312.0107.LDC2009T13	As he walks the halls of the math building, he might be wearing an Adidas sweatshirt, blue jeans and scruffy sneakers, looking much like one of his graduate students.
16527	NYT_ENG_20070312.0107.LDC2009T13	He said he did not know how he would spend the MacArthur money, though he mentioned the mortgage on the house that he and his wife, Laura, an engineer at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory, bought last year.
16528	NYT_ENG_20070312.0107.LDC2009T13	After a childhood in Adelaide, Australia, and graduate school at Princeton, Tao has settled into sunny Southern California.
16529	NYT_ENG_20070312.0107.LDC2009T13	"I love it a lot," he said.
16530	NYT_ENG_20070312.0107.LDC2009T13	But not necessarily for what the area offers.
16531	NYT_ENG_20070312.0107.LDC2009T13	"It's sort of the absence of things I like," he said.
16532	NYT_ENG_20070312.0107.LDC2009T13	No snow to shovel, for instance.
16533	NYT_ENG_20070312.0107.LDC2009T13	A deluge of media attention following his Fields Medal last summer has slowed to a trickle, and Tao said he was happy that his fame might be fleeting so that he could again concentrate on math.
16534	NYT_ENG_20070312.0107.LDC2009T13	One area of his research -- compressed sensing -- could have real-world use.
16535	NYT_ENG_20070312.0107.LDC2009T13	Digital cameras use millions of sensors to record an image, and then a computer chip in the compresses the data.
16536	NYT_ENG_20070312.0107.LDC2009T13	"Compressed sensing is a different strategy," Tao said.
16537	NYT_ENG_20070312.0107.LDC2009T13	"You also compress the data, but you try to do it in a very dumb way, one that doesn't require much computer power at the sensor end."

16539	NYT_ENG_20070312.0107.LDC2009T13	With Emmanuel Candes, a professor of applied and computational mathematics at the California Institute of Technology, Tao showed that even if most of the information were immediately discarded, the use of powerful algorithms could still reconstruct the original image.
16540	NYT_ENG_20070312.0107.LDC2009T13	By useful coincidence, Tao's son, William, and Candes' son attended the same preschool, so dropping off their children turned into useful work time.
16541	NYT_ENG_20070312.0107.LDC2009T13	"We'd meet each other every morning at preschool," Tao said, "and we'd catch up on what we had done."
16542	NYT_ENG_20070312.0107.LDC2009T13	The military is interested in using the work for reconnaissance: blanket a battlefield with simple, cheap cameras that might each record a single pixel of data.
16543	NYT_ENG_20070312.0107.LDC2009T13	Each camera would transmit the data to a central computer that, using the mathematical technique developed by Tao and Candes, would construct a comprehensive view.
16544	NYT_ENG_20070312.0107.LDC2009T13	Engineers at Rice University have made a prototype of just such a camera.

16546	NYT_ENG_20070312.0107.LDC2009T13	Tao's best known mathematical work involves prime numbers -- positive whole numbers that can be divided evenly only by themselves and 1.
16547	NYT_ENG_20070312.0107.LDC2009T13	The first few prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11 and 13 (1 is excluded).
16548	NYT_ENG_20070312.0107.LDC2009T13	As numbers get larger, prime numbers become sparser, but the Greek mathematician Euclid proved sometime around 300 B.C. that there is nonetheless an infinite number of primes.
16549	NYT_ENG_20070312.0107.LDC2009T13	Many questions about prime numbers continue to elude answers.
16550	NYT_ENG_20070312.0107.LDC2009T13	Euclid also believed that there was an infinite number of "twin primes" -- pairs of prime numbers separated by 2, like 3 and 5 or 11 and 13 -- but he was unable to prove his conjecture.
16551	NYT_ENG_20070312.0107.LDC2009T13	Nor has anyone else in the succeeding 2,300 years.
16552	NYT_ENG_20070312.0107.LDC2009T13	A larger unknown question is whether hidden patterns exist in the sequence of prime numbers or whether they appear randomly.
16553	NYT_ENG_20070312.0107.LDC2009T13	In 2004, Tao, along with Ben Green, a mathematician now at the University of Cambridge in England, solved a problem related to the Twin Prime Conjecture by looking at prime number progressions -- series of numbers equally spaced.
16554	NYT_ENG_20070312.0107.LDC2009T13	(For example, 3, 7 and 11 constitute a progression of prime numbers with a spacing of 4
16555	NYT_ENG_20070312.0107.LDC2009T13	the next number in the sequence, 15, is not prime.)
16556	NYT_ENG_20070312.0107.LDC2009T13	Tao and Green proved that it is always possible to find, somewhere in the infinity of integers, a progression of prime numbers of any spacing and any length.
16557	NYT_ENG_20070312.0107.LDC2009T13	"Terry has a style that very few have," Fefferman said.
16558	NYT_ENG_20070312.0107.LDC2009T13	"When he solves the problem, you think to yourself, 'This is so obvious and why didn't I see it?
16559	NYT_ENG_20070312.0107.LDC2009T13	Why didn't the 100 distinguished people who thought about this before not think of it?"'
16560	NYT_ENG_20070312.0107.LDC2009T13	Tao's proficiency with numbers appeared at a very young age.
16561	NYT_ENG_20070312.0107.LDC2009T13	"I always liked numbers," he said.
16562	NYT_ENG_20070312.0107.LDC2009T13	A 2-year-old Terry Tao used toy blocks to show older children how to count.
16563	NYT_ENG_20070312.0107.LDC2009T13	He was quick with language and used the blocks to spell words like "dog" and "cat."
16564	NYT_ENG_20070312.0107.LDC2009T13	"He probably was quietly learning these things from watching 'Sesame Street,"' said his father, Billy Tao, a pediatrician who immigrated to Australia from Hong Kong in 1972.
16565	NYT_ENG_20070312.0107.LDC2009T13	"We basically used 'Sesame Street' as a babysitter."
16566	NYT_ENG_20070312.0107.LDC2009T13	The blocks had been bought as toys, not learning tools.
16567	NYT_ENG_20070312.0107.LDC2009T13	"You expect them to throw them around," said Billy Tao.
16568	NYT_ENG_20070312.0107.LDC2009T13	Terry's parents placed him in a private school when he was 3 1/2.
16569	NYT_ENG_20070312.0107.LDC2009T13	They pulled him out six weeks later because he was not ready to spend that much time in a classroom, and the teacher was not ready to teach someone like him.
16570	NYT_ENG_20070312.0107.LDC2009T13	At age 5, he was enrolled in a public school, and his parents, administrators and teachers set up an individualized program for him.
16571	NYT_ENG_20070312.0107.LDC2009T13	He proceeded through each subject at his own pace, quickly accelerating through several grades in math and science while remaining closer to his age group in other subjects.
16572	NYT_ENG_20070312.0107.LDC2009T13	In English classes, for instance, he became flustered when he had to write essays.
16573	NYT_ENG_20070312.0107.LDC2009T13	"I never really got the hang of that," he said.
16574	NYT_ENG_20070312.0107.LDC2009T13	"These very vague, undefined questions.
16575	NYT_ENG_20070312.0107.LDC2009T13	I always liked situations where there were very clear rules of what to do."
16576	NYT_ENG_20070312.0107.LDC2009T13	Assigned to write a story about what was going on at home, Terry went from room to room and made detailed lists of the contents.

16594	NYT_ENG_20070312.0107.LDC2009T13	He completed a Ph.D. in mathematics and now works for the Defense Science and Technology Organization in Australia.

16600	NYT_ENG_20070312.0107.LDC2009T13	Terry completed his undergraduate degree in two years, earned a master's degree a year after that, then moved to Princeton for his doctoral studies.
16601	NYT_ENG_20070312.0107.LDC2009T13	While he said he never felt out of place in a class of much older students, Princeton was where he finally felt he fit among a group of peers.
16602	NYT_ENG_20070312.0107.LDC2009T13	He was still younger, but was not necessarily the brightest student all the time.
16603	NYT_ENG_20070312.0107.LDC2009T13	His attitude toward math also matured.
16604	NYT_ENG_20070312.0107.LDC2009T13	Until then, math had been competitions, problem sets, exams.

16606	NYT_ENG_20070312.0107.LDC2009T13	Tao recalled that as a child, "I remember having this vague idea that what mathematicians did was that, some authority, someone gave them problems to solve and they just sort of solved them."

16624	NYT_ENG_20070322.0185.LDC2009T13	She was a one-woman sales force, and her store was a diaper bag, from which she sold BabyLegs anywhere moms congregated: playgrounds, coffee shops, consignment stores.
16625	NYT_ENG_20070322.0185.LDC2009T13	"If they like something, they'll tell all the other moms about it," Donnelly said.
16626	NYT_ENG_20070322.0185.LDC2009T13	"Women are social, and that has really benefited our business."
16627	NYT_ENG_20070322.0185.LDC2009T13	Before long, Donnelly had a factory supplier in China and moved from the kitchen of her two-bedroom apartment into a 3,500 -square-foot office and warehouse in South Seattle.
16628	NYT_ENG_20070322.0185.LDC2009T13	Now babies and children all around the world sport BabyLegs
16629	NYT_ENG_20070322.0185.LDC2009T13	Donnelly sells several thousand $12 pairs every day.
16630	NYT_ENG_20070322.0185.LDC2009T13	The inspirations for "mamapreneurs" like Donnelly to start a business are many, but often they see an unmet need and fill it.
16631	NYT_ENG_20070322.0185.LDC2009T13	In Seattle, newish moms are behind the hip baby-gear store, Tottini, in South Lake Union, as well as the local online resource, Red Tricycle, and the organic baby food delivery service, Sprouts.
16632	NYT_ENG_20070322.0185.LDC2009T13	While many a new mom struggles to meet all of the demands in her life and feels that some days a mere shower is a luxury, another breed decides that, between feedings, changings and naps, it's time to start a business.
16633	NYT_ENG_20070322.0185.LDC2009T13	So they become a mamapreneur, blending parenthood with entrepreneurship, usually by creating a baby- or child-centric business or product.
16634	NYT_ENG_20070322.0185.LDC2009T13	The phenomenon is exploding all over the country, coinciding with a demand for stylish children's gear and a wave of older first-time parents who have more disposable income to spend on their kids.
16635	NYT_ENG_20070322.0185.LDC2009T13	Many a mamapreneur has never owned or run a business before, but applies her former job skills while learning the rest on the job.
16636	NYT_ENG_20070322.0185.LDC2009T13	They often rely on word of mouth through the mama grapevine to get exposure.
16637	NYT_ENG_20070322.0185.LDC2009T13	No one knows the number of mamapreneurs out there, but one-woman businesses -- which many moms fall into -- grew at twice the rate of all other businesses between 1997 and 2004, according to the Center for Women's Business Research.
16638	NYT_ENG_20070322.0185.LDC2009T13	Victoria Colligan says that about half of the 30,000 subscribers to Ladies Who Launch, an online network for entrepreneurs that she co-founded, are mothers with young children.
16639	NYT_ENG_20070322.0185.LDC2009T13	"We see a lot of women realizing when they have a baby that they don't want the corporate lifestyle they had previously, yet they want to be inspired and make money and do something," said Colligan, who has two young children.
16640	NYT_ENG_20070322.0185.LDC2009T13	"A lot of businesses are born during naptime."
16641	NYT_ENG_20070322.0185.LDC2009T13	She said the No. 1 reason women start businesses is for flexibility and control, followed by passion and money.
16642	NYT_ENG_20070322.0185.LDC2009T13	But they tend to launch differently from men, she added, starting lower-risk businesses with small amounts of capital and lighter overhead.
16643	NYT_ENG_20070322.0185.LDC2009T13	That was true for Donnelly, who incorporated in the summer of 2005 with $8,000 borrowed from her mother and relatives.
16644	NYT_ENG_20070322.0185.LDC2009T13	She now has 16 employees
16645	NYT_ENG_20070322.0185.LDC2009T13	about 60 e-tailers and 740 stores sell BabyLegs.
16646	NYT_ENG_20070322.0185.LDC2009T13	Cause Haun started See Kai Run as a sideline while she worked at an education foundation.
16647	NYT_ENG_20070322.0185.LDC2009T13	When her son, Kai, then a year old, was given baby shoes with super-flexible rubber soles during a family trip to China, Haun brought some samples home and showed them to a few Seattle stores.
16648	NYT_ENG_20070322.0185.LDC2009T13	"It was just a fun idea to make a little money," said Haun, who has a degree in international business.
16649	NYT_ENG_20070322.0185.LDC2009T13	"But the reaction was so strong that we got excited."
16650	NYT_ENG_20070322.0185.LDC2009T13	So she and her husband, Gang Chen, found a small manufacturer with a modest order requirement to keep the initial investment and risk low.
16651	NYT_ENG_20070322.0185.LDC2009T13	The business started in late 2004 and experienced 400 percent growth in a year.
16652	NYT_ENG_20070322.0185.LDC2009T13	See Kai Run shoes were first sold in Seattle, and are now sold by 800 retailers across the country.
16653	NYT_ENG_20070322.0185.LDC2009T13	At first, the couple ran the company out of their Rainier Beach home, but they now have a Woodinville office and six employees, as well as a second son.
16654	NYT_ENG_20070322.0185.LDC2009T13	"It's a business that you feel is very integrated into your family, so there isn't a disconnect," said Haun, 36.
16655	NYT_ENG_20070322.0185.LDC2009T13	"I mean, Kai would run to meet the UPS man when we got home."
16656	NYT_ENG_20070322.0185.LDC2009T13	Many mama-run businesses are smaller and run entirely out of the home, where there might be crying, babbling or happy shrieks in the background.
16657	NYT_ENG_20070322.0185.LDC2009T13	Running a child-focused company gives moms a world outside of, but still connected to, mashed peas and play dates.
16658	NYT_ENG_20070322.0185.LDC2009T13	Meredith Stinson had tried several of the seemingly infinite number of baby carriers available, but couldn't find one in a print she liked.
16659	NYT_ENG_20070322.0185.LDC2009T13	So her friend Crystal Hamilton, a new mom as well as a designer and seamstress, said, "Let's make one."
16660	NYT_ENG_20070322.0185.LDC2009T13	"We were just going to do a small hobby for friends and baby showers, and before we knew it we had five seamstresses working for us," Stinson said.
16661	NYT_ENG_20070322.0185.LDC2009T13	A few well-placed mentions, including one in The Wall Street Journal, increased orders from a few a week to several hundred.
16662	NYT_ENG_20070322.0185.LDC2009T13	But there were long hours and lots to learn, such as finding a source for wholesale fabric.
16663	NYT_ENG_20070322.0185.LDC2009T13	"Sometimes we were like, 'What were we thinking?'
16664	NYT_ENG_20070322.0185.LDC2009T13	We were so na?ve," Stinson said.
16665	NYT_ENG_20070322.0185.LDC2009T13	The business didn't make money for the first two years and Stinson and Hamilton now take home less money than they did in previous jobs.
16666	NYT_ENG_20070322.0185.LDC2009T13	Stinson also said she misses having co-workers in the next cubicle, but her satisfaction is greater.
16667	NYT_ENG_20070322.0185.LDC2009T13	"I'm doing things I never thought I'd be doing before.
16668	NYT_ENG_20070322.0185.LDC2009T13	I never thought I'd be talking to trademark lawyers.
16669	NYT_ENG_20070322.0185.LDC2009T13	I never thought I'd be talking to women in Switzerland about what patterns work best for them," said Stinson, a former event planner and concert manager.
16670	NYT_ENG_20070322.0185.LDC2009T13	Gina Hadley, a former New York advertising executive, had an idea for a play space for kids that integrated adults and didn't feel too kiddie.
16671	NYT_ENG_20070322.0185.LDC2009T13	At a dinner party she met Jeanna Peterson, a Microsoft product manager, and the two talked about how great such a place would be.
16672	NYT_ENG_20070322.0185.LDC2009T13	Peterson quit her job and she and Hadley started Urban Monkeys, an 8,800-square-foot family center in South Lake Union with classes -- for kids and adults -- in things like creative dance, yoga and nutrition.
16673	NYT_ENG_20070322.0185.LDC2009T13	They also offer baby-sitting and massage therapy.
16674	NYT_ENG_20070322.0185.LDC2009T13	"Nobody was speaking to this urban constituency," Hadley said, "especially women who are or were urban professionals."
16675	NYT_ENG_20070322.0185.LDC2009T13	Urban Monkeys has about 225 families enrolled and the founders are looking into licensing the idea.
16676	NYT_ENG_20070322.0185.LDC2009T13	Nyro Murphy was simply looking to get out of the house when she went to a new moms' group, but she began chatting with another mom, Kelly Buck, about a lack of chic maternity wear in town.
16677	NYT_ENG_20070322.0185.LDC2009T13	So they opened Bump, a Roosevelt area boutique for hip mothers-to- be.
16678	NYT_ENG_20070322.0185.LDC2009T13	Now, each works three days a week and they share a nanny.
16679	NYT_ENG_20070322.0185.LDC2009T13	"We fantasized about having our children at the store, but while you're trying to help some woman try on 10 different outfits, you have a crying baby," said Murphy, a former counselor.
16680	NYT_ENG_20070322.0185.LDC2009T13	"It just doesn't work."
16681	NYT_ENG_20070322.0185.LDC2009T13	Buck, a former attorney, also owns Pop Tots, a store with vintage and unusual kids' clothing.
16682	NYT_ENG_20070322.0185.LDC2009T13	"I'm a better mother, I think, to have something of my own," said Buck, who is pregnant with her second child.
16683	NYT_ENG_20070322.0185.LDC2009T13	Mamapreneurs are good at spreading the love.
16684	NYT_ENG_20070322.0185.LDC2009T13	Bump sells the wares of other local moms, including the All Weather Woobee, a plush blanket with a water-resistant side.
16685	NYT_ENG_20070322.0185.LDC2009T13	Its creator, Heather Correa, in turn, hired another mom with young kids to design and maintain her Web site, and a friend of hers who's a new mom did the photography.
16686	NYT_ENG_20070322.0185.LDC2009T13	She also has the Woobee made in Seattle.
16687	NYT_ENG_20070322.0185.LDC2009T13	Correa seeded her small business with tip money from waiting tables at Ray's Boathouse.
16688	NYT_ENG_20070322.0185.LDC2009T13	Giving the blanket to celebrities, including Angela Bassett and Tia Carrere at a recent pre-Golden Globes event, helped create buzz.
16689	NYT_ENG_20070322.0185.LDC2009T13	Correa still waits tables as her husband transitions to a new career, and she's sometimes exhausted from her multiple roles.

16691	NYT_ENG_20070322.0185.LDC2009T13	I think there's special institutions for mothers who take this on," said Correa, who has lots of energy supplemented by caffeine.
16692	NYT_ENG_20070322.0185.LDC2009T13	"Part of it was ignorance.

16694	NYT_ENG_20070322.0185.LDC2009T13	But it's rewarding, and she hopes to share the company with her two daughters one day, whether through money for a college fund, or teaching them about business.

16696	NYT_ENG_20070328.0258.LDC2009T13	WASHINGTON
16697	NYT_ENG_20070328.0258.LDC2009T13	With both houses of Congress now firmly on record in favor of withdrawing from Iraq, President Bush vowed Wednesday not to negotiate a timetable with Democrats, and a confrontation appeared inevitable as each side prepared to blame the other for delays in providing money for the war.
16698	NYT_ENG_20070328.0258.LDC2009T13	"Now, some of them believe that by delaying funding for our troops, they can force me to accept restrictions on our commanders that I believe would make withdrawal and defeat more likely," Bush told an audience of cattlemen and ranchers.
16699	NYT_ENG_20070328.0258.LDC2009T13	"That's not going to happen.
16700	NYT_ENG_20070328.0258.LDC2009T13	If Congress fails to pass a bill to fund our troops on the front lines, the American people will know who to hold responsible."
16701	NYT_ENG_20070328.0258.LDC2009T13	Bush and congressional Democrats are already deadlocked over the Democrats' demands for testimony from top White House officials in an inquiry into the firing of federal prosecutors.
16702	NYT_ENG_20070328.0258.LDC2009T13	The president's remarks on Wednesday, a day after the Senate voted for the first time in favor of setting a withdrawal date, set the stage for a second clash.
16703	NYT_ENG_20070328.0258.LDC2009T13	That puts Bush in the difficult position of fighting the new Democratic majority on two fronts, both the war spending and the prosecutors.
16704	NYT_ENG_20070328.0258.LDC2009T13	On Wednesday, he seemed in no mood to back down from the war spending fight.
16705	NYT_ENG_20070328.0258.LDC2009T13	As he quoted a newspaper editorial -- from The Los Angeles Times, though he did not mention it by name -- accusing Democrats of "the worst kind of congressional meddling in military strategy," Bush appeared almost eager for a battle.
16706	NYT_ENG_20070328.0258.LDC2009T13	And Democrats seemed eager to give it to him.
16707	NYT_ENG_20070328.0258.LDC2009T13	Rep. Nancy Pelosi of California, the House speaker, said Bush should "calm down with the threats," and Sen. Harry Reid of Nevada, the Democratic leader, said his impression was that Bush "doesn't want anything other than a confrontation."
16708	NYT_ENG_20070328.0258.LDC2009T13	The House approved its version of the spending bill last week, and the Senate was expected to approve its version on Thursday.
16709	NYT_ENG_20070328.0258.LDC2009T13	Democrats said they were ready to begin House-Senate negotiations quickly to produce a final version to send to the president.
16710	NYT_ENG_20070328.0258.LDC2009T13	The Democratic leaders, Pelosi and Reid, tried to strike a conciliatory tone, stressing they will deliver all the money Bush requested.
16711	NYT_ENG_20070328.0258.LDC2009T13	In a joint letter to the president, they said they stood ready to work with the White House, "But your threats to veto a bill that has not even been presented to you indicate that you may not be ready to work with us."

16715	NYT_ENG_20070329.0287.LDC2009T13	Coach John Thompson III and his assistants have led a swift and stunning revival of the program in just three seasons, a timetable so short that even Thompson said it exceeded his expectations.
16716	NYT_ENG_20070329.0287.LDC2009T13	And while he has been showered with praise for restoring the program's glory, one of his assistant coaches, Kevin Broadus, is also reaping the rewards.
16717	NYT_ENG_20070329.0287.LDC2009T13	He was named the head coach at Binghamton University on Monday.
16718	NYT_ENG_20070329.0287.LDC2009T13	What Binghamton officials did not know, and what few have talked about amid this feel-good week here, is that Thompson and Broadus recruited a player to Georgetown who in four years of public high school in Delaware compiled final grades of F in 12 courses.
16719	NYT_ENG_20070329.0287.LDC2009T13	That player was Marc Egerson, who had a grade-point average of 1.33 in core courses like math, science and English.
16720	NYT_ENG_20070329.0287.LDC2009T13	After redeeming his academic standing at Lutheran Christian Academy, a prep school in Philadelphia, Egerson took his stellar on-court credentials as a two-time state basketball player of the year to Georgetown.
16721	NYT_ENG_20070329.0287.LDC2009T13	The Hoyas will compete this weekend in Atlanta for a shot at the national championship.
16722	NYT_ENG_20070329.0287.LDC2009T13	Broadus, meanwhile, will be on the Georgetown bench before heading to his $205,000-a-year job at Binghamton.
16723	NYT_ENG_20070329.0287.LDC2009T13	Egerson left the Hoyas in January for personal reasons after playing in 13 games.
16724	NYT_ENG_20070329.0287.LDC2009T13	He has since transferred to the University of Delaware.
16725	NYT_ENG_20070329.0287.LDC2009T13	On Tuesday, Thompson avoided one question about Egerson, then brushed off a follow-up query by saying: "You move on.
16726	NYT_ENG_20070329.0287.LDC2009T13	He's going to be extremely successful where he is right now."
16727	NYT_ENG_20070329.0287.LDC2009T13	(Egerson was on spring break and could not be reached for comment.)
16728	NYT_ENG_20070329.0287.LDC2009T13	Binghamton Athletic Director Joel Thirer said in a telephone interview on Wednesday that Binghamton, which competes in Division I in the America East Conference, has high admissions standards for its student body and athletes.
16729	NYT_ENG_20070329.0287.LDC2009T13	That, he said, is what attracted him to a coach from Georgetown.
16730	NYT_ENG_20070329.0287.LDC2009T13	Thirer said he worked hard to learn about Broadus, but had no idea of Broadus' recruitment of Egerson and other athletes from Lutheran.
16731	NYT_ENG_20070329.0287.LDC2009T13	"We legitimately did our homework," he said, adding that Broadus had received "glowing references."
16732	NYT_ENG_20070329.0287.LDC2009T13	But when told of the contents of Egerson's transcript, Thirer said: "Georgetown University accepted a kid like that?
16733	NYT_ENG_20070329.0287.LDC2009T13	Wow."
16734	NYT_ENG_20070329.0287.LDC2009T13	A group of senior Georgetown officials carefully reviewed the circumstances surrounding Egerson's admission last year, according to John J. DeGioia, the university's president.
16735	NYT_ENG_20070329.0287.LDC2009T13	He also praised the Hoyas' basketball recruiting effort under Thompson.
16736	NYT_ENG_20070329.0287.LDC2009T13	"I think if you look at the whole picture, and you look at the folks that John has brought in, I think you will find a deep resonance with the tradition and the standards and the character of the program," DeGioia said.
16737	NYT_ENG_20070402.0047.LDC2009T13	RAYS NEED TO FIND PROGRESS BEYOND WINS
16738	NYT_ENG_20070402.0047.LDC2009T13	NEW YORK Baseball success is usually measured in numbers.
16739	NYT_ENG_20070402.0047.LDC2009T13	As the Yankees run onto the field for this afternoon's season opener, they'll have the usual, legitimate expectations of 90-100 wins and the seasonlong competition for a playoff spot that comes with them.
16740	NYT_ENG_20070402.0047.LDC2009T13	Though the Devil Rays will be just across the diamond, they really couldn't be any further apart.
16741	NYT_ENG_20070402.0047.LDC2009T13	And that's besides the $186-million to $23-million chasm in payroll.
16742	NYT_ENG_20070402.0047.LDC2009T13	The Rays are beginning another season, their 10th, as not-ready- for-first-place players, and their goals are understandably more meager.
16743	NYT_ENG_20070402.0047.LDC2009T13	Success for the Rays might be a .500 record with the 81 wins 11 more than they've ever achieved, and 20 more than last year.
16744	NYT_ENG_20070402.0047.LDC2009T13	It could be something hard to quantify, such as enough improvement by enough players in enough areas so that next season they can be good enough to compete.
16745	NYT_ENG_20070402.0047.LDC2009T13	Or something intangible, such as manager Joe Maddon's quest to improve the culture.
16746	NYT_ENG_20070402.0047.LDC2009T13	It could be something general, such as playing the game the right way.
16747	NYT_ENG_20070402.0047.LDC2009T13	Or it could be a little more specific, such as principal owner Stuart Sternberg's stated goal and admitted "bugaboo" to expand their homefield advantage at Tropicana Field and win 50 of 81 (actually 78 as three in May are being moved to the Disney complex), with the assumption they can win more on the road than the 20 they did last season.
16748	NYT_ENG_20070402.0047.LDC2009T13	For the Rays, the expectations and the measurements are different.
16749	NYT_ENG_20070402.0047.LDC2009T13	We asked a number of key team personnel to define what would make this season a success.
16750	NYT_ENG_20070402.0047.LDC2009T13	Carl Crawford, star leftfielder
16751	NYT_ENG_20070402.0047.LDC2009T13	"Me personally, I'd just like to see us have like a .500 record, or better.
16752	NYT_ENG_20070402.0047.LDC2009T13	Development of some of the players to take another step closer to where we're trying to get as we become an all- around better team.
16753	NYT_ENG_20070402.0047.LDC2009T13	Realistically, I'd like to play .500 ball once.
16754	NYT_ENG_20070402.0047.LDC2009T13	We can't say we're going to do something when we never even ever in our history played .500 ball.
16755	NYT_ENG_20070402.0047.LDC2009T13	If we can do that first, that would be a big step for us.
16756	NYT_ENG_20070402.0047.LDC2009T13	Play .500 ball this year
16757	NYT_ENG_20070402.0047.LDC2009T13	next year, build on that and keep building."

16763	NYT_ENG_20070402.0047.LDC2009T13	We want our metrics to rise.

16766	NYT_ENG_20070402.0047.LDC2009T13	"I'd take .500.
16767	NYT_ENG_20070402.0047.LDC2009T13	You have to start somewhere.
16768	NYT_ENG_20070402.0047.LDC2009T13	Have we ever had a .500 season with this organization?
16769	NYT_ENG_20070402.0047.LDC2009T13	We have to change that around a little bit.
16770	NYT_ENG_20070402.0047.LDC2009T13	We can't accept that anymore.
16771	NYT_ENG_20070402.0047.LDC2009T13	We can't accept being 'not last place.'
16772	NYT_ENG_20070402.0047.LDC2009T13	That attitude, everything like that, has got to stop if we want to actually start winning.
16773	NYT_ENG_20070402.0047.LDC2009T13	You can't just coast in there with a 'we never had a shot' type attitude.
16774	NYT_ENG_20070402.0047.LDC2009T13	You have to go out there and compete just like everyone else.
16775	NYT_ENG_20070402.0047.LDC2009T13	Everyone has already seen we can beat the best in the league, we just have to do it on a consistent basis.
16776	NYT_ENG_20070402.0047.LDC2009T13	We can do that.
16777	NYT_ENG_20070402.0047.LDC2009T13	Everything we do, we have to shoot high."
16778	NYT_ENG_20070402.0047.LDC2009T13	Joe Maddon, manager
16779	NYT_ENG_20070402.0047.LDC2009T13	"Unity.
16780	NYT_ENG_20070402.0047.LDC2009T13	Unity in the clubhouse and on the field, unity in the entire organization is a success.

16782	NYT_ENG_20070402.0047.LDC2009T13	Developing the Ray Way so truly that going into next year, we know exactly what that means.
16783	NYT_ENG_20070402.0047.LDC2009T13	So that when other people walk in our front door they know this is the way we do things here.
16784	NYT_ENG_20070402.0047.LDC2009T13	Part of that is rebuilding the culture.
16785	NYT_ENG_20070402.0047.LDC2009T13	I want our guys to be proud of wearing this uniform and conduct themselves appropriately on and off the field.

16788	NYT_ENG_20070402.0047.LDC2009T13	If we're supposed to win 80, 85, 90, whatever that might be, that gives us the best chance of doing that.

16824	NYT_ENG_20070408.0021.LDC2009T13	Being a foster parent was one thing, but before taking in developmentally disabled children, Ken Rowin had to pray for strength.
16825	NYT_ENG_20070408.0021.LDC2009T13	This was not just feeling sorry for the children or occasionally caring for them.
16826	NYT_ENG_20070408.0021.LDC2009T13	This was diving into their lives, showing them love at their most difficult times.
16827	NYT_ENG_20070408.0021.LDC2009T13	A counselor advised Rowin and his wife to visit with another family who took care of developmentally disabled children, just to get a taste of what their lives would become.
16828	NYT_ENG_20070408.0021.LDC2009T13	After the visit, one of Rowin's adopted kids asked him why they had visited with the children in wheelchairs.
16829	NYT_ENG_20070408.0021.LDC2009T13	"I said, 'God wants us to love these children for him because nobody else wants to,"' Rowin said.

16836	NYT_ENG_20070411.0190.LDC2009T13	Cox News Service
16837	NYT_ENG_20070411.0190.LDC2009T13	ATLANTA -- A proposal to hang a portrait of Coretta Scott King in the state Capitol died in a legislative committee Wednesday, prompting a racially charged rebuke from the measure's sponsor.
16838	NYT_ENG_20070411.0190.LDC2009T13	House Special Rules Committee members said they rejected the measure because they believe King has already been sufficiently recognized and the Capitol should be reserved for Georgia lawmakers.
16839	NYT_ENG_20070411.0190.LDC2009T13	Rep. Roberta Abdul-Salaam (D-Riverdale), who sponsored the resolution, lashed out at the committee, saying its action was worse than radio shock jock Don Imus calling the Rutgers University women's basketball team "nappy-headed hos."
16840	NYT_ENG_20070411.0190.LDC2009T13	"It is just like calling Mrs. King a nappy-headed (N-word)," Abdul-Salaam told reporters after the committee rejected House Resolution 376, killing it for this legislative session.
16841	NYT_ENG_20070411.0190.LDC2009T13	"There is already talk about boycotting in this country.
16842	NYT_ENG_20070411.0190.LDC2009T13	We just need to really expand it to Georgia, if necessary," she said.
16843	NYT_ENG_20070411.0190.LDC2009T13	"It is absolutely time to realize that you cannot continue to conduct yourselves in such a manner and think that there will be no repercussions."
16844	NYT_ENG_20070411.0190.LDC2009T13	Committee chairman Calvin Hill (R-Canton) said race had nothing to do with his panel's decision, calling King a "wonderful humanitarian."
16845	NYT_ENG_20070411.0190.LDC2009T13	"It is an emotional overreaction," Hill said of Abdul-Salaam's comments.
16846	NYT_ENG_20070411.0190.LDC2009T13	"She may be under the misunderstanding that this is a museum at the Capitol.
16847	NYT_ENG_20070411.0190.LDC2009T13	It is not a museum."
16848	NYT_ENG_20070411.0190.LDC2009T13	After Abdul-Salaam presented her proposal to the committee, Rep. Doug Holt (R-Social Circle) motioned for the panel to pass the resolution.
16849	NYT_ENG_20070411.0190.LDC2009T13	But no one on the three-member committee seconded the motion, so the resolution died.
16850	NYT_ENG_20070411.0190.LDC2009T13	"I think that Coretta Scott King has been remembered sufficiently..." committee member Mike Keown (R-Coolidge) said in an interview after the meeting.
16851	NYT_ENG_20070411.0190.LDC2009T13	"I think the King Center is going to stand forever.
16852	NYT_ENG_20070411.0190.LDC2009T13	And it will always be a monument to the legacy of the Kings.
16853	NYT_ENG_20070411.0190.LDC2009T13	And, respectfully, I think that more than anything, Coretta Scott King is going to be remembered as the wife of Martin Luther King Jr."

16879	NYT_ENG_20070413.0234.LDC2009T13	WASHINGTON
16880	NYT_ENG_20070413.0234.LDC2009T13	Paul D. Wolfowitz, the embattled president of the World Bank, worked behind the scenes on Friday to gain the support of finance and development ministers from around the world, but there were few endorsements of his leadership outside the Bush administration.
16881	NYT_ENG_20070413.0234.LDC2009T13	"We must just allow the process to work through," said Trevor Manuel, the finance minister of South Africa, referring to the bank board's announcement on Friday that it would continue to weigh Wolfowitz's role in the transfer and pay raise of his companion after he became president of the bank in 2005.
16882	NYT_ENG_20070413.0234.LDC2009T13	Manuel also said the bank must avoid a rush to judgment.
16883	NYT_ENG_20070413.0234.LDC2009T13	But Manuel is close to Wolfowitz, and the failure to praise him was significant.
16884	NYT_ENG_20070413.0234.LDC2009T13	Wolfowitz visited South Africa this year and has called Manuel one of Africa's most talented leaders.
16885	NYT_ENG_20070413.0234.LDC2009T13	In Paris, a Foreign Ministry spokesman was similarly tepid and noncommittal, noting that the bank's board had a process under way.
16886	NYT_ENG_20070413.0234.LDC2009T13	He said France would make its own views known when appropriate.
16887	NYT_ENG_20070413.0234.LDC2009T13	Throughout the day, Bush administration officials praised Wolfowitz's leadership, but at an evening news conference, Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. said that because the bank board was still considering the matter, he would not comment on what he thought the outcome should be.
16888	NYT_ENG_20070413.0234.LDC2009T13	"This should not be read as any lessening of the United States' support for Paul Wolfowitz," he said.
16889	NYT_ENG_20070413.0234.LDC2009T13	Asked specifically if he would call for Wolfowitz to remain as head of the World Bank, he responded, "I said what I said."
16890	NYT_ENG_20070413.0234.LDC2009T13	The disclosure on Thursday of Wolfowitz's involvement in the raise given to his companion, Shaha Ali Riza, has stirred a furor within the bank and prompted demands from its staff association that he step down.
16891	NYT_ENG_20070413.0234.LDC2009T13	Board members are said to be considering whether to reprimand him or encourage him to resign.
16892	NYT_ENG_20070413.0234.LDC2009T13	Bank officials familiar with the thinking of some of the 24 members of the board, who represent countries or groups of countries, said they were uncertain how to proceed and would be consulting this weekend with finance ministers here for meetings of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.
16893	NYT_ENG_20070413.0234.LDC2009T13	The bank leadership was also looking for a signal from the United States, including an indication as to whether President Bush would insist that Wolfowitz had done nothing wrong, or whether some in the administration might encourage him to resign from an institution that is in a virtual uprising against his leadership.
16894	NYT_ENG_20070413.0234.LDC2009T13	"He could decide that his relationship with the staff and the board is so soured that he doesn't have the trust he needs to go forward," one administration official said, adding that he saw no evidence the White House was pushing for that.
16895	NYT_ENG_20070413.0234.LDC2009T13	Early Friday morning, after meeting the previous evening, the bank's board released a sheaf of documents about Wolfowitz's decision to direct the bank's vice president for human resources to reassign Riza to the State Department with a promotion, a raise and guarantees of future raises and promotions.
16896	NYT_ENG_20070413.0234.LDC2009T13	The staff association has charged that several of Wolfowitz's actions violated normal bank rules.
16897	NYT_ENG_20070413.0234.LDC2009T13	The board issued a statement saying that Wolfowitz did not involve the ethics and legal counsel in many of the decisions relating to the transfer, contrary to earlier suggestions by Wolfowitz.
16898	NYT_ENG_20070413.0234.LDC2009T13	But it did not conclude that he had deliberately flouted the rules.
16899	NYT_ENG_20070413.0234.LDC2009T13	The 7,000 employees of the World Bank in Washington have been exchanging e-mail messages and comments, many of them critical of Wolfowitz but some expressing sympathy with his situation and his dealings with Riza, who had been a bank officer for seven years when he became president in 2005.
16900	NYT_ENG_20070413.0234.LDC2009T13	Supporters and critics of Wolfowitz seized on the documents as evidence for the two different points of view.
16901	NYT_ENG_20070413.0234.LDC2009T13	On one hand, the documents made it clear that Wolfowitz was very much involved in the decision to give Riza a raise to more than $190,000 a year, with the aim of compensating her for the disruption of the transfer, but critics said he violated his own preaching to the bank about the need for transparency and integrity.
16902	NYT_ENG_20070413.0234.LDC2009T13	On the other hand, Wolfowitz's defenders noted that the documents showed he had tried to recuse himself from involvement in personnel decisions affecting Riza when he arrived at the bank, and reluctantly became involved in her transfer only after the head of ethics for the board directed him to do so.
16903	NYT_ENG_20070413.0234.LDC2009T13	Wolfowitz remained out of public view on Friday, as did Riza, a British citizen who was born in Libya.
16904	NYT_ENG_20070413.0234.LDC2009T13	But the board's documents provided a glimpse into the emotions of both as they struggled to reconcile their professional and personal lives.
16905	NYT_ENG_20070413.0234.LDC2009T13	In his first month at the bank, Wolfowitz appeared from the documents to have been almost preoccupied by the matter.
16906	NYT_ENG_20070413.0234.LDC2009T13	He had at first tried to allow Riza to stay at the bank and even to deal with her professionally there, with the promise to recuse himself if conflicts arose.
16907	NYT_ENG_20070413.0234.LDC2009T13	That wish was denied by the ethics staff.
16908	NYT_ENG_20070413.0234.LDC2009T13	With some irritation, Wolfowitz wrote a note in August 2005 saying the ethics committee had "explicitly directed me to resolve the matter by providing instruction" to a vice president for human resources.
16909	NYT_ENG_20070413.0234.LDC2009T13	Later, he sent that vice president a directive that Riza be given promotions and pay raises.
16910	NYT_ENG_20070413.0234.LDC2009T13	The documents show that the officials involved in making arrangements for the transfer to the State Department included J. Scott Carpenter, a deputy assistant secretary of state.
16911	NYT_ENG_20070413.0234.LDC2009T13	Riza displayed even more displeasure in a letter written to the board this month from her position as an adviser to a semi- independent foundation that promotes democracy.
16912	NYT_ENG_20070413.0234.LDC2009T13	She said she felt "victimized for agreeing to an arrangement that I have objected to, and that I did not believe from the outset was in my best interest."

16914	NYT_ENG_20070414.0078.LDC2009T13	MOSCOW
16915	NYT_ENG_20070414.0078.LDC2009T13	Garry Kasparov, the former chess champion turned opposition politician in Russia, was arrested with nearly 200 other protesters during a rally in Moscow on Saturday that ended in clashes with riot troops.
16916	NYT_ENG_20070414.0078.LDC2009T13	The rally, the third so-called Dissenters' March held by a loose anti-government coalition known as Other Russia, was noteworthy because authorities aggressively pursued the organizers, including President Vladimir V. Putin's' former prime minister, Mikhail M. Kasyanov, whom the police jostled but did not arrest.
16917	NYT_ENG_20070414.0078.LDC2009T13	The rally was principally supported by Kasyanov and Kasparov, who leads a group here called the United Civil Front.
16918	NYT_ENG_20070414.0078.LDC2009T13	Essentially barred from access to television, members of Other Russia have embraced street protests as the only platform to voice their opposition ahead of parliamentary elections in December and presidential elections next March.
16919	NYT_ENG_20070414.0078.LDC2009T13	Early this month, Kasyanov's and Kasparov's Web sites were blocked, though it was unclear by whom.
16920	NYT_ENG_20070414.0078.LDC2009T13	The marches have become a test both of the determination of the opposition and the willingness of the government to use force to prevent it from gaining traction in street politics in the big cities.
16921	NYT_ENG_20070414.0078.LDC2009T13	Other Russia was refused a permit to march in Moscow, but defied the ban, as it has in two previous marches in St. Petersburg and the Volga River city of Nizhny Novgorod.
16922	NYT_ENG_20070414.0078.LDC2009T13	Authorities said roughly 9,000 police and Interior Ministry troops, known as OMON, were deployed in Moscow on Saturday.
16923	NYT_ENG_20070414.0078.LDC2009T13	A Moscow police spokesman said 170 people were arrested
16924	NYT_ENG_20070414.0078.LDC2009T13	organizers said the number was much higher.
16925	NYT_ENG_20070414.0078.LDC2009T13	In addition to Kasparov, who was arrested while walking on Moscow's Tverskaya Street before arriving at the event, the police detained Maria Gaidar, a daughter of a former prime minister, and Ilya Yashin, the head of the youth wing of the Yabloko opposition party.
16926	NYT_ENG_20070414.0078.LDC2009T13	"I'm arrested," Kasparov, who has left professional chess but is still the world's highest-ranked player, said in a telephone interview from inside a detention van.
16927	NYT_ENG_20070414.0078.LDC2009T13	"It was an act of banditry."
16928	NYT_ENG_20070414.0078.LDC2009T13	There were reports that he was released, but by early evening, Kasparov was still in custody.
16929	NYT_ENG_20070414.0078.LDC2009T13	Kasyanov, the former prime minister, was surrounded by riot police as he approached the rally on foot.
16930	NYT_ENG_20070414.0078.LDC2009T13	"Everybody should ask themselves what is happening in our government," Kasyanov said, as the police closed in.
16931	NYT_ENG_20070414.0078.LDC2009T13	"We respect the constitution and demand the authorities do the same."
16932	NYT_ENG_20070414.0078.LDC2009T13	"Take them one by one," a police officer commanded over a bullhorn.
16933	NYT_ENG_20070414.0078.LDC2009T13	The police grabbed Kasyanov's bodyguards, arresting them, and Kasyanov tumbled backward but was caught by the crowd.
16934	NYT_ENG_20070414.0078.LDC2009T13	"Officers, don't fulfill illegal orders," Kasyanov shouted.

16938	NYT_ENG_20070424.0311.LDC2009T13	TALLAHASSEE A bill that would schedule Florida's presidential primary on Jan. 29 and require a paper trail in elections took on a life of its own Tuesday, prompting criticism from the League of Women Voters and Democratic senators.
16939	NYT_ENG_20070424.0311.LDC2009T13	After Republicans added amendments dealing with voter registration and record-keeping by election supervisors, Democrats voted no on a bill that includes one of their priorities: paper trails.
16940	NYT_ENG_20070424.0311.LDC2009T13	"We took a good cleanup of our elections system and turned it into a political bill," said Sen. Gwen Margolis, D-Sunny Isles.
16941	NYT_ENG_20070424.0311.LDC2009T13	The League of Women Voters, Common Cause and AFL-CIO all complained about an amendment that would reduce the fines for willful violations of a law by third-party groups that register voters, and would subject political parties to the same penalties.
16942	NYT_ENG_20070424.0311.LDC2009T13	"This makes it better than it is today," said Sen. Daniel Webster, R-Winter Garden.
16943	NYT_ENG_20070424.0311.LDC2009T13	The League of Women Voters successfully challenged a similar law in court, and the state is appealing.
16944	NYT_ENG_20070424.0311.LDC2009T13	The groups protested that the changes were being pushed through with so little debate.
16945	NYT_ENG_20070424.0311.LDC2009T13	"I can't understand why you are trying to make voter registration harder," said AFL-CIO president Cindy Hall.
16946	NYT_ENG_20070424.0311.LDC2009T13	The amended bill (SB 960-1010), which now heads to the full Senate for a vote, passed an appropriations committee on a 3-2 vote.
16947	NYT_ENG_20070424.0311.LDC2009T13	The panel's chairman, Sen. Mike Fasano, R-New Port Richey, voted yes.
16948	NYT_ENG_20070424.0311.LDC2009T13	The heart of the bill was barely discussed on Tuesday.
16949	NYT_ENG_20070424.0311.LDC2009T13	That includes advancing the 2008 presidential primary to Jan. 29 and using nearly $28-million in federal money to help 15 counties switch from touch screen machines to optical scan ballots with a verifiable paper trail.
16950	NYT_ENG_20070424.0311.LDC2009T13	The bill also allows minors to preregister to vote when they get a Florida driver's license, rather than when they turn 17.

16952	NYT_ENG_20070430.0220.LDC2009T13	FIVE BRITISH MUSLIMS GUILTY OF PLANNING BOMB ATTACKS
16953	NYT_ENG_20070430.0220.LDC2009T13	LONDON
16954	NYT_ENG_20070430.0220.LDC2009T13	A jury found five British Muslim men guilty on Monday of planning fertilizer-bomb attacks around London, ending a yearlong trial that linked the plotters with two of the four men who blew themselves up on London's transit system in July 2005.
16955	NYT_ENG_20070430.0220.LDC2009T13	According to the evidence, revealed during the trial but made public for the first time, authorities had closely monitored meetings in 2004 between members of the two plots but never fully investigated the men who pulled off the transit attacks, which killed 56 people 18 months later.
16956	NYT_ENG_20070430.0220.LDC2009T13	To ensure a fair trial, the judge had ordered the news media not to make the information public until after the verdict.
16957	NYT_ENG_20070430.0220.LDC2009T13	The revelation turned a victory for British authorities into a day of hand-wringing and recriminations over whether they had missed an opportunity to prevent the deadliest terrorist attack in the country's history.
16958	NYT_ENG_20070430.0220.LDC2009T13	Within an hour of the verdict, the opposition Conservative Party and survivors and relatives of the victims of the transit attack demanded an investigation into why the authorities did not act on their surveillance.
16959	NYT_ENG_20070430.0220.LDC2009T13	The connection between the two groups, both in Britain and in Pakistan, pointed to a level of organization among terrorist cells here that initially had been seen as "homegrown" and independent.
16960	NYT_ENG_20070430.0220.LDC2009T13	The two 2005 suicide bombers, like four of the five men convicted on Monday, were British citizens of Pakistani origin.
16961	NYT_ENG_20070430.0220.LDC2009T13	At least some of the men in both plots were trained at military camps in Pakistan that were suspected of connections to al-Qaida operatives.
16962	NYT_ENG_20070430.0220.LDC2009T13	That law enforcement authorities knew of a connection between the two groups is especially embarrassing because three days after the July 2005 attacks, Charles Clarke, then the home secretary, said the attack "simply came out of the blue."
16963	NYT_ENG_20070430.0220.LDC2009T13	The order of the judge, Sir Michael Astill, keeping the links between the groups secret, was lifted on Monday, as the jury delivered the verdicts after 27 days of deliberations.
16964	NYT_ENG_20070430.0220.LDC2009T13	The men were convicted of conspiracy to cause explosions by using 1,300 pounds of fertilizer stashed in a lock-up storage facility.
16965	NYT_ENG_20070430.0220.LDC2009T13	Six of the seven men on trial are of Pakistani descent

16968	NYT_ENG_20070430.0220.LDC2009T13	Astill sentenced the five convicted men to life imprisonment, saying, "You have betrayed the country that has given you every advantage in life."

16979	NYT_ENG_20070503.0117.LDC2009T13	He put those shoulders to many wheels, often effacing his own contribution in so doing.
16980	NYT_ENG_20070503.0117.LDC2009T13	This inspiring self-denying quality is at the heart of Martin Duberman's new biography, "The Worlds of Lincoln Kirstein."
16981	NYT_ENG_20070503.0117.LDC2009T13	In one aside in parentheses Duberman remarks of Kirstein, "(never a truly rich man, he gave away a larger proportion of his total wealth than most patrons of the arts ever do)."
16982	NYT_ENG_20070503.0117.LDC2009T13	The book is at its best when Kirstein (1907-1996) is successfully engaged on multiple fronts.
16983	NYT_ENG_20070503.0117.LDC2009T13	Duberman quietly marvels, as any reader must too, at how it was not enough for Kirstein in 1948 to forge the New York City Ballet, his life's single greatest project.
16984	NYT_ENG_20070503.0117.LDC2009T13	Despite the immense struggles of organization and fundraising that that task required, it also turns out that in 1948 Kirstein was busy in the art world: He organized an exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art (which he had served in many ways since its foundation) of sculpture by Elie Nadelman.
16985	NYT_ENG_20070503.0117.LDC2009T13	He also gave a lecture tour ranging from Boston to Chicago (donating all his fees to the New York City Ballet's predecessor, Ballet Society) and presented the Hunter College premiere of an opera he commissioned.
16986	NYT_ENG_20070503.0117.LDC2009T13	Kirstein had many other years as busy as that, and on just as many different fronts.
16987	NYT_ENG_20070503.0117.LDC2009T13	Duberman's biography, drawing on vast resources of unpublished diaries and correspondence, steers us through Kirstein's founding and editing of the literary magazine Hound and Horn (1927-33), his collaboration with Vaslav Nijinsky's monstrously irritating and dishonest wife, Romola, in ghostwriting her biography of her husband, his long and shifting involvement with leftist politics and his extensive work for MoMA.
16988	NYT_ENG_20070503.0117.LDC2009T13	For most of the first half of this book, however, Duberman seems too close to his research.
16989	NYT_ENG_20070503.0117.LDC2009T13	(There are two whole paragraphs on Kirstein's teenage appendicitis.)
16990	NYT_ENG_20070503.0117.LDC2009T13	But once Kirstein's plural worlds are all well defined, Duberman is driving in top gear.
16991	NYT_ENG_20070503.0117.LDC2009T13	The narrative for 1945, for example, is particularly exciting, as Kirstein, serving with the American Army in Europe, is central to the recovery of the van Eyck "Adoration of the Lamb," which the Germans had stolen in 1942 and hidden in a salt mine in Austria.
16992	NYT_ENG_20070503.0117.LDC2009T13	Since the world of the performing arts is littered with old sexual gossip, we need biographies as sensitive as Julie Kavanagh's "Secret Muses: The Life of Frederick Ashton," Meredith Daneman's "Margot Fonteyn," and now this Kirstein biography (and unlike the first two posthumous biographies of Rudolf Nureyev) to connect private life to public art with honesty, seriousness and a sense of proportion.
16993	NYT_ENG_20070503.0117.LDC2009T13	It has never been a secret that Kirstein, an intensely sexual creature, was involved with a number of men, that he did plenty of gay cruising, and that he lost his heart to a long series of Adonises.
16994	NYT_ENG_20070503.0117.LDC2009T13	Just how he combined this with some serious heterosexual relationships in his youth, and with his marriage to Fidelma Cadmus, is where Duberman is at his most delicate.
16995	NYT_ENG_20070503.0117.LDC2009T13	Although the book's first half charts a few more of Kirstein's homosexual liaisons than it needs, Duberman is never salacious.
16996	NYT_ENG_20070503.0117.LDC2009T13	And his Kirstein becomes especially vivid when in the company of women: his mother and sister, his lover and friend Muriel Draper, and Fidelma.
16997	NYT_ENG_20070503.0117.LDC2009T13	Kirstein's tender affection for her is not in question, but Duberman lets us see Fidelma as a victim of Kirstein's driven nature and of the position of women in her generation.
16998	NYT_ENG_20070503.0117.LDC2009T13	Having to play the hostess to all his guests and to live with his private obsessions was more than she could sustain.
16999	NYT_ENG_20070503.0117.LDC2009T13	Gradually she withdrew from her career as a painter and then from life.
17000	NYT_ENG_20070503.0117.LDC2009T13	Kirstein suffered from depression and was at times hospitalized
17001	NYT_ENG_20070503.0117.LDC2009T13	but his wife's breakdowns were eventually more permanent.
17002	NYT_ENG_20070503.0117.LDC2009T13	"The Worlds of Lincoln Kirstein" is so richly detailed that it must be consulted by those interested in all whom Kirstein's life brushed.
17003	NYT_ENG_20070503.0117.LDC2009T13	I spotted only one significant omission: Tennessee Williams, whom Kirstein helped early in the 1940s, albeit briefly.
17004	NYT_ENG_20070503.0117.LDC2009T13	Much new material emerges here about George Balanchine above all.
17005	NYT_ENG_20070503.0117.LDC2009T13	Yet, though Duberman knows which Balanchine ballets are the most historically important, he shows no feeling for them.
17006	NYT_ENG_20070503.0117.LDC2009T13	In that sense alone he fails his subject.
17007	NYT_ENG_20070503.0117.LDC2009T13	He quotes an astonishing 1946 letter of Kirstein's: "The only justification I have," he writes, is to enable Balanchine "to do exactly what he wants to do in the way he wants to do it."
17008	NYT_ENG_20070503.0117.LDC2009T13	What Balanchine wanted and how are left unsaid by Duberman.
17009	NYT_ENG_20070503.0117.LDC2009T13	Yet he shows us, powerfully, the titan's work, his strength and his incidental afflictions.
17010	NYT_ENG_20070503.0117.LDC2009T13	The book has a gathering force.

17019	NYT_ENG_20070505.0102.LDC2009T13	Showers and thunderstorms will erupt on the Plains once again as a slow-moving disturbance draws humid air north from the Gulf of Mexico.
17020	NYT_ENG_20070505.0102.LDC2009T13	Some of the storms will be severe, producing damaging winds and large hail.
17021	NYT_ENG_20070505.0102.LDC2009T13	Winds shifting direction and speed with altitude will also create conditions favorable for tornadoes.
17022	NYT_ENG_20070505.0102.LDC2009T13	The area at highest risk for severe weather will be from north- central Texas to central and eastern Kansas.
17023	NYT_ENG_20070505.0102.LDC2009T13	A sprawling zone of high pressure will promote sunshine and cool weather from the Great Lakes to New England.
17024	NYT_ENG_20070505.0102.LDC2009T13	Farther south, low pressure forming east of Virginia will generate chilly, wind- driven showers along parts of the Middle Atlantic Coast.
17025	NYT_ENG_20070505.0102.LDC2009T13	Scattered lowland showers and mountain snow will persist in the Rockies.

17027	NYT_ENG_20070505.0102.LDC2009T13	FOCUS: SLOW STORMS
17028	NYT_ENG_20070505.0102.LDC2009T13	Spring is the season of slow storms.
17029	NYT_ENG_20070505.0102.LDC2009T13	In spring, the jet stream vacillates, retreating north as warmer air arrives from the tropics, and surging south as the last chilly air masses empty from the arctic.
17030	NYT_ENG_20070505.0102.LDC2009T13	As a flooded river leaves pools of standing water after it recedes, the jet stream often leaves behind stagnant pools of cold air when it retreats north.
17031	NYT_ENG_20070505.0102.LDC2009T13	These high- level cold pools favor the formation of storms.
17032	NYT_ENG_20070505.0102.LDC2009T13	This weekend a slow storm in the Central states will bring more severe storms to the Plains while a slow storm in the East causes unsettled weather near the Southeast and Middle Atlantic coasts this week.

17034	NYT_ENG_20070505.0116.LDC2009T13	Cox News Service
17035	NYT_ENG_20070505.0116.LDC2009T13	ATLANTA -- Scott Avett grew up in blue-collar North Carolina and lives there to this day, in the Piedmont, on 65 acres.
17036	NYT_ENG_20070505.0116.LDC2009T13	His place is above a wood shop.
17037	NYT_ENG_20070505.0116.LDC2009T13	"It's NASCAR country," he says.
17038	NYT_ENG_20070505.0116.LDC2009T13	"It's much like 'Talladega Nights."'
17039	NYT_ENG_20070505.0116.LDC2009T13	Scott is 30 years old.
17040	NYT_ENG_20070505.0116.LDC2009T13	His father owned a welding company.
17041	NYT_ENG_20070505.0116.LDC2009T13	His mother taught reading.
17042	NYT_ENG_20070505.0116.LDC2009T13	He grew up listening to John Denver and Merle Haggard on eight-track tape.
17043	NYT_ENG_20070505.0116.LDC2009T13	Now he plays and sings in a twangy trio that bears his name - the Avett Brothers, a band that exploits the tensions between the rustic Old South and the cosmopolitan New South, between rootsy bluegrass and rowdy punk rock, between reverence and irreverence.
17044	NYT_ENG_20070505.0116.LDC2009T13	The Avett Brothers obviously respect country music
17045	NYT_ENG_20070505.0116.LDC2009T13	when they deconstruct the form, it's as though they're sacrificing a loved one in the name of art - sort of like Jimi Hendrix igniting his guitar.
17046	NYT_ENG_20070505.0116.LDC2009T13	Thanks in part to their background in a rock band, the brothers attack their instruments with destructive intensity - they once broke 32 strings in a single gig.
17047	NYT_ENG_20070505.0116.LDC2009T13	"Sometimes," says Paul Lohr, the band's booking agent, "you have to throw caution to the wind and risk some sour notes and some out of tune strings or some completely broken strings to get those moments of brilliance."
17048	NYT_ENG_20070505.0116.LDC2009T13	And yet, the Avetts can be tender.
17049	NYT_ENG_20070505.0116.LDC2009T13	They write smart, funny, heartbreaking country-tinged songs that tell shaggy dog stories and reveal surprisingly vulnerable feelings.
17050	NYT_ENG_20070505.0116.LDC2009T13	On May 15, they will release a new album called "Emotionalism."
17051	NYT_ENG_20070505.0116.LDC2009T13	The band's duality is embodied in Seth Avett, Scott's younger sibling.
17052	NYT_ENG_20070505.0116.LDC2009T13	Seth is 26 and tall as summertime corn.
17053	NYT_ENG_20070505.0116.LDC2009T13	He likes to wear a pendant that he made himself, a sculpture of a human skull with music notes for teeth.
17054	NYT_ENG_20070505.0116.LDC2009T13	Seth plays guitar and sings, sometimes rather loudly.
17055	NYT_ENG_20070505.0116.LDC2009T13	He has had to explain to Mother Avett that screaming isn't necessarily a bad thing.
17056	NYT_ENG_20070505.0116.LDC2009T13	Some emotions just can't be explained in words.
17057	NYT_ENG_20070505.0116.LDC2009T13	Seth and his bandmates travel from gig to gig in a green Ford van decorated with both a Jesus fish and a sticker for the metal band Danzig, which once released an album called "6:66 Satan's Child."
17058	NYT_ENG_20070505.0116.LDC2009T13	"You gotta be well-rounded," Seth deadpans.
17059	NYT_ENG_20070505.0116.LDC2009T13	"There's some good things to get from Danzig, and some good things to get from the fish as well."
17060	NYT_ENG_20070505.0116.LDC2009T13	And then there's Bob Crawford.
17061	NYT_ENG_20070505.0116.LDC2009T13	Bob is not an Avett brother, but he is an Avett Brother.
17062	NYT_ENG_20070505.0116.LDC2009T13	Bob is 35.
17063	NYT_ENG_20070505.0116.LDC2009T13	He plays upright bass.
17064	NYT_ENG_20070505.0116.LDC2009T13	He has read biographies of every president through Van Buren.
17065	NYT_ENG_20070505.0116.LDC2009T13	He's a Yankee.
17066	NYT_ENG_20070505.0116.LDC2009T13	He didn't discover bluegrass until a college buddy dragged him to a festival in Delaware.
17067	NYT_ENG_20070505.0116.LDC2009T13	The next day he volunteered for the 6 a.m. shift on his college radio station, playing Appalachian roots music for the good people of New Jersey.
17068	NYT_ENG_20070505.0116.LDC2009T13	"People come out to see live music down here," he says one recent night, backstage at Atlanta's Variety Playhouse.
17069	NYT_ENG_20070505.0116.LDC2009T13	"And they never did where I was from in South Jersey."
17070	NYT_ENG_20070505.0116.LDC2009T13	Getting to the roots
17071	NYT_ENG_20070505.0116.LDC2009T13	In concert and on record, the Avett Brothers make music that simultaneously upholds and demolishes the Americana tradition.
17072	NYT_ENG_20070505.0116.LDC2009T13	The Avett Brothers play acoustically, harmonize sweetly and shriek savagely.
17073	NYT_ENG_20070505.0116.LDC2009T13	Their music also has an urban knowingness despite their rural roots.
17074	NYT_ENG_20070505.0116.LDC2009T13	The two collide in a primal ballad called "Murdered in the City."
17075	NYT_ENG_20070505.0116.LDC2009T13	"Growing up in the country," Scott says, "it's been hard to adjust to the amount of time we spend in cities."
17076	NYT_ENG_20070505.0116.LDC2009T13	If the band has a leader, it's Scott.
17077	NYT_ENG_20070505.0116.LDC2009T13	In concert, he stands at center stage.
17078	NYT_ENG_20070505.0116.LDC2009T13	In conversation, he's thoughtfully chatty.
17079	NYT_ENG_20070505.0116.LDC2009T13	He's comfortable holding forth on, say, the Philadelphia painter Thomas Eakins.
17080	NYT_ENG_20070505.0116.LDC2009T13	And he describes his own development with a kind of modest nonchalance.
17081	NYT_ENG_20070505.0116.LDC2009T13	His last day job was doing janitorial work.
17082	NYT_ENG_20070505.0116.LDC2009T13	"It's the kind of stuff," he says, "where you're looking in the toilet at your reflection, wondering what it's all about."
17083	NYT_ENG_20070505.0116.LDC2009T13	After spending his younger days obsessed with grunge bands like Soundgarden and Nirvana, Scott became curious about bluegrass about a decade ago.
17084	NYT_ENG_20070505.0116.LDC2009T13	"Before that," he says, "nobody was going to pry me away from anything that wasn't sharp as a knife."
17085	NYT_ENG_20070505.0116.LDC2009T13	He picked up the banjo to distinguish himself in a world full of guitarists.
17086	NYT_ENG_20070505.0116.LDC2009T13	He learned standards including "Foggy Mountain Breakdown" and "Boil Them Cabbage" but says that he started crafting his own songs as soon as he could play chords.
17087	NYT_ENG_20070505.0116.LDC2009T13	About five years after Scott started taking lessons, he began giving them.
17088	NYT_ENG_20070505.0116.LDC2009T13	When Scott and Seth discovered that their angsty rock band, Nemo, had - as Scott puts it - "imploded upon itself," they turned to roots music and began focusing on the Avett Brothers.
17089	NYT_ENG_20070505.0116.LDC2009T13	Catharsis onstage
17090	NYT_ENG_20070505.0116.LDC2009T13	The band does not fit comfortably into any mainstream genre, or even into any established subgenre.
17091	NYT_ENG_20070505.0116.LDC2009T13	They're a little too hippie- ish for alternative country yet way too scruffy for mainstream country.
17092	NYT_ENG_20070505.0116.LDC2009T13	They exist alongside a handful of other Americana misfits, namely the shape-shifting songwriter Will Oldham and the tight string band Old Crow Medicine Show.
17093	NYT_ENG_20070505.0116.LDC2009T13	In their own ways, all three of these groups are warping the traditional sound and shape of country music.
17094	NYT_ENG_20070505.0116.LDC2009T13	"My favorite comparison to them," says agent Lohr, "is the Violent Femmes crossed with Bob Dylan.
17095	NYT_ENG_20070505.0116.LDC2009T13	Because they have that wild, unbridled stage presence.
17096	NYT_ENG_20070505.0116.LDC2009T13	Plus, Dylan is obviously one of the greatest songwriters of all time."
17097	NYT_ENG_20070505.0116.LDC2009T13	The Avett Brothers are most powerful onstage, which is where they spent about 180 nights last year.
17098	NYT_ENG_20070505.0116.LDC2009T13	They stand three across - Bob on the left, Seth on the right and Scott in the middle.
17099	NYT_ENG_20070505.0116.LDC2009T13	They dress up for shows by wearing jackets or ties, adding another layer of incongruity.
17100	NYT_ENG_20070505.0116.LDC2009T13	The formal clothes clash with the unhinged music.
17101	NYT_ENG_20070505.0116.LDC2009T13	They can also make the band members hot.
17102	NYT_ENG_20070505.0116.LDC2009T13	At a recent show in Athens' Georgia Theatre, sweat flew off Scott's head in a rainy sheet.
17103	NYT_ENG_20070505.0116.LDC2009T13	Avett concerts showcase the band's panoramic range.
17104	NYT_ENG_20070505.0116.LDC2009T13	Song forms are all over the place - ballads, rockers, folk tunes, instrumentals.
17105	NYT_ENG_20070505.0116.LDC2009T13	All three members sing.
17106	NYT_ENG_20070505.0116.LDC2009T13	The audience sometimes joins them.
17107	NYT_ENG_20070505.0116.LDC2009T13	Scott and Seth both play percussion instruments with their feet, and Bob likes to twirl his bass as though it were a dance partner.
17108	NYT_ENG_20070505.0116.LDC2009T13	To see an Avett Brothers concert is to witness an emotional and physical catharsis.
17109	NYT_ENG_20070505.0116.LDC2009T13	The effects become apparent backstage.
17110	NYT_ENG_20070505.0116.LDC2009T13	At Variety Playhouse, Seth spent the moments before the show pacing around the artist lounge area.
17111	NYT_ENG_20070505.0116.LDC2009T13	When his girlfriend asked him to sit for a moment, he replied that he couldn't do that.
17112	NYT_ENG_20070505.0116.LDC2009T13	After the show, he slumped in a chair.
17113	NYT_ENG_20070505.0116.LDC2009T13	It says something about the intensity of an Avett Brothers show that Seth Avett was unable to sit before the show, and unable to stand afterward.

17117	NYT_ENG_20070510.0270.LDC2009T13	A Hampden County man who allegedly tricked his brother's girlfriend into having sex with him by impersonating his sibling in the middle of the night cannot be convicted of rape, the state's highest court ruled Thursday in a controversial decision that affirms the court's long-held view that sex obtained through fraud is no crime.
17118	NYT_ENG_20070510.0270.LDC2009T13	The Supreme Judicial Court unanimously ruled that a judge should have dismissed the rape charge against Alvin Suliveres, 44, of Westfield, because Massachusetts law has for centuries defined rape as sexual intercourse by force and against one's will, and that it is not rape when consent is obtained through fraud.
17119	NYT_ENG_20070510.0270.LDC2009T13	If the Legislature wants to make sex through fraud qualify as rape, it should follow the lead of several other states - including Alabama, California, Michigan, and Tennessee - and change the law, the court said.
17120	NYT_ENG_20070510.0270.LDC2009T13	Brownlow M. Speer, a state public defender who represented Suliveres in the challenge, praised the ruling.
17121	NYT_ENG_20070510.0270.LDC2009T13	His client, who has been free since his March 2006 trial ended in a hung jury, denies impersonating his brother and maintains that the sex was consensual.
17122	NYT_ENG_20070510.0270.LDC2009T13	But Wendy J. Murphy, who teaches at the New England School of Law and advocates for victims of violence, condemned the ruling as regressive.
17123	NYT_ENG_20070510.0270.LDC2009T13	"The message that the court sends today is ... that a man's ability to obtain sex through fraud with regard to who he is is more important than a woman's fundamental right to control her own body," said Murphy.
17124	NYT_ENG_20070510.0270.LDC2009T13	She added, "It is impossible - as a matter of fact and law - to consent to sex with the wrong person."
17125	NYT_ENG_20070510.0270.LDC2009T13	Justice Judith A. Cowin, one of two women on the court, wrote the ruling.
17126	NYT_ENG_20070510.0270.LDC2009T13	The case dates to a night in January 2005.
17127	NYT_ENG_20070510.0270.LDC2009T13	The woman was living with her boyfriend, Duane Suliveres, in a basement room of his father's home, according to the defense brief.
17128	NYT_ENG_20070510.0270.LDC2009T13	Alvin Suliveres was also staying at the house.
17129	NYT_ENG_20070510.0270.LDC2009T13	Duane Suliveres, now 33, was working night shifts, the brief said.
17130	NYT_ENG_20070510.0270.LDC2009T13	At 3 a.m., the woman later told authorities, she was awakened by the sound of the door opening to the dark room and said, "Duane, why are you home so early?"
17131	NYT_ENG_20070510.0270.LDC2009T13	but heard no response.
17132	NYT_ENG_20070510.0270.LDC2009T13	Then, she said, someone she thought was her boyfriend got into bed, removed her clothes, and had sex with her for about 10 minutes.
17133	NYT_ENG_20070510.0270.LDC2009T13	He got up and opened the door, and she saw that it was Alvin Suliveres, she told authorities.
17134	NYT_ENG_20070510.0270.LDC2009T13	After Hampden County prosecutors presented their case, Suliveres's trial lawyer asked Superior Court Judge Tina S. Page to acquit his client for lack of evidence, but the judge refused.
17135	NYT_ENG_20070510.0270.LDC2009T13	The case went to the jury, which could not reach a verdict.

17139	NYT_ENG_20070515.0215.LDC2009T13	Was it enraged gamblers who strangled the coach?
17140	NYT_ENG_20070515.0215.LDC2009T13	Or vindictive players?
17141	NYT_ENG_20070515.0215.LDC2009T13	Or a fan with a grudge?
17142	NYT_ENG_20070515.0215.LDC2009T13	Or none of the above?
17143	NYT_ENG_20070515.0215.LDC2009T13	The latest twist in the Jamaican police investigation into the death of Bob Woolmer, the Pakistani cricket coach found unconscious in his hotel room in March during the Cricket World Cup, may be that he was not murdered at all.
17144	NYT_ENG_20070515.0215.LDC2009T13	Quoting people close to Dr. Nat Carey, a top British pathologist called in to review the postmortem on Woolmer, newspapers in Britain, where Woolmer was from, and Jamaica, where he died, are raising questions about the Jamaican authorities' claim that Woolmer was strangled.
17145	NYT_ENG_20070515.0215.LDC2009T13	The papers say Carey has determined that his review of the records does not show that Woolmer died of "asphyxia as a result of manual strangulation," as the Jamaican government has maintained.
17146	NYT_ENG_20070515.0215.LDC2009T13	A Jamaican pathologist, Ere Seshiah, originally ruled that Woolmer's death on March 18 was inconclusive.
17147	NYT_ENG_20070515.0215.LDC2009T13	Four days later, the government changed course and told the world in a dramatic news conference that the popular coach had been murdered.
17148	NYT_ENG_20070515.0215.LDC2009T13	The police say the murder investigation continues despite the news reports that Woolmer might have died of natural causes.
17149	NYT_ENG_20070515.0215.LDC2009T13	"Every theory, from weed killer to aconite, has come from the media, not the police," Mark Shields, the deputy police commissioner, told the Jamaica Observer newspaper on Monday from South Africa, where he was traveling on police business.
17150	NYT_ENG_20070515.0215.LDC2009T13	"We maintain that this is an ongoing murder investigation."
17151	NYT_ENG_20070515.0215.LDC2009T13	What made Woolmer's sudden death so suspicious is that it came in the evening after his highly regarded team lost to Ireland in a huge World Cup upset and became the first team to be eliminated from the tournament.
17152	NYT_ENG_20070515.0215.LDC2009T13	The key piece of evidence pointing toward strangulation was said to be a broken bone in Woolmer's neck.
17153	NYT_ENG_20070515.0215.LDC2009T13	But that could have broken, the speculation now goes, as Woolmer fell after dying from a heart attack or other natural causes.
17154	NYT_ENG_20070515.0215.LDC2009T13	If the case has been bungled, Jamaicans worry that their country may suffer.
17155	NYT_ENG_20070515.0215.LDC2009T13	Derrick Smith, a member of Parliament from the opposition Jamaica Labor Party, said this week that the confusion raised by the conflicting accounts jeopardized the reputation of the Jamaican police.
17156	NYT_ENG_20070515.0215.LDC2009T13	"Announcements emerging from police and medical authorities in both Britain and Pakistan indicate that Woolmer's death was from natural causes and not murder as suggested by the Jamaica police authorities," Smith said at a news conference on Monday, according to The Associated Press.
17157	NYT_ENG_20070515.0215.LDC2009T13	"The matter has become a global embarrassment for us."
17158	NYT_ENG_20070515.0215.LDC2009T13	Saying the case has gone from a "great 'whodunit"' into a farcical soap opera, The Gleaner, Jamaica's leading newspaper, called on police to release the pathology report so people can decide what the authorities cannot.
17159	NYT_ENG_20070515.0215.LDC2009T13	Another possibility remains, and that is that Woolmer was poisoned instead of choked.
17160	NYT_ENG_20070515.0215.LDC2009T13	Various reports have indicated that there were signs that Woolmer had ingested a herbicide used as a weed killer on cricket pitches.
17161	NYT_ENG_20070515.0215.LDC2009T13	The herbicide might have caused the vomiting and diarrhea that Woolmer suffered before he died.

17172	NYT_ENG_20070516.0154.LDC2009T13	Some of Giuliani's other income sources yielded much more, including $11.3 million in speakers fees and $4.1 million from his New York-based Giuliani and Company.
17173	NYT_ENG_20070516.0154.LDC2009T13	Lee Miringoff, director of the Marist College Institute of Public Opinion in New York, said that Giuliani's law firm connections have helped him in fundraising in Texas and will not likely hurt him in GOP primaries dominated by business-friendly conservative voters.

17178	NYT_ENG_20070516.0154.LDC2009T13	But Miringoff and other experts said the candidate's corporate ties and potential for conflicts of interest if he is elected to White House could hurt him among Democrats and independents, who may see a less appealing side to the candidate cast as the steely leader who guided New York City through the aftermath of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.

17198	NYT_ENG_20070518.0157.LDC2009T13	New York -- Despite objections from its flight attendants union, Northwest Airlines won court approval of its reorganization plan Friday and pushed up the date it will exit bankruptcy from June to May 31.
17199	NYT_ENG_20070518.0157.LDC2009T13	The airline expects to emerge from 20 months of Chapter 11 protection as a highly competitive carrier.
17200	NYT_ENG_20070518.0157.LDC2009T13	It forecasts 2007 earnings of nearly $800 million, in part buoyed by $2.4 billion in annual savings including $1.4 billion from employees in the form of wage, benefit and work-rule changes.
17201	NYT_ENG_20070518.0157.LDC2009T13	"We are pleased to have completed our restructuring successfully," said Doug Steenland, the Eagan, Minn.-based airline's president and chief executive officer.
17202	NYT_ENG_20070518.0157.LDC2009T13	"We are now focused on emerging from Chapter 11 as a strong, publicly traded company which will provide excellent service to our global customer base," he said.
17203	NYT_ENG_20070518.0157.LDC2009T13	"Today's court approval is the realization of the goals that were set for the airline when we entered bankruptcy protection in September 2005.
17204	NYT_ENG_20070518.0157.LDC2009T13	At that time, we pledged to achieve a competitive cost structure, a more efficient business model and a recapitalized balance sheet."

17206	NYT_ENG_20070518.0157.LDC2009T13	The company has said it will pay Steenland $26.6 million in stock and stock options when it emerges
17207	NYT_ENG_20070518.0157.LDC2009T13	overall, senior executives will own 4.9 percent of the airline.

17209	NYT_ENG_20070518.0157.LDC2009T13	"There is no dispute it is generous," Gropper said in court.
17210	NYT_ENG_20070518.0157.LDC2009T13	"Any incentive plan designed to be in the top quartile would be generous."

17212	NYT_ENG_20070518.0157.LDC2009T13	Andy Wisbecker, a vice president of the 9,000 member Northwest chapter of the Association of Flight Attendants, said it's a sad day for American workers whose taxes pay for the court system.
17213	NYT_ENG_20070518.0157.LDC2009T13	"It was a little bit of a surprise because while we know that an executive-compensation plan is part of any reorganization plan, we didn't expect it to be this outrageous and obscene of a number.
17214	NYT_ENG_20070518.0157.LDC2009T13	We thought that Judge Gropper would use a little bit of fairness in his ruling, but he didn't do anything about it."

17216	NYT_ENG_20070518.0157.LDC2009T13	Gropper allowed Northwest to impose the cuts last July after the attendants rejected two previous agreements.

17218	NYT_ENG_20070518.0157.LDC2009T13	One airline expert said the court's approval of the plan came as no surprise.
17219	NYT_ENG_20070518.0157.LDC2009T13	Michael Boyd, an aviation consultant in Evergreen, Colo., said it's clear that Northwest has its act together and knows how to avert red ink like the $4 billion in losses it suffered since 2001.

17221	NYT_ENG_20070518.0157.LDC2009T13	They will grow around their global hub in Detroit and their route system to Asia."
17222	NYT_ENG_20070518.0157.LDC2009T13	Boyd said Steenland's $26.6 million incentive package is much less than the $40 million the United Airlines top executive got when that carrier exited bankruptcy in February 2006 -- and United is still in trouble.

17225	NYT_ENG_20070518.0157.LDC2009T13	Northwest is now ready to bolt into the future."

17243	NYT_ENG_20070525.0228.LDC2009T13	The decision by two of the leading Democratic presidential candidates to vote against a bill providing more money for the war in Iraq because it did not set a timetable to withdraw the troops reverberated on the campaign trail yesterday, underscoring the deep divisions over the war between Democrats and Republicans.
17244	NYT_ENG_20070525.0228.LDC2009T13	The two Democrats, Sens. Hillary Rodham Clinton and Barack Obama, quickly found their votes attacked by Republicans.
17245	NYT_ENG_20070525.0228.LDC2009T13	Sen. John McCain and Mitt Romney, two Republican presidential candidates who had been feuding all week, found common ground in denouncing Clinton and Obama.
17246	NYT_ENG_20070525.0228.LDC2009T13	McCain, of Arizona, said he was disappointed to see them "embrace the policy of surrender by voting against funds to support our brave men and women fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan."
17247	NYT_ENG_20070525.0228.LDC2009T13	Romney, a former governor of Massachusetts, said that "voting against our troops during a time of war shows the American people that the leaders of the Democrat Party will abandon principle in favor of political positioning."
17248	NYT_ENG_20070525.0228.LDC2009T13	Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former mayor of New York and a Republican presidential hopeful, said later in the day that the Democrats were "in denial of the war on terrorism."
17249	NYT_ENG_20070525.0228.LDC2009T13	Obama countered with a sharp statement of his own.
17250	NYT_ENG_20070525.0228.LDC2009T13	"This country is united in our support for our troops, but we also owe them a plan to relieve them of the burden of policing someone else's civil war," he said.
17251	NYT_ENG_20070525.0228.LDC2009T13	"Governor Romney and Senator McCain clearly believe the course we are on in Iraq is working, but I do not."
17252	NYT_ENG_20070525.0228.LDC2009T13	"And if there ever was a reflection of that," Obama continued, "it's the fact that Senator McCain required a flack jacket, 10 armored Humvees, 2 Apache attack helicopters and 100 soldiers with rifles by his side to stroll through a market in Baghdad just a few weeks ago."
17253	NYT_ENG_20070525.0228.LDC2009T13	McCain did not leave that alone.
17254	NYT_ENG_20070525.0228.LDC2009T13	"By the way, Senator Obama," he said in a statement, "it's a 'flak' jacket, not a 'flack' jacket."
17255	NYT_ENG_20070525.0228.LDC2009T13	Clinton, for her part, said, "I fully support our troops, and wish the president had followed the will of the people and signed the original bill we sent which both funded the troops and set a new course of phased redeployment."
17256	NYT_ENG_20070525.0228.LDC2009T13	The divisions did not run strictly along party lines.
17257	NYT_ENG_20070525.0228.LDC2009T13	While Sen. Christopher J. Dodd, D-Conn., voted against the bill, another Democratic presidential candidate, Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr. of Delaware, voted for it.
17258	NYT_ENG_20070525.0228.LDC2009T13	McCain voted for it.
17259	NYT_ENG_20070525.0228.LDC2009T13	Sen. Sam Brownback, R-Kan., another presidential candidate, did not vote.
17260	NYT_ENG_20070525.0228.LDC2009T13	In the House, two Republican presidential hopefuls, Reps. Duncan Hunter of California and Tom Tancredo of Colorado, supported the bill.
17261	NYT_ENG_20070525.0228.LDC2009T13	Two other candidates, Reps. Dennis J. Kucinich, D-Ohio, and Ron Paul, R-Texas, opposed it.
17262	NYT_ENG_20070525.0228.LDC2009T13	Obama was the first to cast his vote against the bill on Thursday.
17263	NYT_ENG_20070525.0228.LDC2009T13	Within minutes, Clinton strode into the chamber and voted.
17264	NYT_ENG_20070525.0228.LDC2009T13	Clinton dismissed the idea that she would pay for this vote in a general election, with Republican accusations that she had abandoned troops.
17265	NYT_ENG_20070525.0228.LDC2009T13	"Nobody believes that," she said.
17266	NYT_ENG_20070525.0228.LDC2009T13	"That's just propaganda."
17267	NYT_ENG_20070525.0228.LDC2009T13	Clinton also dismissed a reporter's suggestion that her votes had closely tracked Obama's in recent months.
17268	NYT_ENG_20070525.0228.LDC2009T13	"I think it's the other way around, don't you?"
17269	NYT_ENG_20070525.0228.LDC2009T13	she said.
17270	NYT_ENG_20070605.0003.LDC2009T13	A BLUEPRINT FOR A COMEBACK, BUT NOT THE TOOLS
17271	NYT_ENG_20070605.0003.LDC2009T13	Until the Red Sox won the World Series in 2004, they had long tortured their frenzied fans by practicing what I called the Ultimate Tease.
17272	NYT_ENG_20070605.0003.LDC2009T13	They would lure their fans into thinking they were going to win the World Series so they could obliterate "1918" from their vocabulary, then fall short at the last moment, sometimes in the regular season, like in 1978, sometimes in the postseason, like in 2003 and 1986.
17273	NYT_ENG_20070605.0003.LDC2009T13	Now that 2004 is behind them, the Red Sox are in perfect position to stage Ultimate Tease II.
17274	NYT_ENG_20070605.0003.LDC2009T13	I know a Boston-area resident who is rooting for Ultimate Tease II.
17275	NYT_ENG_20070605.0003.LDC2009T13	A Red Sox fan but nevertheless a rational person, my friend the fan explained the reason during last weekend in Boston.
17276	NYT_ENG_20070605.0003.LDC2009T13	In April, Sharon related, a furniture store in her Boston suburb -- I won't identify the town because if the Red Sox don't win this year, frenzied fans could blame her and burn down her house -- had a Red Sox-related sales gimmick.
17277	NYT_ENG_20070605.0003.LDC2009T13	Buy furniture now, and if the Red Sox win the World Series this year, it will be free.
17278	NYT_ENG_20070605.0003.LDC2009T13	Her reason for rooting against the Red Sox is simple.
17279	NYT_ENG_20070605.0003.LDC2009T13	She was unable to buy the furniture at the time, and if the Red Sox win and it turns out that she could have had the furniture for nothing, she would be very upset with herself.
17280	NYT_ENG_20070605.0003.LDC2009T13	The Red Sox are acting as if they plan at least to win the American League East, finishing ahead of the Yankees for the first time in a dozen years.
17281	NYT_ENG_20070605.0003.LDC2009T13	That is, they acted that way until Sunday night.
17282	NYT_ENG_20070605.0003.LDC2009T13	Nearly four months -- more than 100 games -- remain in the season, but had the Red Sox held on to their 5-4 lead, they might have driven a stake into the heart of the Evil Empire.
17283	NYT_ENG_20070605.0003.LDC2009T13	But Hideki Okajima couldn't hold the lead, and Jonathan Papelbon couldn't maintain the tie, and the Yankees scored a victory that could have far greater ramifications than a game in the standings in June.
17284	NYT_ENG_20070605.0003.LDC2009T13	"It can go a long way," said Ron Guidry, the Yankees' pitching coach, who speaks from experience, an experience Boston fans thought they had finally ripped from their psyches.
17285	NYT_ENG_20070605.0003.LDC2009T13	Guidry pitched -- brilliantly -- for the 1978 Yankees, who overcame a 14-game deficit, caught the Red Sox in September, beat them in a one-game playoff in October and went on to win the World Series for the second successive season.
17286	NYT_ENG_20070605.0003.LDC2009T13	Had these Red Sox won Sunday, they would have led the Yankees by 14 1/2 games.
17287	NYT_ENG_20070605.0003.LDC2009T13	That's an interesting number, because some people believe the Red Sox' lead over the Yankees in July 1978 was 14 1/2 games when it was only 14.
17288	NYT_ENG_20070605.0003.LDC2009T13	Maybe the outcome of Sunday night's game will be immaterial -- the Yankees failed to build on their momentum by losing in Chicago on Monday night -- but a Red Sox victory could have delivered a mortal blow.
17289	NYT_ENG_20070605.0003.LDC2009T13	Joe Torre talked the other day about a renewed fight and spirit he saw in his team, though his view sounded like something he said he saw a couple of weeks ago.
17290	NYT_ENG_20070605.0003.LDC2009T13	That fight and spirit may have evaporated with a loss, and a bad season would have turned into a long, bad season.
17291	NYT_ENG_20070605.0003.LDC2009T13	Losing two games with Mike Mussina and Andy Pettitte pitching would have been especially discouraging.
17292	NYT_ENG_20070605.0003.LDC2009T13	The Sunday night victory, however, could serve as a catalyst for a comeback.
17293	NYT_ENG_20070605.0003.LDC2009T13	With 17 weeks left, the Yankees have to gain less than a game a week to catch the Red Sox.
17294	NYT_ENG_20070605.0003.LDC2009T13	"Winning this way, hopefully it's a sign of things to come for us," general manager Brian Cashman said.
17295	NYT_ENG_20070605.0003.LDC2009T13	"We're living a Stephen King-type novel, but we have a chance to change the end of the story here.
17296	NYT_ENG_20070605.0003.LDC2009T13	It's going to take a long time and a lot of hard work.
17297	NYT_ENG_20070605.0003.LDC2009T13	We're not giving up.
17298	NYT_ENG_20070605.0003.LDC2009T13	This was a great win for us."
17299	NYT_ENG_20070605.0003.LDC2009T13	In 1978, the Yankees were 14 games behind the Red Sox for three days in July.
17300	NYT_ENG_20070605.0003.LDC2009T13	On the third day, the Yankees began a five-game winning streak.
17301	NYT_ENG_20070605.0003.LDC2009T13	On the day they won their fifth straight, the Red Sox lost their fourth in a row, and that quickly, a 14-game lead had become 10.
17302	NYT_ENG_20070605.0003.LDC2009T13	On that day, July 23, Reggie Jackson returned from a four-game suspension and Billy Martin said of him and George Steinbrenner, "The two of them deserve each other
17303	NYT_ENG_20070605.0003.LDC2009T13	one's a born liar, the other's convicted."
17304	NYT_ENG_20070605.0003.LDC2009T13	The next day, Martin tearfully resigned and was replaced by Bob Lemon.
17305	NYT_ENG_20070605.0003.LDC2009T13	Calm descended on the Yankees' clubhouse.
17306	NYT_ENG_20070605.0003.LDC2009T13	In the next eight weeks, the Yankees went 38-14, while the Red Sox went 24-28.
17307	NYT_ENG_20070605.0003.LDC2009T13	That 14-game deficit was now a three-and-a-half- game lead.
17308	NYT_ENG_20070605.0003.LDC2009T13	Guidry said he wasn't sure what effect Lemon's presence had on the comeback.
17309	NYT_ENG_20070605.0003.LDC2009T13	"I can't say that that was the deciding factor, but it was one factor," he said.
17310	NYT_ENG_20070605.0003.LDC2009T13	"It brought some calmness to the clubhouse."
17311	NYT_ENG_20070605.0003.LDC2009T13	The 2007 clubhouse is already calm.
17312	NYT_ENG_20070605.0003.LDC2009T13	Torre is similar to Lemon in that respect.
17313	NYT_ENG_20070605.0003.LDC2009T13	But these Yankees don't have the pitching those Yankees had.
17314	NYT_ENG_20070605.0003.LDC2009T13	"You need to have the pitchers doing their job," Guidry said.
17315	NYT_ENG_20070605.0003.LDC2009T13	"Right now, that's where we're weak."
17316	NYT_ENG_20070605.0003.LDC2009T13	If the Yankees don't stage a comeback, they will fail because their pitching isn't good enough to sustain the necessary winning streaks.
17317	NYT_ENG_20070605.0003.LDC2009T13	The Red Sox's pitching, meanwhile, may be too strong to allow losing streaks.
17318	NYT_ENG_20070605.0003.LDC2009T13	But Guidry said after the Sunday night surprise: "This team still has character.
17319	NYT_ENG_20070605.0003.LDC2009T13	A game like tonight shows that."
17320	NYT_ENG_20070612.0028.LDC2009T13	GONZALEZ DOUBLES DODGERS ' PLEASURE
17321	NYT_ENG_20070612.0028.LDC2009T13	LOS ANGELES
17322	NYT_ENG_20070612.0028.LDC2009T13	Luis Gonzalez wouldn't say his pride had been wounded, because to admit that would have been to wound it further.
17323	NYT_ENG_20070612.0028.LDC2009T13	But for an accomplished veteran with an eye on Cooperstown who claimed to have simply shrugged off the indignity of having been pinch hit for in the eighth inning of a close game, the Dodgers left fielder sure had a vivid recollection of the moment, despite the more than two weeks that had passed.
17324	NYT_ENG_20070612.0028.LDC2009T13	"And I hit that guy well, too," Gonzalez said after Monday night's game, a badly needed 5-3 victory over the New York Mets in front of 40,467 at Dodger Stadium.
17325	NYT_ENG_20070612.0028.LDC2009T13	"But it was no big deal.
17326	NYT_ENG_20070612.0028.LDC2009T13	I'm not the manager, and I don't care what happens with the lineup.
17327	NYT_ENG_20070612.0028.LDC2009T13	(But) obviously, I want to be hitting in that situation."
17328	NYT_ENG_20070612.0028.LDC2009T13	There is one other thing Gonzalez still won't admit about that moment, which occurred in a loss to the Chicago Cubs on May 26, when Jeff Kent was summoned off the bench to face Will Ohman with the bases loaded and two outs, only to take a called third strike.
17329	NYT_ENG_20070612.0028.LDC2009T13	Gonzalez won't admit it had anything to do with a personal resurgence that already had begun in the days leading up to that game, but that seemed to hit full stride immediately thereafter.
17330	NYT_ENG_20070612.0028.LDC2009T13	At this stage of his career, and with his 40th birthday looming later this summer, Gonzalez doesn't need personal affronts to get him going.
17331	NYT_ENG_20070612.0028.LDC2009T13	Thus, it must be a coincidence that in the 14games since that one, Gonzalez is batting .358 (19 for 58) with three of his eight home runs and eight of his 14 doubles.
17332	NYT_ENG_20070612.0028.LDC2009T13	That includes his two most recent two-baggers, both off quirky Mets right-hander Orlando "El Duque" Hernandez.
17333	NYT_ENG_20070612.0028.LDC2009T13	One keyed a three-run, score-tying rally in the fourth inning, and the other kicked off a two-run sixth that carried the Dodgers to arguably their most desperately needed win of the season.
17334	NYT_ENG_20070612.0028.LDC2009T13	Those doubles also carried Gonzalez past Dodgers hitting coach Eddie Murray into 19thplace on the all-time career list with 561.
17335	NYT_ENG_20070612.0028.LDC2009T13	"Eddie was great," Gonzalez said.
17336	NYT_ENG_20070612.0028.LDC2009T13	"We took a couple of photos afterward, just memories for me to put up in my home later on down the road.
17337	NYT_ENG_20070612.0028.LDC2009T13	I have always been a doubles hitter.
17338	NYT_ENG_20070612.0028.LDC2009T13	I think the art of doubles has been lost the last 10 years, because everyone is more concerned with home runs.
17339	NYT_ENG_20070612.0028.LDC2009T13	I have always thought doubles kept rallies going, but home runs pay more.
17340	NYT_ENG_20070612.0028.LDC2009T13	"But the important thing for us was that it was just nice to win."
17341	NYT_ENG_20070612.0028.LDC2009T13	Even last season, when Gonzalez was deemed by some -- especially by the management of the Arizona Diamondbacks, which decided not to re-sign him after eight productive seasons there -- to be declining with age, he slammed 52 doubles.
17342	NYT_ENG_20070612.0028.LDC2009T13	They were as much a reason as any why the Dodgers chose to snatch him up for one year and $7.35 million.
17343	NYT_ENG_20070612.0028.LDC2009T13	But after a slow start in which he made too many early-count outs and didn't produce nearly as much as a fifth-place hitter should, Gonzalez put in countless hours in the cage, much of them under the discerning eye of the man whom he would soon pass on that all-time doubles list.
17344	NYT_ENG_20070612.0028.LDC2009T13	The result has been what at worst could be described as a hot streak.
17345	NYT_ENG_20070612.0028.LDC2009T13	And what at best could be described as the rebirth of a career.
17346	NYT_ENG_20070612.0028.LDC2009T13	"He has had it right there for a while, and he worked hard to get there," Dodgers manager Grady Little said.
17347	NYT_ENG_20070612.0028.LDC2009T13	"He is seeing more pitches, and a lot of times, when pitchers make tough pitches to this guy, he fouls them off.
17348	NYT_ENG_20070612.0028.LDC2009T13	He isn't swinging and missing at them.
17349	NYT_ENG_20070612.0028.LDC2009T13	He fouls them off until he gets something he can handle."
17350	NYT_ENG_20070612.0028.LDC2009T13	Gonzalez's first double drove in Russell Martin, slicing what had been a 3-0 Mets lead to 3-2 and continuing the all-too-rare rally that began with a walk by Juan Pierre, just his 10th in 280plate appearances.
17351	NYT_ENG_20070612.0028.LDC2009T13	Andre Ethier, who came to idolize Gonzalez while playing at Arizona State, then picked up Gonzalez with an RBI single to left, tying the score.
17352	NYT_ENG_20070612.0028.LDC2009T13	Gonzalez's other double, the one that pushed Murray to 20thplace, led off the sixth inning with the score still tied.
17353	NYT_ENG_20070612.0028.LDC2009T13	One out later, promising rookie James Loney -- another guy who figures to make a nice career out of plugging gaps and taking two -- doubled to the wall in left-center, scoring Gonzalez with the go-ahead run.
17354	NYT_ENG_20070612.0028.LDC2009T13	Loney later scored on Wilson Betemit's pinch-hit single, giving the Dodgers all the insurance they would need to move within a game of Arizona and San Diego for first place in the National League West.

17357	NYT_ENG_20070618.0190.LDC2009T13	I grew up in a lead cocoon.
17358	NYT_ENG_20070618.0190.LDC2009T13	My father, Dr. William S. Altman, known as Sol, was a radiologist, and his office and its X-ray machines occupied the first floor of our house in Quincy, Mass.

17364	NYT_ENG_20070618.0190.LDC2009T13	Radiology has made major advances since Wilhelm K. Roentgen discovered X-rays in 1895 in Germany, providing the first opportunity to see inside a body without opening it up.

17369	NYT_ENG_20070618.0190.LDC2009T13	My father was a man of enormous patience and a wonderful sense of humor who liked dealing with people.
17370	NYT_ENG_20070618.0190.LDC2009T13	All of that contributed to an excellent bedside manner.
17371	NYT_ENG_20070618.0190.LDC2009T13	In the early 1930s, after a year in general medicine, he became one of the first trained radiologists in this country.
17372	NYT_ENG_20070618.0190.LDC2009T13	He changed fields in part because of a love of tinkering that he learned from his own father, who was an electrician.
17373	NYT_ENG_20070618.0190.LDC2009T13	Fully respecting the hazards of radiation, he always wore cumbersome but protective lead aprons and gloves while working, unlike some colleagues, who later succumbed to leukemia and other blood ailments.
17374	NYT_ENG_20070618.0190.LDC2009T13	He lived to 83
17375	NYT_ENG_20070618.0190.LDC2009T13	those who died younger included general practitioners who took X-rays in their offices.
17376	NYT_ENG_20070618.0190.LDC2009T13	My father, like many radiologists, split the day between home and hospital offices.
17377	NYT_ENG_20070618.0190.LDC2009T13	Occasionally he wrote scientific articles and reviews.
17378	NYT_ENG_20070618.0190.LDC2009T13	Twice a week he volunteered to teach at Tufts University, where he and I attended medical school, and to join colleagues who shared X-rays of their most perplexing or interesting cases.
17379	NYT_ENG_20070618.0190.LDC2009T13	Routine use of X-rays caught on slowly in this country.
17380	NYT_ENG_20070618.0190.LDC2009T13	In important ways, U.S. radiology was a specialty imported from Germany.
17381	NYT_ENG_20070618.0190.LDC2009T13	In bringing their expertise and equipment, German and Austrian refugee radiologists made Boston an early national leader in the field.
17382	NYT_ENG_20070618.0190.LDC2009T13	The name of one, Dr. Richard Schatzki, is now attached to a circular narrowing of the esophagus -- a Schatzki ring -- that causes food to stick in the gullet of many patients.
17383	NYT_ENG_20070618.0190.LDC2009T13	In time, American leaders emerged, and they joined the conferences when visiting Boston.
17384	NYT_ENG_20070618.0190.LDC2009T13	One, Dr. Henry S. Kaplan, cured a case of Hodgkin's disease with radiation at Stanford, and I studied with him there as a visiting medical student.
17385	NYT_ENG_20070618.0190.LDC2009T13	Radiologists were said to work regular hours, but that was a myth.
17386	NYT_ENG_20070618.0190.LDC2009T13	Often a middle-of-the-night call from the hospital would summon my father to look at the X-rays of accident victims and patients needing emergency surgery.
17387	NYT_ENG_20070618.0190.LDC2009T13	He considered the trips a normal part of his job.
17388	NYT_ENG_20070618.0190.LDC2009T13	While emergency X-rays were performed at the local hospital, office practices handled elective cases.
17389	NYT_ENG_20070618.0190.LDC2009T13	Some patients rang the office bell because they wanted an X-ray and expected it on demand, even in the middle of the night.
17390	NYT_ENG_20070618.0190.LDC2009T13	My father explained calmly that radiologists never accepted a patient without a doctor's referral.
17391	NYT_ENG_20070618.0190.LDC2009T13	The office telephone also rang in our living quarters because doctors and patients called at all hours to make appointments.
17392	NYT_ENG_20070618.0190.LDC2009T13	My mother (Esther), my sister (Dorothy) or I would record an agreed- upon time in the appointment book and pass on to the patient instructions like not eating or drinking from midnight before the day of the requested procedure.
17393	NYT_ENG_20070618.0190.LDC2009T13	Radiologists sometimes made house calls, usually for patients bedridden with a fractured hip.
17394	NYT_ENG_20070618.0190.LDC2009T13	Dad's "black bag" was a portable X-ray machine the size of a large suitcase and heavy.
17395	NYT_ENG_20070618.0190.LDC2009T13	Use of portable X-rays was limited, because the radiation exposure time was long and the quality of the films seldom matched those taken in an office.
17396	NYT_ENG_20070618.0190.LDC2009T13	The first-floor waiting room was paneled in knotty pine.
17397	NYT_ENG_20070618.0190.LDC2009T13	Magazines were piled on stands next to the chairs.
17398	NYT_ENG_20070618.0190.LDC2009T13	To preserve the quiet atmosphere, my father would not let me take up the trumpet or drums.
17399	NYT_ENG_20070618.0190.LDC2009T13	(He encouraged me to take piano and clarinet lessons, but the sour notes I produced upstairs could not have sounded any better.)
17400	NYT_ENG_20070618.0190.LDC2009T13	Two rooms were for diagnostic X-rays, mostly of bones, lungs, kidneys and bowels.
17401	NYT_ENG_20070618.0190.LDC2009T13	Mammograms were rarely performed in those days.
17402	NYT_ENG_20070618.0190.LDC2009T13	Fluoroscopy -- the use of X-rays and a fluorescent screen to produce images of the body's internal structures, such as the stomach and intestines -- was a standard procedure, performed in the dark.
17403	NYT_ENG_20070618.0190.LDC2009T13	To see better, fluoroscopists wore red goggles
17404	NYT_ENG_20070618.0190.LDC2009T13	because it took time to adapt vision from light to dark, they would often wear them for about a half-hour beforehand.
17405	NYT_ENG_20070618.0190.LDC2009T13	When my father went from the home office to the hospital to do fluoroscopies, my mother often drove him.
17406	NYT_ENG_20070618.0190.LDC2009T13	(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)
17407	NYT_ENG_20070618.0190.LDC2009T13	Dad also performed special procedures.
17408	NYT_ENG_20070618.0190.LDC2009T13	The one he hated most was a pneumoencephalogram, in which he had to insert a needle in a patient's lower back, remove spinal fluid and inject air.
17409	NYT_ENG_20070618.0190.LDC2009T13	That procedure could outline the ventricles in the brain on X-rays.
17410	NYT_ENG_20070618.0190.LDC2009T13	But the patient invariably suffered an excruciating headache, and only the rare patient would agree to any additional test.
17411	NYT_ENG_20070618.0190.LDC2009T13	Now the accuracy of CT and MRI scans have made pneumoencephalograms a relic of the past, as they have a number of other once-routine procedures.
17412	NYT_ENG_20070618.0190.LDC2009T13	A third room was for a different form of X-ray -- radiation therapy.
17413	NYT_ENG_20070618.0190.LDC2009T13	Sometimes it was curative.
17414	NYT_ENG_20070618.0190.LDC2009T13	But mostly it provided symptomatic relief and palliation, particularly in cancer, making radiologists known as "the cancer doctors."
17415	NYT_ENG_20070618.0190.LDC2009T13	Before the introduction of steroid drugs, a small blast or two of radiation often was given for a few benign conditions.
17416	NYT_ENG_20070618.0190.LDC2009T13	One was bursitis in the shoulder
17417	NYT_ENG_20070618.0190.LDC2009T13	radiation quickly relieved the pain and, with exercises, allowed restoration of full shoulder motion.
17418	NYT_ENG_20070618.0190.LDC2009T13	Now radiation is rarely given for noncancerous ailments.
17419	NYT_ENG_20070618.0190.LDC2009T13	Dad also used radium to treat cancers, mostly those of the cervix and uterus.
17420	NYT_ENG_20070618.0190.LDC2009T13	He stored the radium in a lead-lined case in a safe in the cellar.
17421	NYT_ENG_20070618.0190.LDC2009T13	Today, we would call such treatments palliative, though they were not regarded that way in an era when most cancers were detected in their late stages.
17422	NYT_ENG_20070618.0190.LDC2009T13	In my youth, chemotherapy was in its infancy, and people spoke about cancer in euphemisms.
17423	NYT_ENG_20070618.0190.LDC2009T13	In something rarely seen today, many patients arrived with cancers that were so advanced they formed festering ulcers.
17424	NYT_ENG_20070618.0190.LDC2009T13	Maggots even grew in a few such cancers.
17425	NYT_ENG_20070618.0190.LDC2009T13	X-ray films were developed in a darkened room with the type of chemical solutions used for camera film.
17426	NYT_ENG_20070618.0190.LDC2009T13	A technician mixed fresh solutions daily, and they stank.
17427	NYT_ENG_20070618.0190.LDC2009T13	Radiologists would give a preliminary "wet reading" after looking at the X-rays before they dried.
17428	NYT_ENG_20070618.0190.LDC2009T13	The digital age has eliminated those steps by making X-ray film obsolete.
17429	NYT_ENG_20070618.0190.LDC2009T13	One convenience of a home office was that my father could go upstairs to nap.
17430	NYT_ENG_20070618.0190.LDC2009T13	The bathroom doubled as a library, with stacks of the latest scientific journals.
17431	NYT_ENG_20070618.0190.LDC2009T13	After dinner with the family, Dad went down to the office, stood before a viewing box, examined each patient's dry X-ray films and dictated reports far into the night.
17432	NYT_ENG_20070618.0190.LDC2009T13	I do not remember how old I was when I first joined him and peered over a shoulder at the films.
17433	NYT_ENG_20070618.0190.LDC2009T13	But I have vivid memories of a number of patients who had large areas in their lung X-rays that appeared white, instead of the normal black, from silicosis -- a serious disease that many workers acquired in the local granite quarries.
17434	NYT_ENG_20070618.0190.LDC2009T13	In such cases, my father taught me to take a closer look because silicosis increased the risk of tuberculosis.
17435	NYT_ENG_20070618.0190.LDC2009T13	To the untrained eye, X-rays were mostly uninterpretable shadows.
17436	NYT_ENG_20070618.0190.LDC2009T13	Radiologists learn to look at them in a disciplined, systematic way.
17437	NYT_ENG_20070618.0190.LDC2009T13	For example, they scan the chest X-rays that were taken at various angles.
17438	NYT_ENG_20070618.0190.LDC2009T13	Then they look at the lungs, heart and ribs in detail.
17439	NYT_ENG_20070618.0190.LDC2009T13	"The more experienced eye can take in a complex pattern of shadows and images almost at a glance and become instinctively sensitive to an abnormal contour or shadow," said Dr. Joseph T. Ferrucci Jr., the emeritus chairman of radiology at Boston University, whose radiologist father was one of my dad's colleagues.
17440	NYT_ENG_20070618.0190.LDC2009T13	Radiologists and other medical specialists have a different perspective on patients and their diseases.
17441	NYT_ENG_20070618.0190.LDC2009T13	As one aphorism puts it: A physician sees a patient at the bedside and imagines the disease.
17442	NYT_ENG_20070618.0190.LDC2009T13	A radiologist sees the disease on the film and imagines the patient.
17443	NYT_ENG_20070618.0190.LDC2009T13	As X-ray technology improved, my father often replaced older machines with newer, larger and more powerful ones that produced better pictures.
17444	NYT_ENG_20070618.0190.LDC2009T13	Ultimately he had to expand the office to the point where only a rock garden was left between the front of the house and the street.
17445	NYT_ENG_20070618.0190.LDC2009T13	The equipment often broke down.
17446	NYT_ENG_20070618.0190.LDC2009T13	When the X-ray repairmen came, my father joined them in spreading across the floor the diagrams needed to trace the complex circuitry and pinpoint the problem.
17447	NYT_ENG_20070618.0190.LDC2009T13	His acumen was so sharp that Harvey Picker, whose company made X-ray machines, came along.
17448	NYT_ENG_20070618.0190.LDC2009T13	I did not inherit those interests.
17449	NYT_ENG_20070618.0190.LDC2009T13	My father was curious about the causes of the medical problems he saw and sought ways to prevent them.
17450	NYT_ENG_20070618.0190.LDC2009T13	He drew out epidemiologic information by talking with patients.
17451	NYT_ENG_20070618.0190.LDC2009T13	For example, he asked victims of automobile accidents about the model and color of the cars involved.
17452	NYT_ENG_20070618.0190.LDC2009T13	Because so many victims said the color was dark, he bought only light-colored cars (much easier to see at night) and advised others to do likewise.
17453	NYT_ENG_20070618.0190.LDC2009T13	Other conversations and observations convinced him, long before the 1964 surgeon general's report, that cigarette smoking caused lung cancer.
17454	NYT_ENG_20070618.0190.LDC2009T13	No one in our household smoked, though relatives who did died from ailments related to smoking.
17455	NYT_ENG_20070618.0190.LDC2009T13	My father was puzzled by why so many workers at the Fore River shipyard in Quincy developed mesotheliomas and other cancers.
17456	NYT_ENG_20070618.0190.LDC2009T13	He tried to persuade the owners to find out why.
17457	NYT_ENG_20070618.0190.LDC2009T13	Doctors later determined that many were from asbestos.
17458	NYT_ENG_20070618.0190.LDC2009T13	Those anecdotes and studies kindled my interest in epidemiology.
17459	NYT_ENG_20070618.0190.LDC2009T13	Dad and other radiologists would be irked when referring doctors failed to communicate the specific symptoms and physical findings that led them to order a patient's X-rays.
17460	NYT_ENG_20070618.0190.LDC2009T13	Such details help radiologists know what to look for.
17461	NYT_ENG_20070618.0190.LDC2009T13	The lack of precise information is still is a common problem between radiologists and referring doctors.
17462	NYT_ENG_20070618.0190.LDC2009T13	And that is a symptom of a much larger problem: lapses in communication among medical professionals and the public.
17463	NYT_ENG_20070618.0190.LDC2009T13	It was partly to remedy such lapses, and partly to inform the public about medicine and its advances, that I chose the specialty I have pursued for four decades: medical journalism.
17464	NYT_ENG_20070619.0208.LDC2009T13	PURSUIT OF QAIDA FIGHTERS BEGINS BY BLOCKING ESCAPE
17465	NYT_ENG_20070619.0208.LDC2009T13	BAQOUBA, Iraq
17466	NYT_ENG_20070619.0208.LDC2009T13	In more than four years in Iraq, American forces have been confounded by insurgents who have often slipped away only to fight another day.
17467	NYT_ENG_20070619.0208.LDC2009T13	The war in Iraq has been likened to the arcade game of whack-a-mole, where as soon as you knock down one mole another pops up.
17468	NYT_ENG_20070619.0208.LDC2009T13	Taking the fight to insurgents from al-Qaida did not so much destroy them in Anbar Province as dislodge them, prompting the fighters to build up their strength elsewhere, including Baqouba, the capital of Diyala Province.
17469	NYT_ENG_20070619.0208.LDC2009T13	So the planners of this latest operation are attempting to plug the holes that have allowed the insurgents to escape in the past.
17470	NYT_ENG_20070619.0208.LDC2009T13	The goal is not merely to reclaim western Baqouba from insurgent control, but to capture or kill the estimated 300 fighters to 500 fighters who are believed to be based in that part of the city.
17471	NYT_ENG_20070619.0208.LDC2009T13	By the time dawn broke on Tuesday, the insurgent sanctuary in western Baqouba had been cordoned off.
17472	NYT_ENG_20070619.0208.LDC2009T13	Then, the American forces established footholds on the periphery of the section and slowly pressed in.
17473	NYT_ENG_20070619.0208.LDC2009T13	"Rather than let the problem export to some other place and then have to fight them again, my goal is to isolate this thing and cordon it off," said Col. Steve Townsend, the commander of the 3rd Stryker Brigade Combat Team, 2nd Infantry Division.
17474	NYT_ENG_20070619.0208.LDC2009T13	It promises to be a methodical, steady squeeze against fighters from al-Qaida of Mesopotamia, who have fortified their positions and have shown no signs of giving in.
17475	NYT_ENG_20070619.0208.LDC2009T13	The problem of collaring the Qaida fighters is challenging in several respects.
17476	NYT_ENG_20070619.0208.LDC2009T13	Unlike Fallujah, where most of the population fled in advance of the battle, thousands of civilians remain in the western section of the city.
17477	NYT_ENG_20070619.0208.LDC2009T13	American helicopters dropped leaflets last night urging the residents to stay in their homes.
17478	NYT_ENG_20070619.0208.LDC2009T13	The hope was to keep civilians off the streets while American forces began to close in on the insurgents.
17479	NYT_ENG_20070619.0208.LDC2009T13	The appeal appeared to have little effect, though, as large groups of civilians mingled on the streets Tuesday and some students even sought to go to the local university.
17480	NYT_ENG_20070619.0208.LDC2009T13	The presence of so many civilians on an urban battlefield affords the operatives from al-Qaida another possible means to elude their American pursuers.
17481	NYT_ENG_20070619.0208.LDC2009T13	If the insurgents do not manage to sneak out some may hide their arms and try to blend with the city's residents.
17482	NYT_ENG_20070619.0208.LDC2009T13	To frustrate such plans, the Americans intend to take fingerprints and other biometric data from every resident who seems to be a potential fighter after they and Iraqi forces have gained control of the western side of the city.
17483	NYT_ENG_20070619.0208.LDC2009T13	The Americans will also test for the presence of explosive material on suspects' hands.
17484	NYT_ENG_20070622.0083.LDC2009T13	TALES OF JEALOUSY, A THOUSAND YEARS APART
17485	NYT_ENG_20070622.0083.LDC2009T13	Ten Canoes Directed by: Rolf de Heer and Peter Djigirr Written by: de Heer Starring: David Gulpilil, Jamie Gulpilil, Peter Minygululu Running time: 90 minutes Unrated
17486	NYT_ENG_20070622.0083.LDC2009T13	In English and various Yolngu Aboriginal dialects, with subtitles
17487	NYT_ENG_20070622.0083.LDC2009T13	If the ancestral pulp of Mel Gibson's "Apocalypto" seemed too loud, too bloody, or too long, the simple magic-realism of "Ten Canoes" might be preferable.
17488	NYT_ENG_20070622.0083.LDC2009T13	Set among the predominantly nude Yolngu people of northern Australia, the film is about the act of storytelling, and how we expect to be gratified or entertained by it.
17489	NYT_ENG_20070622.0083.LDC2009T13	Played by the veteran Aborigine actor David Gulpilil, who was the star of Nicolas Roeg's "Walkabout" and Philip Noyce's "Rabbit- Proof Fence," an unseen Storyteller draws us back a thousand years to his ancestors, a group of Yolngu men stripping trees of their bark to build canoes for the swamp-bound goose-egg-hunting season.
17490	NYT_ENG_20070622.0083.LDC2009T13	One of the men, a goose-egg rookie named Dayindi (Jamie Gulpilil, David's son), fancies the third and youngest of the three women married to his much older brother, Minygululu (Peter Minygululu).
17491	NYT_ENG_20070622.0083.LDC2009T13	This is a no-no, which requires a tale meant to teach the kid a lesson.
17492	NYT_ENG_20070622.0083.LDC2009T13	For us, it means a trip back even further to hear what happened the last time a Yolngu man coveted his brother's missus.
17493	NYT_ENG_20070622.0083.LDC2009T13	Things are more complicated than that.
17494	NYT_ENG_20070622.0083.LDC2009T13	One man does lust after his brother's youngest wife.
17495	NYT_ENG_20070622.0083.LDC2009T13	But there's also a mysterious stranger who drops in on the tribe (the men deem him a weirdo because he covers his procreative parts with a cloth), and the brother's second wife disappears, sparking a low-key manhunt and speculation that the stranger nabbed her.
17496	NYT_ENG_20070622.0083.LDC2009T13	Duties for telling this fable fall to our Storyteller and Minygululu, whose portion of the film has been shot in black and white.
17497	NYT_ENG_20070622.0083.LDC2009T13	This strategy means the story is being told by two men with an almost jokey indifference to pacing, and so the tale of the stranger and the missing wife starts and stops and begins again, interrupted by the black-and-white scenes of the hunters building their canoes.
17498	NYT_ENG_20070622.0083.LDC2009T13	This should be far more frustrating than it is, although as a filmmaking conceit it's frustrating enough.
17499	NYT_ENG_20070622.0083.LDC2009T13	Yet the codirectors - the Dutch-Australian veteran Rolf de Heer and Peter Djigirr, an Aborigine whose background is in traditional crafts rather than film - go at this movie with a naturalist serenity that's too playful to be completely vexing.

17511	NYT_ENG_20070626.0176.LDC2009T13	NEW YORK - I was lucky enough to find myself here Monday night at the Gerald Loeb awards, the Pulitzers of business journalism.
17512	NYT_ENG_20070626.0176.LDC2009T13	Too bad the Bancrofts of Boston couldn't have been here, too.
17513	NYT_ENG_20070626.0176.LDC2009T13	The family that has controlled The Wall Street Journal for a hundred years is on the brink of selling one of the world's great newspapers - and the most important voice in business journalism - to Rupert Murdoch.
17514	NYT_ENG_20070626.0176.LDC2009T13	The Loebs were a timely and excellent measure of why this quiet New England family has more to lose than to gain in selling to Murdoch, a man who has grown rich and powerful by never overestimating his audience.
17515	NYT_ENG_20070626.0176.LDC2009T13	The Journal, as usual, dominated the Loeb awards this year.
17516	NYT_ENG_20070626.0176.LDC2009T13	In all the newspaper had 10 finalists
17517	NYT_ENG_20070626.0176.LDC2009T13	The New York Times was second with six finalists.
17518	NYT_ENG_20070626.0176.LDC2009T13	The Journal won two Loebs, including one to the Boston-based reporters who broke the story about the wide practice of companies secretly backdating option awards to top executives.
17519	NYT_ENG_20070626.0176.LDC2009T13	It was the story of the year in business, and swept awards, including the Pulitzer Prize.
17520	NYT_ENG_20070626.0176.LDC2009T13	Now Murdoch, at 76, wants to buy what he has not been able to build in a lifetime.

17524	NYT_ENG_20070626.0176.LDC2009T13	But the Bancrofts need to ask themselves: Do they really want to be the generation that sells the Journal to a man whose contribution to American journalism is the New York Post and Fox News?
17525	NYT_ENG_20070626.0176.LDC2009T13	Because that is who they will forever be.
17526	NYT_ENG_20070626.0176.LDC2009T13	And they will be poorer, not richer, for it.
17527	NYT_ENG_20070626.0176.LDC2009T13	Fifteen years ago the Taylor family sold this newspaper to The New York Times Co.
17528	NYT_ENG_20070626.0176.LDC2009T13	Frankly, I liked things the way they were.
17529	NYT_ENG_20070626.0176.LDC2009T13	But if the paper had to be sold, the Taylor family understood it had a duty to find not just a buyer, but a buyer that shared its values.
17530	NYT_ENG_20070626.0176.LDC2009T13	Given the options, Journal editors and writers would be very happy with The New York Times or The Washington Post Co. as a buyer.
17531	NYT_ENG_20070626.0176.LDC2009T13	But it is not going to happen.
17532	NYT_ENG_20070626.0176.LDC2009T13	Plenty of the Journal's best talent is already looking for the exits.

17546	NYT_ENG_20070626.0176.LDC2009T13	The chances of Murdoch improving it are much less than the chances of him compromising it.

17551	NYT_ENG_20070703.0261.LDC2009T13	UTILITIES DUMP COAL PLANT
17552	NYT_ENG_20070703.0261.LDC2009T13	TALLAHASSEE Under pressure from Gov. Charlie Crist, a consortium of Florida utilities pulled the plug Tuesday on another controversial coal-fired power plant because of concerns about global warming.
17553	NYT_ENG_20070703.0261.LDC2009T13	"It's like a new day is dawning for energy in Florida," said Susan Glickman of the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy, which opposed the plant.
17554	NYT_ENG_20070703.0261.LDC2009T13	Crist announced the demise of the coal plant during a news conference unveiling the agenda of his global warming summit in Miami next week, where he promised to "identify specific actions" that Florida can take to combat climate change.
17555	NYT_ENG_20070703.0261.LDC2009T13	"Good things are happening," Crist said.
17556	NYT_ENG_20070703.0261.LDC2009T13	"That pleases me, and I think it pleases our fellow Floridians."
17557	NYT_ENG_20070703.0261.LDC2009T13	Last month the Public Service Commission short-circuited a proposal by Florida Power &amp
17558	NYT_ENG_20070703.0261.LDC2009T13	amp
17559	NYT_ENG_20070703.0261.LDC2009T13	Light to build a 960-megawatt coal-fired plant near Everglades National Park.
17560	NYT_ENG_20070703.0261.LDC2009T13	The PSC based its vote in part on concerns about the cost of cleaning up the plant's greenhouse gas emissions.
17561	NYT_ENG_20070703.0261.LDC2009T13	Now the four utilities involved in building the 800-megawatt Taylor Energy Center in the state's Big Bend area have dropped their plans for that coal plant as well, saying they will "assess how best to meet their customers' electricity needs in ways consistent with growing concerns about greenhouse gas emissions."
17562	NYT_ENG_20070703.0261.LDC2009T13	Utilities officials took that step Tuesday after repeated meetings over the past six months with one of Crist's top aides, Chris Kise, who told them about the governor's concerns regarding greenhouse gas emissions from coal-burning plants.
17563	NYT_ENG_20070703.0261.LDC2009T13	"It's good to encourage good behavior, and I think they've done something very positive," Crist said.
17564	NYT_ENG_20070703.0261.LDC2009T13	After Crist was sworn in as governor in January, he dispatched Kise, whose title is "counsellor to the governor," to meet with FPL executives and the executive director of the consortium involved in the Taylor Energy Center.
17565	NYT_ENG_20070703.0261.LDC2009T13	They talked about global warming.
17566	NYT_ENG_20070703.0261.LDC2009T13	"They got a sense of where the governor's leadership is on the environmental considerations," said Kise, a Miami native who served as solicitor general when Crist was attorney general.
17567	NYT_ENG_20070703.0261.LDC2009T13	The four utilities involved in the Taylor County plant were "very receptive to the governor's message about climate change," Kise said.
17568	NYT_ENG_20070703.0261.LDC2009T13	Taylor project spokesman Mark McCain said Kise didn't tell anyone what to do, but "we shared information about the project and how it compares with other options."
17569	NYT_ENG_20070703.0261.LDC2009T13	As a result, he said, utilities officials realized that "climate change is becoming a major issue in Florida."
17570	NYT_ENG_20070703.0261.LDC2009T13	That point was driven home by last month's decision by the PSC to reject FPL's Glades Power Park plan.
17571	NYT_ENG_20070703.0261.LDC2009T13	FPL officials had announced last September that they would build the plant on about 5,000 acres of Glades County farmland owned by Tampa-based Lykes Brothers.
17572	NYT_ENG_20070703.0261.LDC2009T13	The location would have put the plant within 70 miles of Everglades National Park and 40 miles north of Big Cypress National Preserve.
17573	NYT_ENG_20070703.0261.LDC2009T13	Crist openly questioned the plant's location, the National Park Service raised concerns about air pollution and environmental groups argued it would increase greenhouse gases at a time when the nation is trying to combat global warming.
17574	NYT_ENG_20070703.0261.LDC2009T13	On June 5, PSC commissioners rejected the plant by a 4-0 vote, saying they worried that electric rates could grow much higher for the coal plant if Congress begins taxing carbon emissions as a way to reverse climate change.
17575	NYT_ENG_20070703.0261.LDC2009T13	The vote marked the first time global warming had ever played a role in a PSC decision, and the first time in 15 years the agency rejected a new power plant.
17576	NYT_ENG_20070703.0261.LDC2009T13	So this week the four utilities Tallahassee, the Jacksonville Electric Authority, the Florida Municipal Power Agency and the Disney-based Reedy Creek Improvement District agreed to stop seeking state permits to build the Taylor Energy Center plant near Perry.
17577	NYT_ENG_20070703.0261.LDC2009T13	"It's more important that we work with state leaders to craft an energy plan for Florida," Taylor Energy Center project manager Mike Lawson said in a news release, noting that he looked forward to attending the governor's summit.
17578	NYT_ENG_20070703.0261.LDC2009T13	The announcement marked a startling turnabout for Taylor County residents who opposed the plant.
17579	NYT_ENG_20070703.0261.LDC2009T13	"I'm tickled!"
17580	NYT_ENG_20070703.0261.LDC2009T13	said resident Joy Towles Ezell, who frequently referred to the plant as the "Taylor Emphysema Center."
17581	NYT_ENG_20070703.0261.LDC2009T13	The Taylor plant "was a 19th century solution to a 21st century problem," said Ross Burnaman, a Tallahassee lawyer who had sued to try to stop the plant.
17582	NYT_ENG_20070703.0261.LDC2009T13	"We've got to have power.
17583	NYT_ENG_20070703.0261.LDC2009T13	We know that," Crist said at his news conference.
17584	NYT_ENG_20070703.0261.LDC2009T13	"But to continue to rely on foreign oil and coal, I don't think is in the best interests of our state."
17585	NYT_ENG_20070703.0261.LDC2009T13	Crist's anti-coal crusade isn't over.
17586	NYT_ENG_20070703.0261.LDC2009T13	Last month his Department of Environmental Protection withdrew support for a permit for the Seminole Electric Co. to add onto a coal-burning plant in Putnam County.
17587	NYT_ENG_20070703.0261.LDC2009T13	Because the Putnam plant is an addition to an existing plant, environmental groups had not lined up against it as they did the Everglades and Taylor County plants.
17588	NYT_ENG_20070703.0261.LDC2009T13	It seemed to face smooth sailing.
17589	NYT_ENG_20070703.0261.LDC2009T13	But now the DEP has raised a major hurdle, filing a legal motion that says the state needs to consider limiting the plant's greenhouse gases.
17590	NYT_ENG_20070703.0261.LDC2009T13	Meanwhile the agenda for next week's climate summit calls for discussions of clean energy sources .
17591	NYT_ENG_20070703.0261.LDC2009T13	The conference's cost, estimated at more than $370,000, is being covered by donations from environmental groups and business interests, according to Tom Linley of Volunteer Florida, the agency coordinating the funding.
17592	NYT_ENG_20070703.0261.LDC2009T13	For instance, Walt Disney is giving $10,000
17593	NYT_ENG_20070703.0261.LDC2009T13	General Electric, $20,000
17594	NYT_ENG_20070703.0261.LDC2009T13	and Environmental Defense, $95,000.
17595	NYT_ENG_20070703.0261.LDC2009T13	To environmental activists, it adds up to one thing: Crist is serious about global warming.
17596	NYT_ENG_20070703.0261.LDC2009T13	"The governor has made a fundamental decision that Florida needs to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions, and he's taking a stand that he's not going to allow any new emission sources," Glickman said.
17597	NYT_ENG_20070703.0261.LDC2009T13	"It's the definition of leadership on this issue."

17643	NYT_ENG_20070711.0048.LDC2009T13	Thanks to the gift from Jon and Johnette Jarvis, who own and operate farming and ranching interests in the Texas Panhandle, the university has established an endowment to provide some needy students with rings each year.
17644	NYT_ENG_20070711.0048.LDC2009T13	The gift comes as donors throughout the country are pouring billions into their alma maters to build fancy laboratories and entice top-notch professors and ultra-bright students.
17645	NYT_ENG_20070711.0048.LDC2009T13	The biggest donations usually come with conditions to erect a building or launch a school of study in donors' names.

17653	NYT_ENG_20070711.0048.LDC2009T13	Some want a ring more than a diploma, because they can't carry around the diploma.
17654	NYT_ENG_20070711.0048.LDC2009T13	Every Aggie Ring, which debuted in 1889, is the same except for the class year.
17655	NYT_ENG_20070711.0048.LDC2009T13	On the top of the ring is a large shield, representing the desire to protect the university's reputation.
17656	NYT_ENG_20070711.0048.LDC2009T13	The five stars symbolize the stages of an Aggie's development: intellect, body, spiritual attainment, poise and integrity of character.

17658	NYT_ENG_20070711.0048.LDC2009T13	In recent years, Ring Day has become a spectacle, with students camping outside the alumni center to get their rings.
17659	NYT_ENG_20070711.0048.LDC2009T13	The party afterward involves dunking and then retrieving the ring from something consumable, such as a pitcher of beer or a milkshake.
17660	NYT_ENG_20070711.0048.LDC2009T13	The price tag depends on the price of gold.
17661	NYT_ENG_20070711.0048.LDC2009T13	At the moment, a man's ring is about $700 and a woman's ring is $360, campus officials said.
17662	NYT_ENG_20070711.0048.LDC2009T13	The Jarvis gift will be administered by a student group called Change, which started raising money to help their needy classmates buy rings in 2003.
17663	NYT_ENG_20070711.0048.LDC2009T13	The name reflects its early efforts: asking for spare change, not loose bills, from other students.
17664	NYT_ENG_20070711.0048.LDC2009T13	The club has awarded 55 grants, but found the cupboard was bare at the end of each year.
17665	NYT_ENG_20070711.0048.LDC2009T13	"Unfortunately, asking for change from college students can't sustain a meaningful scholarship program over a long period of time," said Joshua Vernon, the group's director and an engineering student from Houston.
17666	NYT_ENG_20070711.0048.LDC2009T13	"The whole idea of the movement was to create an endowment, but we couldn't do it until the Jarvis gift."
17667	NYT_ENG_20070711.0048.LDC2009T13	The new money should help the group provide as many as 30 rings this year.
17668	NYT_ENG_20070711.0048.LDC2009T13	Without advertising, the group received 30 applications for the four rings to be distributed at the next Ring Day, in September.
17669	NYT_ENG_20070711.0048.LDC2009T13	Applicants must submit a copy of their federal financial aid form to show need and write three essays.
17670	NYT_ENG_20070711.0048.LDC2009T13	The Jarvises will be involved in selecting the recipients.
17671	NYT_ENG_20070711.0048.LDC2009T13	Johnette Jarvis said the idea of providing a permanent source of income for the group intrigued her and her husband.
17672	NYT_ENG_20070711.0048.LDC2009T13	They wear their rings "religiously," she said, especially when traveling.
17673	NYT_ENG_20070711.0048.LDC2009T13	She said she once wore her ring to Israel, where a jeweler grabbed her hand and said: "You're an Aggie!

17695	NYT_ENG_20070716.0094.LDC2009T13	However, bad news on housing and energy could still spark deep sell-offs, and analysts expect the market to swing up and down through the rest of the year.
17696	NYT_ENG_20070716.0094.LDC2009T13	"There are still some rough days ahead," said Jim Swanson, chief investment strategist at MFS Investment Management in Boston.
17697	NYT_ENG_20070716.0094.LDC2009T13	But if anything, this bull market has shown it can weather rough days and come back roaring.
17698	NYT_ENG_20070716.0094.LDC2009T13	It rebounded from a 416-point plunge in February and, more recently, a nearly 200-point drop June 7.
17699	NYT_ENG_20070716.0094.LDC2009T13	"For all the gyrations, the economy is on a moderate growth track," said Stuart Hoffman, chief economist at PNC Financial in Pittsburgh.
17700	NYT_ENG_20070716.0094.LDC2009T13	"I expect the market is heading higher, maybe not another 10 percent, but continuing its two steps forward, one step back" pattern.
17701	NYT_ENG_20070716.0094.LDC2009T13	In addition to strong global growth, the bull market has been sustained by a resilient US economy.
17702	NYT_ENG_20070716.0094.LDC2009T13	After expanding at an anemic 0.7 percent annual rate in the first quarter, the US economy is expected to grow in the second quarter at an annual rate well above 3 percent, according to economists.
17703	NYT_ENG_20070716.0094.LDC2009T13	Employers have been adding an average of 145,000 jobs a month this year, and the jobless rate has slipped to 4.5 percent.
17704	NYT_ENG_20070716.0094.LDC2009T13	Wages are rising, too, supporting consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of economic activity.
17705	NYT_ENG_20070716.0094.LDC2009T13	Meanwhile, inflation remains under control, and interest rates, while higher than a few years ago, remain relatively low.
17706	NYT_ENG_20070716.0094.LDC2009T13	"The market is absorbing the fact that the economy is rebounding," said Nariman Behravesh, chief economist at Global Insight, a Waltham forecasting firm.
17707	NYT_ENG_20070716.0094.LDC2009T13	This week's rally was sparked Thursday when some of the nation's biggest retailers, including Wal-Mart Stores Inc., reported better-than-expected sales in June.
17708	NYT_ENG_20070716.0094.LDC2009T13	Investors viewed those results as a sign consumer spending is solid, despite gasoline prices of about $3 a gallon and falling home values.
17709	NYT_ENG_20070716.0094.LDC2009T13	On Friday, investors were cheered by a Commerce Department report that businesses are rebuilding inventories, which typically boosts manufacturing.
17710	NYT_ENG_20070716.0094.LDC2009T13	The University of Michigan also reported that consumer sentiment improved significantly in early July, viewed as another support for consumer spending.
17711	NYT_ENG_20070716.0094.LDC2009T13	"The market has come to the realization that the consumer is holding up," said Richard Hoyt, market strategist at KDV Wealth Management in Minneapolis.
17712	NYT_ENG_20070716.0094.LDC2009T13	"There are good economic fundamentals, the foremost of which is job growth."
17713	NYT_ENG_20070716.0094.LDC2009T13	Strong global growth, meanwhile, is fueling corporate profits and subsequently stock prices since the biggest US companies have extensive international operations.
17714	NYT_ENG_20070716.0094.LDC2009T13	For example, EMC Corp. of Hopkinton and Genzyme Corp. of Cambridge each generate more than 40 percent of their revenues internationally.

17723	NYT_ENG_20070716.0094.LDC2009T13	That followed 14 consecutive quarters of double-digit profit growth.
17724	NYT_ENG_20070716.0094.LDC2009T13	These consistently strong profits have left corporations awash with cash, which in turn is also helping to boost stock prices.
17725	NYT_ENG_20070716.0094.LDC2009T13	Many corporations have used the money to buy back stock, reducing the number of shares outstanding and increasing values.
17726	NYT_ENG_20070716.0094.LDC2009T13	Some have used the money to acquire other firms, which also can drive up stock prices.
17727	NYT_ENG_20070716.0094.LDC2009T13	Also helping to fuel mergers and acquisitions are global interest rates, which, while rising, remain at attractive levels.

17730	NYT_ENG_20070716.0094.LDC2009T13	Like other analysts, Weiss said he expects the market to swing up and down as it grapples with the housing downturn but ultimately to move higher.
17731	NYT_ENG_20070716.0094.LDC2009T13	"As long as interest rates don't spike on a long-term basis," he said, "the market has some more to go."

17735	NYT_ENG_20070720.0241.LDC2009T13	The European and American sponsors of a resolution that would put Kosovo on the path to independence withdrew the measure from the Security Council on Friday in the face of a promised Russian veto and said a six-nation European group would now seek a way to settle the contentious statehood question.
17736	NYT_ENG_20070720.0241.LDC2009T13	"We regret that it has been impossible to secure such a resolution in the United Nations Security Council," said Jean- Marc de la Sabliere, the French ambassador.
17737	NYT_ENG_20070720.0241.LDC2009T13	"We will therefore put on hold discussions of the resolution."
17738	NYT_ENG_20070720.0241.LDC2009T13	He made the announcement after a morning meeting held to test the ongoing Russian resistance to the resolution despite repeated revisions adopted in recent weeks to try to meet Moscow's objections.
17739	NYT_ENG_20070720.0241.LDC2009T13	Vitaly I. Churkin, the Russian ambassador, said he had told the 15 council ambassadors that Russia was not prepared to vote yes or to abstain, leaving a veto the sure response if a vote were called.
17740	NYT_ENG_20070720.0241.LDC2009T13	Asked beforehand why the sponsors would not allow a vote to go forward and let the Russians cast their veto, Emyr Jones Parry, the British ambassador, said, "We didn't want high drama, which might have had consequences in the region."
17741	NYT_ENG_20070720.0241.LDC2009T13	De la Sabliere said the so-called contact group -- Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Russia and the United States -- would meet on Wednesday in Vienna, Austria, and start a process of talks on Kosovo that would be limited to 120 days.
17742	NYT_ENG_20070720.0241.LDC2009T13	Asked if the sponsors were "abandoning" the Security Council, Zalmay Khalilzad, the American ambassador, said, "The council is blocked."
17743	NYT_ENG_20070720.0241.LDC2009T13	He declined to say whether the issue would return here one day.
17744	NYT_ENG_20070720.0241.LDC2009T13	The resolution was an attempt to provide a managed way to move Kosovo to statehood with protection for the 10 percent Serbian minority and promised membership in the European Union.
17745	NYT_ENG_20070720.0241.LDC2009T13	The original resolution was modeled on a plan for "supervised independence" developed by Martti Ahtisaari, the U.S. envoy who delivered the proposed resolution to the Security Council in March, saying that 13 months of direct negotiations between Belgrade and Pristina has produced an impasse.
17746	NYT_ENG_20070720.0241.LDC2009T13	The series of language changes made since then removed the certainty of an outcome promising independence, but Churkin, the Russian ambassador, held that the measure was still "permeated with independence for Kosovo" and therefore unacceptable.
17747	NYT_ENG_20070720.0241.LDC2009T13	Earlier this week he bluntly portrayed its chance for passage as "zero."

17755	NYT_ENG_20070723.0051.LDC2009T13	It's just like the daytime soaps, with rolling r's.
17756	NYT_ENG_20070723.0051.LDC2009T13	In other words, the word "telenovela" is, in many ways, the definition of mind candy, but not according to the dictionary.
17757	NYT_ENG_20070723.0051.LDC2009T13	The word telenovela is, according to Merriam-Webster, defined as a Latin American soap opera.
17758	NYT_ENG_20070723.0051.LDC2009T13	According to Merriam-Webster's Web site, the collegiate dictionary is updated yearly with a list of new "words, senses and variants."

17765	NYT_ENG_20070723.0051.LDC2009T13	Here's what this means: the parameters of the English language stretch a little at a time to make room for new words -- such as IED, perfect storm and smackdown -- that make their way into American conversations in ENGLISH.

17776	NYT_ENG_20070802.0092.LDC2009T13	Cox News Service
17777	NYT_ENG_20070802.0092.LDC2009T13	WASHINGTON - Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich said Thursday the Bush administration is waging a "phony war" on terrorism, warning that the country is losing ground against the kind of Islamic radicals who attacked the country on Sept. 11, 2001.
17778	NYT_ENG_20070802.0092.LDC2009T13	A more effective approach, said Gingrich, would begin with a national energy strategy aimed at weening the country from its reliance on imported oil and some of the regimes that petrodollars support.
17779	NYT_ENG_20070802.0092.LDC2009T13	"None of you should believe we are winning this war.
17780	NYT_ENG_20070802.0092.LDC2009T13	There is no evidence that we are winning this war," the Georgia Republican told a group of about 300 students attending a conference for collegiate conservatives.
17781	NYT_ENG_20070802.0092.LDC2009T13	Gingrich, who led the so-called Republican Revolution that won the GOP control of both houses of Congress in 1994 midterm elections, said more must be done to marshal national resources to combat Islamic militants at home and abroad and to prepare the country for future attack.
17782	NYT_ENG_20070802.0092.LDC2009T13	He was unstinting in his criticism of his fellow Republicans, in the White House and on Capitol Hill.
17783	NYT_ENG_20070802.0092.LDC2009T13	"We were in charge for six years," he said, referring to the period between 2001 and early 2007, when the GOP controlled the White House and both houses of Congress.
17784	NYT_ENG_20070802.0092.LDC2009T13	"I don't think you can look and say that was a great success."
17785	NYT_ENG_20070802.0092.LDC2009T13	Said Gingrich, "Look at New Orleans, how can you say New Orleans is succeeding?
17786	NYT_ENG_20070802.0092.LDC2009T13	Look at Baghdad.
17787	NYT_ENG_20070802.0092.LDC2009T13	If you can't look failure in the face how do you improve it?"
17788	NYT_ENG_20070802.0092.LDC2009T13	Thursday's National Conservative Student Conference was sponsored by the Young America's Foundation, a Herndon, Va.-based group founded in the 1960s as a political counterpoint to the left- leaning activists that coalesced around the civil rights movement and opposition to the Vietnam War.
17789	NYT_ENG_20070802.0092.LDC2009T13	Gingrich retains strong support among conservatives and ranked fifth among possible Republican nominees, behind former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, with the backing of 7 percent of those queried in a ABC News/Washington Post poll taken last week.

17801	NYT_ENG_20070802.0092.LDC2009T13	While keeping an arm's length from overt presidential politicking, Gingrich has been promoting a weekly political newsletter he calls "Winning the Future."
17802	NYT_ENG_20070802.0092.LDC2009T13	It's available free to those who will leave their e-mail address at U_R_L one of several Web sites he's connected with or operating.
17803	NYT_ENG_20070802.0092.LDC2009T13	Gingrich began writing the newsletter in April, 2006, and it now goes out to 311,000 readers each week, said Gingrich spokesman Rick Tyler.
17804	NYT_ENG_20070802.0092.LDC2009T13	At another Web site - www.americansolutions.com - Gingrich is running a virtual political salon, with video clips, organizational information and contacts revolving around his conservative vision for the country's future.
17805	NYT_ENG_20070802.0092.LDC2009T13	At that site, Gingrich asks supporters to join in an Internet "Solutions Day" on Sept. 27, the anniversary of his so-called "Contract With America," a slate of conservative policies he led through Congress as Speaker of the House a decade and a half ago.
17806	NYT_ENG_20070802.0092.LDC2009T13	"What I'm trying to start is a new dialogue that is evidence- based," Gingrich said Thursday.
17807	NYT_ENG_20070802.0092.LDC2009T13	"It doesn't start from the right wing, it doesn't start from the left wing," he said, but is an effort to get politicians and voters to "look honestly at the evidence of what isn't working and tell us how to change it."
17808	NYT_ENG_20070802.0092.LDC2009T13	Gingrich was interrupted with applause once, when he called for an end to the biting partisanship critics claim has polarized national politics and paralyzed the workings of government.
17809	NYT_ENG_20070802.0092.LDC2009T13	"We have got to get past this partisan baloney, where I'm not allowed to say anything good about Hillary Clinton because 'I'm not a loyal Republican,' and she's not allowed to say anything good about me, or she's not a 'loyal' Democrat.
17810	NYT_ENG_20070802.0092.LDC2009T13	What a stupid way to run a country."
17811	NYT_ENG_20070802.0092.LDC2009T13	He reserved his most pointed criticism, though, for the administration's handling of the global campaign against terrorist groups.
17812	NYT_ENG_20070802.0092.LDC2009T13	"We've been engaged in a phony war," said Gingrich.
17813	NYT_ENG_20070802.0092.LDC2009T13	"The only people who have been taking this seriously are the combat military."
17814	NYT_ENG_20070802.0092.LDC2009T13	His remarks seemed to reflect, in part, the findings of a National Intelligence Estimate made public last month.
17815	NYT_ENG_20070802.0092.LDC2009T13	In the estimate, the U.S. intelligence community concluded that six years of U.S. efforts to degrade the al-Qaida terrorist group had left the organization constrained but still potent, having "protected or regenerated" the capability to attack the United States in ways that have left the country "in a heightened threat environment."
17816	NYT_ENG_20070802.0092.LDC2009T13	"We have to take this seriously," said Gingrich.
17817	NYT_ENG_20070802.0092.LDC2009T13	"We used to be a serious country.
17818	NYT_ENG_20070802.0092.LDC2009T13	When we got attacked at Pearl Harbor, we took on Imperial Japan, Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany," he said, referring to World War II.
17819	NYT_ENG_20070802.0092.LDC2009T13	"We beat all three in less than four years.

17824	NYT_ENG_20070802.0092.LDC2009T13	Gingrich said he would lay out in a Sept. 10 speech what a successful U.S. approach to this threat would have looked like over the past six years.
17825	NYT_ENG_20070802.0092.LDC2009T13	"First of all, we have to have a national energy strategy, which basically says to the Saudis, 'We're not going to rely on you,"' Gingrich said.
17826	NYT_ENG_20070802.0092.LDC2009T13	The United States imports about 14 million barrels of oil a day, making up two-thirds of its total consumption.
17827	NYT_ENG_20070802.0092.LDC2009T13	Saudi Arabia is roughly tied with Venezuela as this country's largest source of foreign oil.
17828	NYT_ENG_20070802.0092.LDC2009T13	Each country supplies about 1.5 million barrels of oil a day to the United States, or about 7 percent of the country's total supply.
17829	NYT_ENG_20070802.0092.LDC2009T13	President Bush has called for reducing U.S. gasoline consumption by 20 percent over the coming decade, in part by improving fuel efficiency for cars and trucks.
17830	NYT_ENG_20070802.0092.LDC2009T13	In addition, the administration and Congress have spent or allocated $15 billion to develop new energy technologies and he has called for legislation aimed at increasing domestic oil production.
17831	NYT_ENG_20070802.0092.LDC2009T13	Next, he said, the United States should be doing everything it can to support reform-oriented activists in Iran, where Gingrich sees a crackdown on dissent as a sign of vulnerability.
17832	NYT_ENG_20070802.0092.LDC2009T13	The Bush administration is spending $75 million this year to help support reformists in Iran - by transmitting radio and television programs into the country, running cultural exchange programs and other activities.
17833	NYT_ENG_20070802.0092.LDC2009T13	The program has run up against push back from some quarters for allegedly being too assertive, with critics alleging that some of the beamed-in broadcasts have the ring of propaganda and that by being overly involved in Iran's internal politics the United States runs the risk of making Iranian reformists appear to be pro-American in ways that are counterproductive within Iran.
17834	NYT_ENG_20070802.0092.LDC2009T13	"This is a dictatorship in crisis," he said of Iran, which U.S. military officials accuse of providing armor-piercing weapons that have killed American forces in neighboring Iraq.
17835	NYT_ENG_20070802.0092.LDC2009T13	Citing Iran's heavy reliance on imports of gasoline and other refined petroleum products, Gingrich said, "I would have a very active plan to sabotage the refineries in Iran, and I'd say, 'You want to send rockets to Iraq, fine, you'll have to carry them by ox cart."

17837	NYT_ENG_20070804.0058.LDC2009T13	DRAWING FIRE, JUDITH GIULIANI GIVES HER SIDE
17838	NYT_ENG_20070804.0058.LDC2009T13	It has not been an easy few months for Judith Giuliani.
17839	NYT_ENG_20070804.0058.LDC2009T13	Her rollout to the public received rocky reviews from the political class, Republicans included.
17840	NYT_ENG_20070804.0058.LDC2009T13	A series of negative articles about her shopping habits, marital past and supposedly testy relations with campaign staff followed.
17841	NYT_ENG_20070804.0058.LDC2009T13	Her appearances alongside her husband, Rudolph W. Giuliani, grew suddenly scarce -- and some analysts suggested that she keep it that way.
17842	NYT_ENG_20070804.0058.LDC2009T13	So it was perhaps no surprise that at a recent lunch in downtown Manhattan, Judith offered this self-assessment: "When it comes to politics, I'm new to this."
17843	NYT_ENG_20070804.0058.LDC2009T13	Over the course of a two-hour interview, Judith Giuliani, 53, talked for the first time about how she met Rudolph Giuliani and about their first date.
17844	NYT_ENG_20070804.0058.LDC2009T13	(He asked her out, she said.)
17845	NYT_ENG_20070804.0058.LDC2009T13	But she returned again and again to her inexperience as a political wife, saying, "It's a learning curve for me."
17846	NYT_ENG_20070804.0058.LDC2009T13	"I'm sure that's something that can get one into, you know -- " She did not finish the thought, but allowed her hands to flutter cautiously before going on.
17847	NYT_ENG_20070804.0058.LDC2009T13	"But I try to remain me.
17848	NYT_ENG_20070804.0058.LDC2009T13	And again, part of that is not doing anything more than I have to in terms of making myself in any way a distraction from what my husband is trying to do for America."
17849	NYT_ENG_20070804.0058.LDC2009T13	Not becoming a distraction to her husband, a front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination, appears to be an elusive goal.
17850	NYT_ENG_20070804.0058.LDC2009T13	A daughter of small-town Pennsylvania, a former nurse and working mother who struggled to raise a child on her own, she cuts a figure that Rudolph Giuliani's aides say will appeal to Republican voters.
17851	NYT_ENG_20070804.0058.LDC2009T13	Husband and wife agree that Laura Bush is a model for Judith Giuliani.
17852	NYT_ENG_20070804.0058.LDC2009T13	But Judith Giuliani carries some distinctly un-Laura baggage.
17853	NYT_ENG_20070804.0058.LDC2009T13	Like her husband, she has been married twice before.
17854	NYT_ENG_20070804.0058.LDC2009T13	They also had a secret affair for a year before Rudolph Giuliani announced it to the world -- and to his second wife, Donna Hanover -- at a news conference.
17855	NYT_ENG_20070804.0058.LDC2009T13	Her relations with Rudolph Giuliani's children by Hanover are by all accounts deeply strained, despite her efforts at rapprochement.
17856	NYT_ENG_20070804.0058.LDC2009T13	And his son and daughter, ages 21 and 17, have said they do not plan to campaign for their father.
17857	NYT_ENG_20070804.0058.LDC2009T13	Sharply critical articles, most recently in Vanity Fair, have described Judith Giuliani as an imperious striver who shops extravagantly, demands a separate seat on the campaign plane for her Louis Vuitton handbag and has compiled a hit list of campaign aides she wants fired.
17858	NYT_ENG_20070804.0058.LDC2009T13	Now, with his wife's public role scaled back, at least temporarily, strategists are asking dueling questions: Can he win over socially conservative voters if his wife is not by his side?
17859	NYT_ENG_20070804.0058.LDC2009T13	Can he win them over if she is?
17860	NYT_ENG_20070804.0058.LDC2009T13	To Judith Giuliani's husband and friends, the scrutiny and criticism have been quite unfair.
17861	NYT_ENG_20070804.0058.LDC2009T13	And largely in response to the spate of bad press, both Rudolph Giuliani and his wife made themselves available in recent weeks to present their side of her story.
17862	NYT_ENG_20070804.0058.LDC2009T13	In coordinated but separate interviews, the couple talked in detail for the first time in months about their relationship and the complications it poses for his campaign.
17863	NYT_ENG_20070804.0058.LDC2009T13	In one of his interviews, Rudolph Giuliani acknowledged that his wife was a political neophyte whose background has "not been every day having a press conference."
17864	NYT_ENG_20070804.0058.LDC2009T13	But he described her as an effective fundraiser and trusted sounding board for his policies, particularly on health care, because she holds a two-year nursing degree and once sold pharmaceuticals.
17865	NYT_ENG_20070804.0058.LDC2009T13	(He praised her mastery of "the way a surgical procedure is done or the way in which you seal a Level 1 trauma center off for a biological agent.")
17866	NYT_ENG_20070804.0058.LDC2009T13	He also said she has good relations with people inside his campaign, and he rejected descriptions of his wife as high-handed or high society.
17867	NYT_ENG_20070804.0058.LDC2009T13	"Judith loves to go out and loves to be with people," he said.
17868	NYT_ENG_20070804.0058.LDC2009T13	"But she is not one of those people that constantly has to socialize."
17869	NYT_ENG_20070804.0058.LDC2009T13	While Rudolph Giuliani stopped short of saying he would invite her to Cabinet meetings -- as he told Barbara Walters on "20/20" in March -- he said she does attend "about a quarter" of the campaign's political discussions and advises him on major personnel matters because she has "great instincts for being able to judge people."
17870	NYT_ENG_20070804.0058.LDC2009T13	She participated, for instance, in her husband's interview with Michael DuHaime for the position of campaign manager.
17871	NYT_ENG_20070804.0058.LDC2009T13	And she concurred with the decision to hire him, Rudolph Giuliani said.
17872	NYT_ENG_20070804.0058.LDC2009T13	"She's involved, but she's not overly involved," he said.
17873	NYT_ENG_20070804.0058.LDC2009T13	"She's usually involved when I ask her to be -- and in things that she has an interest in."
17874	NYT_ENG_20070804.0058.LDC2009T13	But when asked how visible he expects his wife to be on the campaign trail, Rudolph Giuliani hesitated, then managed a noncommittal reply.
17875	NYT_ENG_20070804.0058.LDC2009T13	"I'd say reasonably visible?"
17876	NYT_ENG_20070804.0058.LDC2009T13	he said.
17877	NYT_ENG_20070804.0058.LDC2009T13	(END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
17878	NYT_ENG_20070804.0058.LDC2009T13	Judith Nathan became a part of Rudolph Giuliani's life in 1999, not long before his prostate cancer was diagnosed.
17879	NYT_ENG_20070804.0058.LDC2009T13	The circumstances of their meeting have been the subject of much contention, with some critics suggesting that she aggressively pursued him at a time when he was New York City's mayor and still living in Gracie Mansion with Hanover and their children.
17880	NYT_ENG_20070804.0058.LDC2009T13	Until now, the Giulianis have declined to discuss the matter, calling it "a romantic secret."
17881	NYT_ENG_20070804.0058.LDC2009T13	But in the interviews, the couple provided their version of their introduction, saying they met at Club Macanudo, a cigar bar on E. 63rd Street, in May 1999.
17882	NYT_ENG_20070804.0058.LDC2009T13	They said they were introduced by Burt Meyers, a specialist in infectious diseases at Mount Sinai Hospital who was there with Nathan and had met Rudolph Giuliani when his mother was a patient there.
17883	NYT_ENG_20070804.0058.LDC2009T13	After chatting for an hour, mostly about her work in the pharmaceutical industry, Rudolph Giuliani asked for her phone number, they said.
17884	NYT_ENG_20070804.0058.LDC2009T13	"She gave me a piece of paper to write it on," he recalled.
17885	NYT_ENG_20070804.0058.LDC2009T13	"One of our other romantic little secrets is I've kept it all these years in my wallet."
17886	NYT_ENG_20070804.0058.LDC2009T13	After they began dating, Judith Giuliani had plans to fly to Hawaii on a vacation awarded to leading sales managers by her employer.
17887	NYT_ENG_20070804.0058.LDC2009T13	"He said, 'Please don't go,"' she recalled. "
17888	NYT_ENG_20070804.0058.LDC2009T13	'You've already become too important to me."'
17889	NYT_ENG_20070804.0058.LDC2009T13	Judith Giuliani declined to comment when asked how she felt about dating a married man, or the complications involved in seeing him secretly.
17890	NYT_ENG_20070804.0058.LDC2009T13	Rudolph Giuliani said: "I don't discuss that in detail except to say that, you know, we love each other very much, and we have both found the person that we adore and can live with the rest of our lives.
17891	NYT_ENG_20070804.0058.LDC2009T13	It didn't happen for either of us young in life."
17892	NYT_ENG_20070804.0058.LDC2009T13	Through her spokeswoman, Hanover, Rudolph Giuliani's ex-wife, declined to comment for this article.
17893	NYT_ENG_20070804.0058.LDC2009T13	Judith Giuliani grew up as Judi Stish in Hazleton, Pa., a coal- mining town, the second of three children.
17894	NYT_ENG_20070804.0058.LDC2009T13	Her father, whose forebears came from Italy -- the family's name had been Sticia -- was a circulation manager for The Philadelphia Inquirer.
17895	NYT_ENG_20070804.0058.LDC2009T13	After she graduated from St. Luke's School of Nursing in Bethlehem, Pa., she worked for several months as a hospital nurse, then took a sales job for U.S. Surgical, a medical equipment company, where her first husband, Jeffrey Ross, also worked.
17896	NYT_ENG_20070804.0058.LDC2009T13	Judith Giuliani's second husband, Bruce Nathan, was a wallpaper salesman from Long Island.
17897	NYT_ENG_20070804.0058.LDC2009T13	They adopted a girl, Whitney, lived in Atlanta, Manhattan and Southern California, and split bitterly in 1992.
17898	NYT_ENG_20070804.0058.LDC2009T13	She returned with their daughter to Manhattan, took computer and business classes at night at New York University and eventually moved into the cramped East Side apartment of a psychologist she was dating, Manos Zacharioudakis.
17899	NYT_ENG_20070804.0058.LDC2009T13	Sometimes, when she could not find a baby sitter, she took her daughter to class.
17900	NYT_ENG_20070804.0058.LDC2009T13	The experience, she said, helped her understand the struggles of working women and single mothers.
17901	NYT_ENG_20070804.0058.LDC2009T13	From 1993 until 2001, she worked her way up in the hospital sales division of Bristol-Myers Squibb.
17902	NYT_ENG_20070804.0058.LDC2009T13	The Giulianis were married by Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg in May 2003, on the lawn of Gracie Mansion.
17903	NYT_ENG_20070804.0058.LDC2009T13	Among their 400 guests were Henry A. Kissinger, Yogi Berra, Vera Wang, and Joseph Volpe, the general manager of the Metropolitan Opera.
17904	NYT_ENG_20070804.0058.LDC2009T13	Judith Giuliani's initial period of involvement in her husband's campaign -- she called it "being rolled out publicly"-- began with a couple of gentle, staged events in the spring.
17905	NYT_ENG_20070804.0058.LDC2009T13	She was profiled in the March issue of Harper's Bazaar and photographed wearing a Ralph Lauren Collection jacket, a Celine dress and Graff diamonds.
17906	NYT_ENG_20070804.0058.LDC2009T13	(A caption read, "Judith Giuliani epitomizes laid-back elegance.")
17907	NYT_ENG_20070804.0058.LDC2009T13	In late March, she and Rudolph Giuliani clasped hands and kissed throughout their interview with Walters, in which the former mayor said that "to the extent she wants to be," his wife would be involved in policy decisions and could sit in on Cabinet meetings.
17908	NYT_ENG_20070804.0058.LDC2009T13	His comment drew derision from those who said she lacked the expertise to attend high-level policy meetings, and the remark overshadowed the rest of the interview.
17909	NYT_ENG_20070804.0058.LDC2009T13	The rollout rolled downhill from there.
17910	NYT_ENG_20070804.0058.LDC2009T13	The New York Daily News discovered that Judith Giuliani had been married twice before -- not once, as had been generally believed.
17911	NYT_ENG_20070804.0058.LDC2009T13	The New York Times reported that Rudolph Giuliani had become estranged from his children and that Judith Giuliani was, in large part, the reason.
17912	NYT_ENG_20070804.0058.LDC2009T13	A March 14 clip of Judith Giuliani going on at length about her own credentials as she introduced her husband at a fundraiser began circulating on YouTube.
17913	NYT_ENG_20070804.0058.LDC2009T13	And on April 2, The New York Post reported that sales workers at Judith Giuliani's old employer, U.S. Surgical, often demonstrated staplers on dogs that were subsequently put to death.
17914	NYT_ENG_20070804.0058.LDC2009T13	Although Judith Giuliani's friends say the coverage has been painful, the Giulianis tried to brush off the difficulties.
17915	NYT_ENG_20070804.0058.LDC2009T13	"I don't want to sit in on Cabinet meetings," Judith Giuliani said.
17916	NYT_ENG_20070804.0058.LDC2009T13	"He offered me that because he loves me.
17917	NYT_ENG_20070804.0058.LDC2009T13	You know, he says he respects my intelligence."
17918	NYT_ENG_20070804.0058.LDC2009T13	But she remains uncomfortable talking about his campaign.
17919	NYT_ENG_20070804.0058.LDC2009T13	In the interview, she grew most animated when talking about golfing with Rudolph Giuliani -- she plays, on average, about a stroke below him -- and medical subjects.
17920	NYT_ENG_20070804.0058.LDC2009T13	"I'm really happy to talk to you about staphylococcus and streptococcus," she said.
17921	NYT_ENG_20070804.0058.LDC2009T13	Rudolph Giuliani called her the "rookie of the year" as a candidate spouse.
17922	NYT_ENG_20070804.0058.LDC2009T13	But he candidly acknowledged that his, and her, complicated marital resumes might be liabilities among some Republican voters.
17923	NYT_ENG_20070804.0058.LDC2009T13	"Any candidate that's lived a long life is going to have made a certain number of mistakes," he said.
17924	NYT_ENG_20070804.0058.LDC2009T13	"For some people, this'll make it difficult, if not impossible, for them to vote for me."

17926	NYT_ENG_20070831.0208.LDC2009T13	CAMP PENDLETON, Calif.
17927	NYT_ENG_20070831.0208.LDC2009T13	A Marine sergeant offered gruesome testimony on Friday against a former squad leader charged with killing 17 Iraqi civilians in Haditha nearly two years ago, suggesting that the defendant, Staff Sgt. Frank D. Wuterich, was predisposed to the violence, carried it out ruthlessly and sought to cover it up.
17928	NYT_ENG_20070831.0208.LDC2009T13	The prosecution witness, Sgt. Sanick Dela Cruz, was ordered to testify with immunity after murder charges against him for killing five of the men were dismissed in April.
17929	NYT_ENG_20070831.0208.LDC2009T13	At the hearing, to determine whether the charges against Wuterich should progress to a court-martial, Dela Cruz testified that Wuterich shot five unarmed men as they stood behind a car, some with their hands interlocked behind their heads in a surrender posture, in the moments after the bomb exploded.
17930	NYT_ENG_20070831.0208.LDC2009T13	He also said Wuterich fired more rounds into the bodies of all five men as they lay dead or dying near a car a short distance from the attack.
17931	NYT_ENG_20070831.0208.LDC2009T13	Wuterich has said he shot the five men, but only after they ran away, which he believed constituted a hostile act that allowed him to use deadly force.
17932	NYT_ENG_20070831.0208.LDC2009T13	Dela Cruz told prosecutors that a week before the Haditha episode, Wuterich had reacted to an earlier roadside bombing by telling him and other Marines in the unit, "If we ever get hit again, we should kill everybody in that area."

17934	NYT_ENG_20070901.0025.LDC2009T13	SAN DIEGO
17935	NYT_ENG_20070901.0025.LDC2009T13	Dodgers pitcher Randy Wolf's last-ditch effort to return from the disabled list before the end of the season has been snuffed out by another setback.
17936	NYT_ENG_20070901.0025.LDC2009T13	The left-hander felt more discomfort in his shoulder this week and will undergo arthroscopic surgery Wednesday at the Kerlan- Jobe clinic to determine the cause.
17937	NYT_ENG_20070901.0025.LDC2009T13	The development casts Wolf's future into doubt, especially given that he spurned a handful of multi-year offers last winter to accept a one-year contract with his hometown Dodgers.
17938	NYT_ENG_20070901.0025.LDC2009T13	"Obviously, I took a huge risk to come here," Wolf said.
17939	NYT_ENG_20070901.0025.LDC2009T13	"I knew it was a risk, but I took a gamble, and I lost.
17940	NYT_ENG_20070901.0025.LDC2009T13	Life is full of them."
17941	NYT_ENG_20070901.0025.LDC2009T13	The Dodgers hold a $9 million option on Wolf for next season that they clearly aren't going to exercise, which will leave him in the unenviable position of being a free agent after a season in which injury prevented him from pitching after the All-Star break.
17942	NYT_ENG_20070901.0025.LDC2009T13	But Wolf also is a veteran lefty with a proven track record, so there is a strong chance some team -- perhaps even the Dodgers -- will take a chance on him at a much lower price.
17943	NYT_ENG_20070901.0025.LDC2009T13	"I really have no idea," Wolf said.
17944	NYT_ENG_20070901.0025.LDC2009T13	"I'm in unchartered waters."
17945	NYT_ENG_20070901.0025.LDC2009T13	Wolf had reconstructive elbow surgery two seasons ago, but proved he was healthy last summer when he came back and pitched well in 12 starts for Philadelphia.
17946	NYT_ENG_20070901.0025.LDC2009T13	But before he had that surgery, he had undergone an MRI exam that failed to show the need for it, so for a while he tried to pitch through his elbow discomfort.
17947	NYT_ENG_20070901.0025.LDC2009T13	Wolf speculated that his current shoulder injury might be the result of a mechanical change he made to accommodate the elbow pain before it was discovered that he would need Tommy John surgery.
17948	NYT_ENG_20070901.0025.LDC2009T13	If doctors Lewis Yocum and Neal ElAttrache find the cause of Wolf's discomfort, they will repair it immediately.
17949	NYT_ENG_20070901.0025.LDC2009T13	But no prognosis for Wolf's return to the mound will be known until after the surgery.
17950	NYT_ENG_20070901.0025.LDC2009T13	"If it's only an impingement, which we think it is, he'll be down six to eight weeks," Dodgers trainer Stan Conte said.
17951	NYT_ENG_20070901.0025.LDC2009T13	Wolf was less optimistic.
17952	NYT_ENG_20070901.0025.LDC2009T13	"If they find nothing, I'll be surprised," he said.
17953	NYT_ENG_20070901.0025.LDC2009T13	"It's just too weird.
17954	NYT_ENG_20070901.0025.LDC2009T13	I haven't thrown (off a mound) in four weeks, and it still isn't right.
17955	NYT_ENG_20070901.0025.LDC2009T13	Usually you feel better after four weeks of not throwing."
17956	NYT_ENG_20070901.0025.LDC2009T13	Getting close: Dodgers manager Grady Little said that although Nomar Garciaparra (strained left calf) still hasn't felt good enough to try running, he has looked good enough in batting practice that he might be activated for pinch-hitting purposes as soon as today, when active rosters can be expanded to as many as 40 players.
17957	NYT_ENG_20070901.0025.LDC2009T13	"He really looks good swinging the bat and fielding ground balls, too," Little said.
17958	NYT_ENG_20070901.0025.LDC2009T13	"But he still feels a little something in there (running), and we don't want to push it until he feels comfortable."
17959	NYT_ENG_20070901.0025.LDC2009T13	Also: Newly acquired right-hander Esteban Loaiza will make his Dodgers debut on Monday at Chicago, with Brad Penny starting on Tuesday night against the Cubs and the rest of the rotation staying in order thereafter.
17960	NYT_ENG_20070901.0025.LDC2009T13	... Lefty Eric Stults was optioned to Triple-A Las Vegas to clear a roster spot for Loaiza, but Stults is expected to return to the majors after the 51s' season concludes Monday.
17961	NYT_ENG_20070901.0025.LDC2009T13	... The Dodgers are expected to promote some players from Las Vegas today and some more on Monday.
17962	NYT_ENG_20070901.0025.LDC2009T13	If Double-A Jacksonville reaches the Southern Leaue playoffs, none of the Suns' players will be promoted until their season ends.

17964	NYT_ENG_20070909.0165.LDC2009T13	LEMONT, Ill.
17965	NYT_ENG_20070909.0165.LDC2009T13	Three days and several hours after the BMW Championship began with lackluster crowds and soggy weather, it finished with near perfection.
17966	NYT_ENG_20070909.0165.LDC2009T13	Cog Hill channeled its past, finding a summer climate, typical Chicago galleries and a familiar champion.
17967	NYT_ENG_20070909.0165.LDC2009T13	Tiger Woods, a three-time winner of the Western Open here who finished the previous two in second place, made few mistakes on Sunday on his way to a two-stroke victory in the third FedEx Cup playoff event.
17968	NYT_ENG_20070909.0165.LDC2009T13	He shot a final-round 8-under-par 63, getting him to 22-under for the tournament.
17969	NYT_ENG_20070909.0165.LDC2009T13	"Starting off the day, I thought 20-under-par was going to be the number," Woods said.
17970	NYT_ENG_20070909.0165.LDC2009T13	"But that had to be altered.
17971	NYT_ENG_20070909.0165.LDC2009T13	I figured if I got it to 21, I'd be assured of at least getting into a playoff."
17972	NYT_ENG_20070909.0165.LDC2009T13	On Cog Hill's Dubsdread course, a layout Woods has said he enjoys, he won his 60th PGA Tour event, putting him two shy of Arnold Palmer on the career list.
17973	NYT_ENG_20070909.0165.LDC2009T13	The Tour Championship next week in Atlanta will determine the winner of the inaugural FedEx Cup and its $10 million prize.
17974	NYT_ENG_20070909.0165.LDC2009T13	Woods now leads the FedEx Cup race in points.
17975	NYT_ENG_20070909.0165.LDC2009T13	Phil Mickelson, who entered last week in first but skipped the BMW Championship, fell to third.
17976	NYT_ENG_20070909.0165.LDC2009T13	Woods began Sunday one stroke behind the third-round co-leaders, Steve Stricker and Aaron Baddeley.
17977	NYT_ENG_20070909.0165.LDC2009T13	But by the time Stricker, Baddeley and Woods were through the eighth hole, all three were tied at 17-under.
17978	NYT_ENG_20070909.0165.LDC2009T13	There were points when the three were tied at 18-under and 19-under.
17979	NYT_ENG_20070909.0165.LDC2009T13	"Normally, you don't have to make this many birdies," Woods said.
17980	NYT_ENG_20070909.0165.LDC2009T13	"But with conditions this soft, the guys are just going to tear this place apart.
17981	NYT_ENG_20070909.0165.LDC2009T13	I think the three of us just got wrapped up in it.
17982	NYT_ENG_20070909.0165.LDC2009T13	We were all making birdies, and we kept pushing each other."
17983	NYT_ENG_20070909.0165.LDC2009T13	Woods finished with four birdies on the front nine and four on the back nine.
17984	NYT_ENG_20070909.0165.LDC2009T13	Once he got to 20-under with a birdie at No. 13, nobody could reach him.
17985	NYT_ENG_20070909.0165.LDC2009T13	"At that point, playing catch-up to Tiger is tough to do," Stricker said.
17986	NYT_ENG_20070909.0165.LDC2009T13	Stricker, the Madison, Wis., resident and an All-American at Illinois, served as the week's underdog story with a local twist.
17987	NYT_ENG_20070909.0165.LDC2009T13	But he came up short on the back nine, finishing the tournament in third place at 18-under after a fourth-round 68.
17988	NYT_ENG_20070909.0165.LDC2009T13	Stricker is in second place in the standings.
17989	NYT_ENG_20070909.0165.LDC2009T13	He will begin the Tour Championship in the same group as Woods, which also happened last week.
17990	NYT_ENG_20070909.0165.LDC2009T13	"The first couple of rounds playing with Tiger was very rewarding for me," Stricker said.
17991	NYT_ENG_20070909.0165.LDC2009T13	"I learned a lot.
17992	NYT_ENG_20070909.0165.LDC2009T13	I learned how to deal with being in his group.
17993	NYT_ENG_20070909.0165.LDC2009T13	I felt comfortable with that."
17994	NYT_ENG_20070909.0165.LDC2009T13	Baddeley, 26, quietly continued a strong season, shooting a final-round 66 to reach 20-under 264, a figure that could have won almost any other year at Cog Hill.
17995	NYT_ENG_20070909.0165.LDC2009T13	But Woods finished with a 262, a record 72-hole total for the tournament.
17996	NYT_ENG_20070909.0165.LDC2009T13	"Steve and I sort of both made him do that, because we were both playing well," Baddeley said.
17997	NYT_ENG_20070909.0165.LDC2009T13	"And he just made a couple extra birdies at the finish there to get by us."
17998	NYT_ENG_20070909.0165.LDC2009T13	After 17 straight years of having the Western Open and then BMW Championship at Cog Hill, the tournament will move to Bellerive Country Club in St. Louis next year.
17999	NYT_ENG_20070909.0165.LDC2009T13	It was only appropriate that Woods won this edition of the tournament, where he received an exemption as an amateur and made his first Tour cut.
18000	NYT_ENG_20070909.0165.LDC2009T13	"I've always just loved playing here," Woods said.

18003	NYT_ENG_20070921.0187.LDC2009T13	Walid Jawad was tired of all the chatter on Middle Eastern blogs and Internet forums in praise of gory attacks carried out by the "noble resistance" in Iraq.
18004	NYT_ENG_20070921.0187.LDC2009T13	So Jawad, one of two Arabic-language bloggers for the State Department, posted his own question: Why was it that many in the Arab World quickly condemned civilian Palestinian deaths but were mute about the endless killing of women and children by suicide bombers in Iraq?
18005	NYT_ENG_20070921.0187.LDC2009T13	Among those who responded was a man named Radad, evidently a Sunni Muslim, who wrote that many of the dead in Iraq were just Shiites and describing them in derogatory terms.
18006	NYT_ENG_20070921.0187.LDC2009T13	But others who answered Jawad said that they, too, wondered why only Palestinian dead were "martyrs."
18007	NYT_ENG_20070921.0187.LDC2009T13	The discussion tacked back and forth for four days, one of many such conversations prompted by scores of postings the State Department has made on about 70 Web sites since it put its two Arab-American bloggers to work last November.
18008	NYT_ENG_20070921.0187.LDC2009T13	The blogging, officially known as the Digital Outreach Team, is an attempt to take a more casual, varied approach to improving America's image in the Arab World.
18009	NYT_ENG_20070921.0187.LDC2009T13	Brent E. Blaschke, the project director, said the idea is to reach "swing voters," whom he described as the silent majority of Muslims who might sympathize with al-Qaida yet be open to information about U.S. government policy and American values.
18010	NYT_ENG_20070921.0187.LDC2009T13	The department expects to add seven more bloggers within the next month -- four more in Arabic, two in Farsi and one in Urdu, the official language of Pakistan.
18011	NYT_ENG_20070921.0187.LDC2009T13	The team concentrates on about a dozen mainstream Web sites -- such as chat rooms set up by the BBC and Al-Jazeera or charismatic Muslim figures like Amr Khaled, as well as Arab news sites like Elaph.com.
18012	NYT_ENG_20070921.0187.LDC2009T13	They choose them based on high traffic and a focus on U.S. policy, and they always identify themselves as being from the State Department.
18013	NYT_ENG_20070921.0187.LDC2009T13	They avoid radical sites, although team members note that jihadis troll everywhere.
18014	NYT_ENG_20070921.0187.LDC2009T13	The State Department bloggers themselves said they thought they would be immediately "flamed," or insulted and blocked from posting.
18015	NYT_ENG_20070921.0187.LDC2009T13	But so far only the webmaster at the Islamic Falluja Forums (www.al-faloja.info) has revoked their password and told them to get lost, the bloggers said.
18016	NYT_ENG_20070921.0187.LDC2009T13	Not that they don't attract plenty of skeptical, sarcastic responses.
18017	NYT_ENG_20070921.0187.LDC2009T13	One man identifying himself as an Arab in Germany commented that they were trying to put lipstick on a pig.
18018	NYT_ENG_20070921.0187.LDC2009T13	During congressional testimony last week by Gen. David H. Petraeus, for example, the two-man team went into chat rooms to ask people their opinion.

18020	NYT_ENG_20070921.0187.LDC2009T13	Another noted that Iraqis were better off before the invasion, while a third jokingly asked the Digital Outreach Team for a green card.
18021	NYT_ENG_20070921.0187.LDC2009T13	Jawad's responses tend toward the earnest: "We do not deny that the situation in Iraq is difficult, but we are achieving success in decreasing the level of violence there with the contribution of the Iraqis who care about their nation and who reject the terrorists and killers who target their victims based on sect," he wrote at one point.
18022	NYT_ENG_20070921.0187.LDC2009T13	He directed the green card writer to the Web sites describing how to apply.
18023	NYT_ENG_20070921.0187.LDC2009T13	Jawad and his co-blogger, Muath al-Sufi, are circumspect about biographical details that would allow readers to pigeonhole them by their roots, religion or education.
18024	NYT_ENG_20070921.0187.LDC2009T13	Jawad, would only say that he is in his 30s, was born in Texas and raised around the Arab World.
18025	NYT_ENG_20070921.0187.LDC2009T13	Sufi also said he was in his 30s.
18026	NYT_ENG_20070921.0187.LDC2009T13	The team said certain topics repeat regularly, including arguments over the accusations that U.S. soldiers tortured Iraqis at Abu Ghraib and President Bush's comment that the fight against terrorism is a "crusade."
18027	NYT_ENG_20070921.0187.LDC2009T13	Much time is also spent trying to douse the Internet brush fires that erupt whenever prominent Americans from talk-show hosts to politicians make anti-Muslim remarks of the "bomb Mecca" variety.
18028	NYT_ENG_20070921.0187.LDC2009T13	Each response is carefully crafted in English by the blogging team and translated into often poetic Arabic.
18029	NYT_ENG_20070921.0187.LDC2009T13	"We try to put ourselves in the mindset of someone receiving the message," said Duncan MacInnes, the director of the Counterterrorism Communication Center, of which the bloggers are one branch.

18033	NYT_ENG_20070921.0187.LDC2009T13	"Analysts said they had been surprised by the positive response, with people seemingly eager to engage, although the overall impact is impossible to assess.

18035	NYT_ENG_20070921.0187.LDC2009T13	"They are talking about peace and dialogue, and I think that makes it difficult for those debating them to justify criticizing them."
18036	NYT_ENG_20070921.0187.LDC2009T13	Toraifi said the bloggers had generated some debate in the Arab World and had been the subject of a column in an Algerian newspaper lauding the State Department for discussing policy with ordinary people, something the writer said the Algerian government would never do.
18037	NYT_ENG_20070921.0187.LDC2009T13	Indeed, several analysts said having State Department employees on the Web helps to counter one source of radicalization -- the sense that Washington is too arrogant to listen to the grievances of ordinary Arabs, so violence is the sole means to attract attention.

18039	NYT_ENG_20070921.0187.LDC2009T13	They even steer clear of arguments, instead posting straightforward snapshots of U.S. policy.
18040	NYT_ENG_20070921.0187.LDC2009T13	Jawad is often maligned as a "U.S. agent," including by Radad, the man of the "just Shiites" remark.

18045	NYT_ENG_20071001.0092.LDC2009T13	Cox News Service
18046	NYT_ENG_20071001.0092.LDC2009T13	WASHINGTON - President Bush named Navy Adm. Mike Mullen as the 17th chairman of the joint chiefs of staff on Monday, charging him to "fight and win" what the administration calls the global war on terror.
18047	NYT_ENG_20071001.0092.LDC2009T13	With the country struggling through the fifth costly year of fighting in Iraq, Mullen responded that four decades of Navy service had prepared him for the job of top military adviser to the president and the secretary of defense.
18048	NYT_ENG_20071001.0092.LDC2009T13	"I'm ready to take the watch," said Mullen, 60, a former aircraft carrier battle group commander who has been serving as chief of naval operations.
18049	NYT_ENG_20071001.0092.LDC2009T13	His most urgent challenge will be to advise Bush on the way forward in Iraq, where 3,800 U.S. troops have died and 28,000 have been wounded since Bush launched the invasion in March, 2003.
18050	NYT_ENG_20071001.0092.LDC2009T13	"I understand the frustration over the war.
18051	NYT_ENG_20071001.0092.LDC2009T13	I share it," Mullen said during confirmation hearings before the Senate Armed Services Committee last July, putting particular emphasis on the stress the war is placing on U.S. forces and equipment.
18052	NYT_ENG_20071001.0092.LDC2009T13	"There is strain.
18053	NYT_ENG_20071001.0092.LDC2009T13	We are stretched," Mullen testified.
18054	NYT_ENG_20071001.0092.LDC2009T13	"The U.S. military remains the strongest in all the world, but it is not unbreakable."
18055	NYT_ENG_20071001.0092.LDC2009T13	Mullen said in his testimony that this year's troop surge was improving security in Iraq, but only political reconciliation among Iraqis could lead to a stable country.
18056	NYT_ENG_20071001.0092.LDC2009T13	"Barring that," said Mullen, "no amount of troops and no amount of time will make much of a difference.'
18057	NYT_ENG_20071001.0092.LDC2009T13	Beneath brilliant October skies, Mullen was sworn in at Fort Myer, former Civil War fortifications built to defend Washington against Confederate attack on land confiscated from the family of Gen. Robert E. Lee.
18058	NYT_ENG_20071001.0092.LDC2009T13	Mullen replaced Gen. Peter Pace, who retired Monday after 40 years and three months in the Marine Corps amid speculation of a possible political run.
18059	NYT_ENG_20071001.0092.LDC2009T13	On a day when the conservative National Review called on Virginia Republicans to draft Pace to run next year for the seat of retiring Sen. John Warner, R-Va., Bush, the titular GOP banner carrier, signaled his own support for Pace.
18060	NYT_ENG_20071001.0092.LDC2009T13	Bush said the Marine demonstrated an ability to deal with "the rough and sometimes bitter world of Washington" and was able to "bring selflessness to a city filled with egos and a dignity to a political process that might have worn down a lesser man."
18061	NYT_ENG_20071001.0092.LDC2009T13	"I also have a sense that General Pace is not going to end it all here," said Bush.
18062	NYT_ENG_20071001.0092.LDC2009T13	"He's a man who has always put country first and he will find new ways to serve."
18063	NYT_ENG_20071001.0092.LDC2009T13	Pace, who caused a stir last spring by saying homosexuality is "immoral," lashed out at the nation's political climate, saying "personal venom" often surfaced in lieu of civil dialogue.
18064	NYT_ENG_20071001.0092.LDC2009T13	And, in a dig at congressional Democrats who have introduced legislation aimed at bringing home U.S. forces from Iraq, Pace warned against efforts to "vote our way out of a war."
18065	NYT_ENG_20071001.0092.LDC2009T13	"What worries me is that, in some instances right now, we have individuals who are more interested in making somebody else look bad than they are in finding the right solution," Pace said in his farewell address.
18066	NYT_ENG_20071001.0092.LDC2009T13	"They are more interested in letting their personal venom come forward instead of talking about how do we get from where we are to where we need to be."
18067	NYT_ENG_20071001.0092.LDC2009T13	Said Pace, "I just want everyone to understand that this dialogue is not about 'Can we vote our way out of a war?'
18068	NYT_ENG_20071001.0092.LDC2009T13	We have an enemy who has declared war on us.
18069	NYT_ENG_20071001.0092.LDC2009T13	We are in a war.

18072	NYT_ENG_20071002.0152.LDC2009T13	ANITA HILL SAYS SHE HASN ' T PUT THOMAS DISPUTE BEHIND HER
18073	NYT_ENG_20071002.0152.LDC2009T13	WASHINGTON - On Sunday evening, Anita Hill turned on the television at her Waltham, Mass., home to watch "60 Minutes."
18074	NYT_ENG_20071002.0152.LDC2009T13	She knew the man she had famously accused of sexual harassment, Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, would appear on the show to promote his autobiography.
18075	NYT_ENG_20071002.0152.LDC2009T13	Hill expected Thomas to attack her credibility.
18076	NYT_ENG_20071002.0152.LDC2009T13	But, she said, she did not expect such intensity.
18077	NYT_ENG_20071002.0152.LDC2009T13	Sixteen years after Hill's testimony nearly scuttled Thomas's nomination, a new generation of Americans heard Thomas label his accuser a liar, adding: "She was not the demure, religious, conservative person that they portrayed."
18078	NYT_ENG_20071002.0152.LDC2009T13	Absorbing these allegations, Hill said, she once again found herself shocked by Thomas's words.
18079	NYT_ENG_20071002.0152.LDC2009T13	"I am surprised he has held on to the anger for that long," Hill said in an interview.
18080	NYT_ENG_20071002.0152.LDC2009T13	"I'm surprised at the level of intensity 16 years later."
18081	NYT_ENG_20071002.0152.LDC2009T13	Hill, now 51, said that when she heard about Thomas's book, she was reluctant to re-engage in the dispute that riveted the nation in 1991.
18082	NYT_ENG_20071002.0152.LDC2009T13	But, she said, she decided she needed to defend herself.
18083	NYT_ENG_20071002.0152.LDC2009T13	She said she stands by her sworn testimony.
18084	NYT_ENG_20071002.0152.LDC2009T13	She said Thomas did make suggestive statements to her and talk about pornographic movies.
18085	NYT_ENG_20071002.0152.LDC2009T13	She noted, as she did in 1991, that she took a polygraph test and passed it, while Thomas declined to be tested.
18086	NYT_ENG_20071002.0152.LDC2009T13	She said she rejects the suggestion this week by Thomas's wife, Virginia, that she issue an apology.
18087	NYT_ENG_20071002.0152.LDC2009T13	Moreover, Hill has not put the episode behind her, either.
18088	NYT_ENG_20071002.0152.LDC2009T13	A few weeks ago, she began a sabbatical from her teaching job at Brandeis University, beginning a one-year stint as a visiting scholar at Wellesley College that will enable her for the first time to go through all of the 20,000 or so letters she received after testifying against Thomas.
18089	NYT_ENG_20071002.0152.LDC2009T13	The letters are a mix of stories of other people's experiences with sexual harassment, support for her decision to take on Thomas, and condemnations of her testimony.
18090	NYT_ENG_20071002.0152.LDC2009T13	By studying the letters, she said, she hopes to find a deeper meaning in the turmoil that she and Thomas - and the country - experienced.
18091	NYT_ENG_20071002.0152.LDC2009T13	Now, the publication of Thomas's book, "My Grandfather's Son," has put Hill back in a place she thought she had left long ago - the national stage.
18092	NYT_ENG_20071002.0152.LDC2009T13	"What I found very surprising is this is a Supreme Court justice," Hill said.
18093	NYT_ENG_20071002.0152.LDC2009T13	"He is making these claims that have either been disproved or he is making claims for which he has no proof.
18094	NYT_ENG_20071002.0152.LDC2009T13	He is talking in these generalities without specifics, making statements inconsistent with the known facts.
18095	NYT_ENG_20071002.0152.LDC2009T13	Having a Supreme Court justice do that was what was so shocking about it ... it is still painful to have those kinds of things said."
18096	NYT_ENG_20071002.0152.LDC2009T13	Supporters of Thomas, meanwhile, welcome the possibility that the book may spark a reexamination of the Thomas-Hill clash.
18097	NYT_ENG_20071002.0152.LDC2009T13	Wendy Long, who first met Thomas in 1987 and clerked for him in 1997, said that Hill's allegations are "the most inconsistent thing in the universe" about the man she knows.
18098	NYT_ENG_20071002.0152.LDC2009T13	"Her story was always uncorroborated," Long, who is counsel to the conservative Judicial Confirmation Network, said of Hill.
18099	NYT_ENG_20071002.0152.LDC2009T13	Hill first began working for Thomas when he was assistant secretary of education for civil rights, and she kept working for him when he became chairman of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission under President Ronald Reagan.
18100	NYT_ENG_20071002.0152.LDC2009T13	Hill asserts that Thomas sexually harassed her when they worked together in the education department, making unwanted advances and suggestive comments about pornographic movies.
18101	NYT_ENG_20071002.0152.LDC2009T13	She said that she followed him to a second department because she thought "the behavior had stopped."
18102	NYT_ENG_20071002.0152.LDC2009T13	But she said it started again.
18103	NYT_ENG_20071002.0152.LDC2009T13	After Thomas was nominated for the Supreme Court, Hill told congressional investigators about the alleged harassment.
18104	NYT_ENG_20071002.0152.LDC2009T13	Hill testified at a contentious hearing that became a nationally televised referendum on his character and her credibility.
18105	NYT_ENG_20071002.0152.LDC2009T13	Eventually, Thomas's nomination was approved 52-to-48 by the Senate.
18106	NYT_ENG_20071002.0152.LDC2009T13	For years, Thomas's refusal to speak publicly about the experience - reinforced by his practice of rarely speaking from the bench - seemed to indicate that the controversy was buried.
18107	NYT_ENG_20071002.0152.LDC2009T13	But then he accepted a $1.5 million advance for the book, saying he was determined to set the record straight.
18108	NYT_ENG_20071002.0152.LDC2009T13	In the book, Thomas wrote that a colleague asked him to hire Hill in 1981 even though she had told him that "I detest" Reagan.
18109	NYT_ENG_20071002.0152.LDC2009T13	He hired her and initially found her work "adequate," Thomas wrote.
18110	NYT_ENG_20071002.0152.LDC2009T13	Thomas then drew a series of unflattering descriptions of Hill.
18111	NYT_ENG_20071002.0152.LDC2009T13	On one page, for example, Thomas wrote: "Hill had been nagging me to write her a letter or recommendation"
18112	NYT_ENG_20071002.0152.LDC2009T13	"Anita wasn't performing up to expectations and failed to finish her assignments on time"
18113	NYT_ENG_20071002.0152.LDC2009T13	and "I hadn't realized her work had been so deficient."
18114	NYT_ENG_20071002.0152.LDC2009T13	He also referred to "Anita's rude attitude" and called her "sullen and withdrawn."
18115	NYT_ENG_20071002.0152.LDC2009T13	On the same page, Thomas suggested that Hill was too interested in him personally.
18116	NYT_ENG_20071002.0152.LDC2009T13	"It had been bothering me as well that she seemed far too interested in my social calendar," he wrote.
18117	NYT_ENG_20071002.0152.LDC2009T13	"She regularly inquired about my after-hours activities and on more than one occasion had asked if she could accompany me to professional functions."
18118	NYT_ENG_20071002.0152.LDC2009T13	Hill, asked about these accusations, responded, "I have no idea what he is talking about."
18119	NYT_ENG_20071002.0152.LDC2009T13	During the hearing, Hill testified that Thomas spoke to her "about acts that he had seen in pornographic films involving such matters as women having sex with animals, and films showing group sex or rape scenes.
18120	NYT_ENG_20071002.0152.LDC2009T13	... On several occasions Thomas told me graphically of his own sexual prowess.
18121	NYT_ENG_20071002.0152.LDC2009T13	Because I was extremely uncomfortable talking about sex with him at all, and particularly in such a graphic way, I told him that I did not want to talk about these subjects."
18122	NYT_ENG_20071002.0152.LDC2009T13	Thomas does not go into a count-by-count refutation of Hill's allegations.
18123	NYT_ENG_20071002.0152.LDC2009T13	Instead, he writes: "I have no intention of repeating the dirty details here.
18124	NYT_ENG_20071002.0152.LDC2009T13	Suffice it to say that it was a relief to hear them at long last, since there was no truth to them: they were nothing more than extravagant fiction concocted so as to have the maximum possible impact on the public."
18125	NYT_ENG_20071002.0152.LDC2009T13	Hill said she has not considered suing Thomas over his statements.
18126	NYT_ENG_20071002.0152.LDC2009T13	Thomas and Hill have not spoken to each other since before the hearings.
18127	NYT_ENG_20071002.0152.LDC2009T13	In 1997, Hill released her memoir of the hearing, "Speaking Truth to Power," in which she wrote that Thomas once warned her that if she spoke about his behavior "it would ruin his career."
18128	NYT_ENG_20071002.0152.LDC2009T13	In the nine years since she moved to Massachusetts and began teaching at Brandeis, Hill said, she has mostly led a quiet life, enjoying the cultural and academic attractions of Massachusetts.
18129	NYT_ENG_20071002.0152.LDC2009T13	She spoke in 2005 at Faneuil Hall on Martin Luther King Day, which she called inspiring for someone who was the youngest of 13 children growing up on an Oklahoma farm.
18130	NYT_ENG_20071002.0152.LDC2009T13	She hopes her latest project, the examination of the letters received after her testimony, will produce some kind of artistic work - perhaps a performance of readings - that will help educate people about sexual harassment.
18131	NYT_ENG_20071002.0152.LDC2009T13	"People say, 'Well, it is over now,"' Hill said.
18132	NYT_ENG_20071002.0152.LDC2009T13	But she said, "It is part of my life.
18133	NYT_ENG_20071002.0152.LDC2009T13	I've tried to make it a part of my life that is a positive part.
18134	NYT_ENG_20071002.0152.LDC2009T13	I don't want to ignore it either."

18136	NYT_ENG_20071009.0115.LDC2009T13	Soon after the future Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas entered the first grade, his destitute mother made a momentous decision.
18137	NYT_ENG_20071009.0115.LDC2009T13	Unable to provide for her two sons, she sent them to live with her parents, who owned a small house in the black section of Savannah, Ga.
18138	NYT_ENG_20071009.0115.LDC2009T13	There they were greeted by Myers Anderson, known to his grandchildren as Daddy, who announced brusquely, "The damn vacation is over."

18147	NYT_ENG_20071009.0115.LDC2009T13	It's a strange hybrid.
18148	NYT_ENG_20071009.0115.LDC2009T13	The book begins as a moving evocation of a difficult childhood in the Deep South and, as Thomas works his way though college and law school, takes on the outlines of an inspirational American success story.
18149	NYT_ENG_20071009.0115.LDC2009T13	The tone changes when Thomas, fed up with liberal policies on race, accepts Ronald Reagan's invitation to run the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, becoming an object of contempt and derision for mainstream civil rights organizations.
18150	NYT_ENG_20071009.0115.LDC2009T13	Thomas, recounting his years in government, adopts a defensive crouch, lashing out at his enemies, reopening old wounds and itemizing insults that should be forgotten.
18151	NYT_ENG_20071009.0115.LDC2009T13	All is prelude to the turbulent confirmation hearings for his appointment to the Supreme Court.
18152	NYT_ENG_20071009.0115.LDC2009T13	Thomas revisits this painful episode, fresh in his memory, and picks apart the charges leveled against him by Anita Hill, his former employee at the commission, in an earnest but ultimately pointless effort to set the record straight and settle some scores along the way.
18153	NYT_ENG_20071009.0115.LDC2009T13	Here, emotions get the better of him, as he portrays himself as a persecuted, almost Christlike figure singled out by the liberal establishment, at the behest of his civil rights enemies, not just for criticism but also for total annihilation.
18154	NYT_ENG_20071009.0115.LDC2009T13	You wonder if, when writing these fiery chapters, Thomas recalled his own admiring words about his grandfather.
18155	NYT_ENG_20071009.0115.LDC2009T13	"Despite the hardships he had faced, there was no bitterness or self-pity in his heart," he writes in an early chapter.
18156	NYT_ENG_20071009.0115.LDC2009T13	In this respect Thomas is not his grandfather's son.
18157	NYT_ENG_20071009.0115.LDC2009T13	His critics might not be moved by his political arguments, but his memoir gives them a man, not a caricature, to attack.
18158	NYT_ENG_20071009.0115.LDC2009T13	Thomas faced enormous obstacles in life.
18159	NYT_ENG_20071009.0115.LDC2009T13	His deadbeat father, referred to only as C, abandoned his family to a life of poverty so extreme that the children did not put sugar on their cereal.
18160	NYT_ENG_20071009.0115.LDC2009T13	Daddy, whose small fuel-oil business provided a modest income, sent Clarence to Catholic schools, but the harsh racial environment in Georgia put enormous pressure on black children trying to move further than their parents.
18161	NYT_ENG_20071009.0115.LDC2009T13	As one of only two black students at his seminary school, Thomas experienced panic, followed by "a constant state of controlled anxiety."
18162	NYT_ENG_20071009.0115.LDC2009T13	The fear of failure haunted him in a way that no white child could understand, or black parents either, accustomed to living behind the walls of segregation that were now falling down.
18163	NYT_ENG_20071009.0115.LDC2009T13	"We had always believed that we could do as well as whites if we were only given a fair shake -- but what if it turned out that we weren't good enough after all?"
18164	NYT_ENG_20071009.0115.LDC2009T13	he writes.
18165	NYT_ENG_20071009.0115.LDC2009T13	A fierce sense of discipline and a belief in hard work carried him from one academic triumph to another, culminating in a law degree from Yale, a university he grew to despise for reasons not altogether clear.
18166	NYT_ENG_20071009.0115.LDC2009T13	Along the way he grew an Afro and embraced radical politics.
18167	NYT_ENG_20071009.0115.LDC2009T13	"The more injustice I saw, the angrier I became, and the angrier I became, the more injustice I saw," he writes.
18168	NYT_ENG_20071009.0115.LDC2009T13	What changed was his analysis of who was to blame.
18169	NYT_ENG_20071009.0115.LDC2009T13	Deeply disturbed by the court-ordered busing of black children to white schools, he came to the conclusion that liberal policies on race, especially welfare and affirmative action, were harming rather than helping blacks.
18170	NYT_ENG_20071009.0115.LDC2009T13	Thomas describes his intellectual journey, and his struggle to keep body and soul together on meager government pay, in some of the book's most absorbing and self-critical chapters.
18171	NYT_ENG_20071009.0115.LDC2009T13	He regretted his early marriage, but for years could not bring himself to end the relationship and abandon his young son as his own father had.
18172	NYT_ENG_20071009.0115.LDC2009T13	(Eventually he did.)
18173	NYT_ENG_20071009.0115.LDC2009T13	He began drinking heavily.
18174	NYT_ENG_20071009.0115.LDC2009T13	His finances were a shambles.
18175	NYT_ENG_20071009.0115.LDC2009T13	At one point a rental-car clerk, after calling Sears for confirmation, cut up his credit card in front of him.
18176	NYT_ENG_20071009.0115.LDC2009T13	This is the vulnerable figure his enemies could not see, Thomas complains, "an ordinary person who, like most people, had worked out his problems step by unsure step."
18177	NYT_ENG_20071009.0115.LDC2009T13	At the same time, influenced by thinkers like the free-market economist Thomas Sowell, he began questioning government intervention as a way to improve the lot of black Americans.
18178	NYT_ENG_20071009.0115.LDC2009T13	Like his grandfather, he came to regard welfare as the "ruination"of blacks, embracing instead a philosophy of total self-reliance.
18179	NYT_ENG_20071009.0115.LDC2009T13	This ideological shift set him on a collision course with traditional civil rights groups and, he argues, poisoned the atmosphere around his court appointment.
18180	NYT_ENG_20071009.0115.LDC2009T13	His refusal to accept "the liberal pieties that had done so much damage to blacks in America," he writes, "meant that I had to be destroyed."
18181	NYT_ENG_20071009.0115.LDC2009T13	Throughout his life Thomas has met adversity with angry defiance and iron resolve.
18182	NYT_ENG_20071009.0115.LDC2009T13	Waking up with a hangover one day, he took the last two beers from his refrigerator, drank them while taking a hot bath and ended his career as a drinker there and then.
18183	NYT_ENG_20071009.0115.LDC2009T13	When he looked in the mirror and decided he was out of shape, he vowed to run a marathon in 100 days, which he did, in fast time.
18184	NYT_ENG_20071009.0115.LDC2009T13	Overcoming any obstacle, he writes, is "a question of will."
18185	NYT_ENG_20071009.0115.LDC2009T13	In this vein, he writes of overcoming his initial reluctance to accept the first President Bush's invitation to join the Supreme Court, an offer he reacted to viscerally: "I felt sick."
18186	NYT_ENG_20071009.0115.LDC2009T13	He recovered.
18187	NYT_ENG_20071009.0115.LDC2009T13	"Neither then nor at any other time did it occur to me that I could not do the work of a Supreme Court justice," he writes with characteristic aplomb.
18188	NYT_ENG_20071009.0115.LDC2009T13	For that self-confidence, there is one person to thank, his grandfather, and Thomas does, in words of one syllable.
18189	NYT_ENG_20071009.0115.LDC2009T13	"What I am," he writes, "is what he made me."

18195	NYT_ENG_20071021.0027.LDC2009T13	A big increase, of a sort, is scheduled this week in corporate earnings.
18196	NYT_ENG_20071021.0027.LDC2009T13	The number of statements issued will grow significantly, though not necessarily the profits reported in them.
18197	NYT_ENG_20071021.0027.LDC2009T13	With a sparse economic calendar and a Federal Reserve interest rate decision lurking a week away, the avalanche of earnings reports may be foremost on traders' minds.

18201	NYT_ENG_20071021.0027.LDC2009T13	"We're going to have a continuous stream of earnings that people will be watching during the week," said Tobias Levkovich, chief U.S. equity strategist at Citigroup Investment Research.
18202	NYT_ENG_20071021.0027.LDC2009T13	Results announced so far have been better than expected for many companies, he noted.
18203	NYT_ENG_20071021.0027.LDC2009T13	An important reason, though, is that expectations have fallen in recent weeks, as often happens before reports are issued.
18204	NYT_ENG_20071021.0027.LDC2009T13	Chief financial officers and analysts seem to do a quarterly pas de deux that leads to a reduction in estimates.
18205	NYT_ENG_20071021.0027.LDC2009T13	When numbers are announced that a few weeks earlier would have seemed ordinary, traders are impressed.

18209	NYT_ENG_20071021.0027.LDC2009T13	Expectations of a Fed rate cut have also diminished, Levkovich said.
18210	NYT_ENG_20071021.0027.LDC2009T13	Around a month ago, futures contracts suggested that traders put the chance of a cut in the federal funds rate at 90 percent.
18211	NYT_ENG_20071021.0027.LDC2009T13	Late last week, it was a tossup.
18212	NYT_ENG_20071021.0027.LDC2009T13	"Expectations have come down a lot" for a cut next week, he said, but traders anticipate a cut later in the year if the Fed does not move at this meeting.
18213	NYT_ENG_20071021.0027.LDC2009T13	Either way, he said, the consensus outlook is for "one more and done."
18214	NYT_ENG_20071021.0027.LDC2009T13	Wall Street considers the Fed's response to the summer credit crisis to have been "broadly successful but not fully successful," he said, explaining the market's call for one further rate cut.

18220	NYT_ENG_20071024.0170.LDC2009T13	CONSERVATIVES LEFT WITHOUT A VOICE ON ' THE VIEW '
18221	NYT_ENG_20071024.0170.LDC2009T13	When Elisabeth Hasselbeck bade farewell to her cohosts on "The View" Tuesday, it was all hugs, well-wishes, and baby-product endorsements.
18222	NYT_ENG_20071024.0170.LDC2009T13	But as Hasselbeck begins her 2-1/2 month maternity leave, the political landscape is shifting, as well.
18223	NYT_ENG_20071024.0170.LDC2009T13	America's most dangerous conservative - or so some liberals see it - is leaving TV for a while.
18224	NYT_ENG_20071024.0170.LDC2009T13	Hasselbeck, the apple-cheeked blonde with the football-player husband, consistently draws a brand of hatred from the left that Hillary Clinton generates from the right
18225	NYT_ENG_20071024.0170.LDC2009T13	"screechmonger" is one of the more printable slurs hurled at her from the blogosphere.
18226	NYT_ENG_20071024.0170.LDC2009T13	Barry Manilow has called her "offensive."
18227	NYT_ENG_20071024.0170.LDC2009T13	Alicia Silverstone once refused to touch her.
18228	NYT_ENG_20071024.0170.LDC2009T13	And that an America's sweetheart-type would generate such vitriol says a lot about the state of debate in a polarized country.
18229	NYT_ENG_20071024.0170.LDC2009T13	Hasselbeck is a far cry from the most prominent conservative women on the cable talk-show circuit, the ones who deal in slick sarcasm, publish books that vilify liberals ("Godless" and "Slander" both by Ann Coulter, "Unhinged" by Michelle Malkin) and take obvious pleasure in a claws-out fight.
18230	NYT_ENG_20071024.0170.LDC2009T13	The youngest member of "The View" lineup is hardly a master debater
18231	NYT_ENG_20071024.0170.LDC2009T13	she's always outnumbered and usually outargued.
18232	NYT_ENG_20071024.0170.LDC2009T13	But she has a prominent daily forum for her antiabortion, pro-war views - "The View" often reaches more than 3 million viewers each day.
18233	NYT_ENG_20071024.0170.LDC2009T13	And Hasselbeck represents "an audience that the left just can't crack: traditional, God-fearing red state women, well-intended, who have made up their minds and won't hear it.
18234	NYT_ENG_20071024.0170.LDC2009T13	Won't hear otherwise," said Matthew Felling, editor of Public Eye, the CBSNews.com media commentary site.
18235	NYT_ENG_20071024.0170.LDC2009T13	To her like-minded fans, Felling said, Hasselbeck's lack of slickness is a strength.
18236	NYT_ENG_20071024.0170.LDC2009T13	"Regardless of how much effort or thought she puts into her views or stances, it comes across as just from the heart.
18237	NYT_ENG_20071024.0170.LDC2009T13	Or from the gut.
18238	NYT_ENG_20071024.0170.LDC2009T13	Which is one of the strengths of the conservative conversation."
18239	NYT_ENG_20071024.0170.LDC2009T13	Indeed, with her storybook personal history - she married her Boston College sweetheart, who happens to be an NFL quarterback - Hasselbeck represents a new image for conservative punditry, more Ann Romney than Ann Coulter.
18240	NYT_ENG_20071024.0170.LDC2009T13	As Republicans struggle to connect with women and gird for a possible female Democratic nominee, Hasselbeck gives voice to a crucial set of voters, said longtime GOP consultant Frank Donatelli.
18241	NYT_ENG_20071024.0170.LDC2009T13	"She's got a platform that very few people have," said Donatelli, who is working for Senator John McCain.
18242	NYT_ENG_20071024.0170.LDC2009T13	"She speaks to a huge constituency of women where it's fair to say the Republican Party needs some help."
18243	NYT_ENG_20071024.0170.LDC2009T13	Analysts tend to label them "security moms": married women with children who care about micro-issues of safety and household economics.
18244	NYT_ENG_20071024.0170.LDC2009T13	Hasselbeck is much more ideological than most
18245	NYT_ENG_20071024.0170.LDC2009T13	her views seem driven in large part by the abortion debate.
18246	NYT_ENG_20071024.0170.LDC2009T13	But her family-driven passions could prove crucial in swing states, Donatelli said: "Those kinds of issues that appeal to the middle segment of women and younger families generally will be very, very important."
18247	NYT_ENG_20071024.0170.LDC2009T13	It's unclear whether any campaigns have reached out to Hasselbeck, who will return to "The View" in January, just after the Republican Iowa caucuses.
18248	NYT_ENG_20071024.0170.LDC2009T13	Through a spokesman for "The View," Hasselbeck declined an interview request.
18249	NYT_ENG_20071024.0170.LDC2009T13	On Tuesday, she was scheduled to fly to Arizona, where her husband, Tim Hasselbeck, recently signed with the Arizona Cardinals.
18250	NYT_ENG_20071024.0170.LDC2009T13	But at a time when talk-show hosts are trying harder than ever to wield political influence - Oprah Winfrey has put her name and fund-raising clout behind Senator Barack Obama's Democratic presidential bid - it's easy to imagine that some campaigns would eye Hasselbeck as a prize.
18251	NYT_ENG_20071024.0170.LDC2009T13	Hasselbeck didn't start her career with politics in mind.
18252	NYT_ENG_20071024.0170.LDC2009T13	The Rhode Island native first gained national fame as Elisabeth Filarski, a 23-year-old Newton resident who competed on the second installment of CBS's "Survivor."
18253	NYT_ENG_20071024.0170.LDC2009T13	She parlayed a final-four finish into a job hosting the Style Network show "The Look for Less."
18254	NYT_ENG_20071024.0170.LDC2009T13	In November 2003, she won a coveted slot as the designated "young person" on "The View's" all-female panel.
18255	NYT_ENG_20071024.0170.LDC2009T13	Hasselbeck quickly emerged as the show's resident conservative.
18256	NYT_ENG_20071024.0170.LDC2009T13	She spoke out for President George W. Bush during the 2004 election campaign, had a prime-time speaking gig at that year's Republican National Convention, and attended a White House state dinner with Queen Elizabeth.
18257	NYT_ENG_20071024.0170.LDC2009T13	When Rosie O'Donnell began a yearlong stint as the show's moderator last fall, her frequent spats with Hasselbeck - which at least once landed Hasselbeck in tears - made the YouTube rounds.
18258	NYT_ENG_20071024.0170.LDC2009T13	They also solidified Hasselbeck's image as a victim
18259	NYT_ENG_20071024.0170.LDC2009T13	her cohosts on "The View" tend to lecture her or treat her with gentle condescension.
18260	NYT_ENG_20071024.0170.LDC2009T13	"Elisabeth, calm down, dear," Barbara Walters said one day last year, after Hasselbeck delivered a passionate rant against the morning-after pill.
18261	NYT_ENG_20071024.0170.LDC2009T13	Earlier this week, when Hasselbeck criticized Republican pork barrel spending, cohost Joy Behar shouted, "Very good, Elisabeth," and Walters chimed in with, "Now that's a milestone!"
18262	NYT_ENG_20071024.0170.LDC2009T13	In part, those attitudes reflect the informal nature of the show, where hosts gab about their private lives and hew to the conceit that they're close friends.
18263	NYT_ENG_20071024.0170.LDC2009T13	Walters tends to preside with a maternal air
18264	NYT_ENG_20071024.0170.LDC2009T13	on Tuesday, on the air, she said she was nervous about Hasselbeck flying, and urged her to "call me as soon as you land."
18265	NYT_ENG_20071024.0170.LDC2009T13	But the fact that Hasselbeck faces off daily against three or four dissenters - however congenial they might be when the topic shifts from politics - generates respect among like minds, said E.M. Zanotti, 25, who runs a conservative blog called "American Princess."
18266	NYT_ENG_20071024.0170.LDC2009T13	"I can't imagine what it might be like to get up every day and do that," Zanotti said by phone from Ann Arbor, Mich., last week, as she fretted over her own upcoming appearance on CNN.
18267	NYT_ENG_20071024.0170.LDC2009T13	For aspiring conservative pundits, she said, Hasselbeck represents new opportunities for exposure.
18268	NYT_ENG_20071024.0170.LDC2009T13	"It helps to have someone out there like that," Zanotti said, so talk-show hosts and rival guests "aren't always assuming that they're going up against Ann Coulter, that they're going up against Michelle Malkin.
18269	NYT_ENG_20071024.0170.LDC2009T13	There are women out there ((with)) a different personality."
18270	NYT_ENG_20071024.0170.LDC2009T13	Indeed, as some female pundits say ever-more-outrageous things to get attention - promoting her latest book, Coulter recently told a CNBC host that "we just want Jews to be perfected" - Hasselbeck has found a niche by being earnest, guileless, and credibly authentic.
18271	NYT_ENG_20071024.0170.LDC2009T13	"A lot of the daily outrages are synthetic and manufactured," Felling said.

18281	NYT_ENG_20071025.0262.LDC2009T13	HOUSTON
18282	NYT_ENG_20071025.0262.LDC2009T13	A hug on Thursday between the commanders of the space shuttle Discovery and the International Space Station marked the first time that women have served in both roles at the same time.
18283	NYT_ENG_20071025.0262.LDC2009T13	Led by the shuttle commander, Pamela A. Melroy, and the station commander, Peggy A. Whitson, the crews met with shouts of greeting and hearty embraces as the two vehicles made their way around the earth at 17,000 mph, crossing over North Carolina.
18284	NYT_ENG_20071025.0262.LDC2009T13	The shuttle docked with the space station at 8:40 a.m. Eastern time after it was put through a back flip to allow astronauts on the station to shoot pictures of its belly.
18285	NYT_ENG_20071025.0262.LDC2009T13	Analysts on the ground study the pictures for any signs of damage from debris during liftoff.
18286	NYT_ENG_20071025.0262.LDC2009T13	The back flip is a maneuver that is now part of every shuttle mission to the space station.
18287	NYT_ENG_20071025.0262.LDC2009T13	It was begun after the loss of the shuttle Columbia and its crew in 2003 in an accident traced to damage by debris during the launching.
18288	NYT_ENG_20071025.0262.LDC2009T13	In an interview before the mission, Melroy, who is a retired Air Force colonel, said that performing the back flip so close to the station -- just 600 feet away -- was counterintuitive for a pilot.
18289	NYT_ENG_20071025.0262.LDC2009T13	"It certainly unsettled all of us when it was first discussed," she said.
18290	NYT_ENG_20071025.0262.LDC2009T13	"I mean, it's kind of: 'Turn my back on the airplane?
18291	NYT_ENG_20071025.0262.LDC2009T13	When I'm flying formation with it?
18292	NYT_ENG_20071025.0262.LDC2009T13	I don't think so."'
18293	NYT_ENG_20071025.0262.LDC2009T13	But time in the simulator made the pilots comfortable with the idea, the commander said.
18294	NYT_ENG_20071025.0262.LDC2009T13	"It becomes completely obvious why it is safe to do," she said.
18295	NYT_ENG_20071025.0262.LDC2009T13	"And it's OK."
18296	NYT_ENG_20071025.0262.LDC2009T13	In fact, she added, "I'm actually having fun with it."
18297	NYT_ENG_20071025.0262.LDC2009T13	Experts are still analyzing the pictures from the back flip and other sources of data on the ascent, and "they have not seen anything that would cause them concern at this time," John Shannon, the chairman of the mission management team, said in an afternoon briefing with reporters.
18298	NYT_ENG_20071025.0262.LDC2009T13	Just before the crew day officially ended, astronaut Dominic A. Antonelli called Discovery from mission control to tell Melroy that they had preliminarily decided that the shuttle came through its ascent with so little damage that they will probably not call for the "focused inspection" that would occur midway through the flight and which requires more than three hours.
18299	NYT_ENG_20071025.0262.LDC2009T13	"Oh, man, that is fantastic news!"
18300	NYT_ENG_20071025.0262.LDC2009T13	Melroy exclaimed over the radio link.
18301	NYT_ENG_20071025.0262.LDC2009T13	"It's obviously been a question that's very much on our minds."
18302	NYT_ENG_20071025.0262.LDC2009T13	She said, "We're pretty excited to hear about that" and added that it would give her team more time to work with the Harmony module.
18303	NYT_ENG_20071025.0262.LDC2009T13	"We just can't wait to get inside," she said.
18304	NYT_ENG_20071025.0262.LDC2009T13	The docking began 10 days of intense and challenging activity on the 14-day mission, starting with work on Friday to install Harmony, the first new living space for the station in six years.
18305	NYT_ENG_20071025.0262.LDC2009T13	In addition, an enormous solar array and truss will be moved into their permanent position.
18306	NYT_ENG_20071025.0262.LDC2009T13	"I told my team before we started this mission, 'This is the kind of mission we came to NASA for,"' Shannon said.

18348	NYT_ENG_20071108.0178.LDC2009T13	Israel says Egypt is doing far too little to stop the Palestinian Islamist group Hamas, which controls the Gaza Strip, from smuggling weapons, militants and cash into the area from Egypt, and is appealing to Cairo to do more.
18349	NYT_ENG_20071108.0178.LDC2009T13	At the same time, a senior Israeli legislator from the opposition Likud bloc who is close to the security services is lobbying the U.S. Senate to withhold some military aid to Egypt unless it takes action.
18350	NYT_ENG_20071108.0178.LDC2009T13	The legislator, Yuval Steinitz, has written to all U.S. senators to encourage them to support a move begun in the House of Representatives to freeze $200 million of a projected $1.3 billion in military aid to Egypt.
18351	NYT_ENG_20071108.0178.LDC2009T13	Steinitz said he was asked to write the letter by senators he met as a leader, with Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Ariz., of a joint group on defense that meets twice a year.
18352	NYT_ENG_20071108.0178.LDC2009T13	The House bill would freeze the $200 million until the secretary of state certified that Egypt "has taken concrete and measurable steps" to enact a law protecting the independence of the judiciary, to "curb police abuses" by providing training for police leadership and to "detect and destroy the smuggling network and smuggling tunnels that lead from Egypt to Gaza."
18353	NYT_ENG_20071108.0178.LDC2009T13	The Senate version urges Egypt to do more to stop smuggling but would not halt aid.
18354	NYT_ENG_20071108.0178.LDC2009T13	In his letter, Steinitz, former chairman of the Israeli Parliament's Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee and chairman of the security subcommittee, accuses Egypt of allowing Hamas to obtain 20,000 rifles, 6,000 anti-tank missiles, 100 tons of explosives, several dozen Katyusha rockets and shoulder-held anti-aircraft missiles every year.
18355	NYT_ENG_20071108.0178.LDC2009T13	In the last three months, Steinitz says, Egypt has allowed "the organized departure of large groups of operatives from Gaza for military training in Iran."
18356	NYT_ENG_20071108.0178.LDC2009T13	In September, he notes, 100 Gazans who had trained in Iran were allowed by Egypt to return home despite Israeli protests.
18357	NYT_ENG_20071108.0178.LDC2009T13	Egyptian authorities say the accusations are inaccurate and aimed at sabotaging Egyptian-U.S. relations.
18358	NYT_ENG_20071108.0178.LDC2009T13	They say that they have done all they can to try to safeguard the border, but are hamstrung by the 1979 Camp David agreement, which restricts the number of soldiers they can deploy there.
18359	NYT_ENG_20071108.0178.LDC2009T13	"Egypt can't have a real security presence on the border," said Fouad Allam, former director of Egyptian State Security.
18360	NYT_ENG_20071108.0178.LDC2009T13	"Egypt tried to amend this, and Israel refused."
18361	NYT_ENG_20071108.0178.LDC2009T13	Steinitz's assessments track those of the Israeli military and military intelligence.
18362	NYT_ENG_20071108.0178.LDC2009T13	His complaints are shared by the Israeli government.
18363	NYT_ENG_20071108.0178.LDC2009T13	Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni on Tuesday told her Egyptian counterpart, Ahmed Aboul Gheit, that "there is a real need for a determined effort to stop weapons smuggling into the Gaza Strip."
18364	NYT_ENG_20071108.0178.LDC2009T13	But the government does not associate itself with the Steinitz letter or its call to freeze aid to Egypt, which, like Jordan, has a formal peace treaty with Israel.
18365	NYT_ENG_20071108.0178.LDC2009T13	The U.S. House move was led by Reps. Gary Ackerman and Nita M. Lowey, both D-N.Y., who are strong supporters of Israel.

18367	NYT_ENG_20071108.0178.LDC2009T13	Lowey is chairwoman of the state and foreign operations subcommittee of the Appropriations Committee.
18368	NYT_ENG_20071108.0178.LDC2009T13	Ackerman told the newspaper Haaretz that Egypt had been allowing between $12 million and $20 million a month in cash to flow to Hamas, and said smuggling had worsened.
18369	NYT_ENG_20071108.0178.LDC2009T13	"Egypt is not helping as much as it can," he said.
18370	NYT_ENG_20071108.0178.LDC2009T13	Egypt has sent senior officials and military officers to Washington to argue against the freeze and to describe their efforts to stop the smuggling.
18371	NYT_ENG_20071108.0178.LDC2009T13	In a document given to legislators, Egypt suggested that some Israeli soldiers were helping smugglers.

18374	NYT_ENG_20071108.0178.LDC2009T13	A Senate foreign-policy aide, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the delicate nature of negotiations in Congress, said the Senate seemed unlikely to back withholding aid because it does not wish to signal a weakening of support when Egypt has a crucial role in the Middle East peace effort.
18375	NYT_ENG_20071108.0178.LDC2009T13	But the aide said the issue would have to be resolved in a conference committee.
18376	NYT_ENG_20071108.0178.LDC2009T13	On Wednesday, Egypt said that it had uncovered another six smuggling tunnels and destroyed them
18377	NYT_ENG_20071108.0178.LDC2009T13	it announced the destruction of others on the eve of U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice's last trip there.
18378	NYT_ENG_20071108.0178.LDC2009T13	Months ago, just after Hamas took control of Gaza, men in the border town of Rafah who had identified themselves as smugglers said that when smugglers were caught ferrying goods or weapons into Gaza, they were treated more leniently by judges who were sympathetic to the Palestinian cause.
18379	NYT_ENG_20071108.0178.LDC2009T13	They also said that security guards at the border could be persuaded to look the other way for money.
18380	NYT_ENG_20071108.0178.LDC2009T13	Overall, Egypt's relationship with Hamas is complicated by domestic political concerns.
18381	NYT_ENG_20071108.0178.LDC2009T13	On one hand, analysts said, it is not in Egypt's interest to improve relations with Hamas, an offshoot of the banned Muslim Brotherhood.
18382	NYT_ENG_20071108.0178.LDC2009T13	On the other, Egypt does not want to be seen to be helping Israel over the Palestinians.
18383	NYT_ENG_20071108.0178.LDC2009T13	"I do not think that Egypt is re-examining its relationship with Hamas, because any legitimacy for Hamas negatively affects the legitimacy of the Egyptian regime," said Emad Gad, an analyst at the Ahram Center for Political and Strategic Studies in Cairo.
18384	NYT_ENG_20071108.0178.LDC2009T13	"Any success for Hamas is a success for the Muslim Brotherhood."
18385	NYT_ENG_20071108.0178.LDC2009T13	When Egypt opened its border with Gaza in September to allow Hamas militants to pass through, analysts in Egypt said that it was likely part of some deal, but that politically, they had no choice.
18386	NYT_ENG_20071108.0178.LDC2009T13	Newspapers in Egypt reported that Hamas turned over a wanted Qaida militant in exchange for the passage, a deal the government never confirmed.
18387	NYT_ENG_20071108.0178.LDC2009T13	"This would be a political crisis for Egypt," Gad said.
18388	NYT_ENG_20071108.0178.LDC2009T13	"People will say that Egypt is cooperating with Israel against the Palestinians.
18389	NYT_ENG_20071108.0178.LDC2009T13	And Egypt can not do this."
18390	NYT_ENG_20071108.0178.LDC2009T13	Analysts added that Egypt has cultivated an unofficial relationship with Hamas partly because it is such a large force that it can not be ignored and partly in the hope of bringing greater unity between Hamas and Fatah.

18407	NYT_ENG_20071112.0090.LDC2009T13	That is only one way some of the people hit hardest by the virus that leads to AIDS have taken a role in fighting the epidemic here.
18408	NYT_ENG_20071112.0090.LDC2009T13	Organized sex workers also have taken to the front lines in a search for solutions, participating in vaccine trials and teaching condom use, with some support from drug companies, nonprofit organizations and their government.
18409	NYT_ENG_20071112.0090.LDC2009T13	One source from which they don't get money, though, is the U.S. President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, which sent $6.4 million to fight the epidemic here last year, but with stipulations that preclude anyone who does not condemn sex work from getting the money.
18410	NYT_ENG_20071112.0090.LDC2009T13	Critics of that policy say the pledge has caused organizations to pull away from helping women who are both at the highest risk for catching the virus and in the greatest need of support.
18411	NYT_ENG_20071112.0090.LDC2009T13	"It's widely misunderstood," U.S. global AIDS coordinator Ambassador Mark Dybul responded recently.
18412	NYT_ENG_20071112.0090.LDC2009T13	While critics refer to the policy as an "anti-prostitution pledge," Dybul says, the policy aims to help women by taking a stand against a trade that he calls "damaging to gender equality."
18413	NYT_ENG_20071112.0090.LDC2009T13	He adds that PEPFAR money supports 120 programs that provide care and support services to women who are sex workers.
18414	NYT_ENG_20071112.0090.LDC2009T13	"There's a disconnect," Dybul says.
18415	NYT_ENG_20071112.0090.LDC2009T13	If there is, it works against vulnerable women, says Jodi Jacobson of American Jewish World Services, an organization that assists grass-roots groups and has turned down a U.S. faith-based initiative grant rather than take the pledge.
18416	NYT_ENG_20071112.0090.LDC2009T13	She added that the policy is vaguely worded.
18417	NYT_ENG_20071112.0090.LDC2009T13	"There's a requirement that people sign and adopt a policy opposing prostitution, whatever that might mean," Jacobson says.
18418	NYT_ENG_20071112.0090.LDC2009T13	"Also, there's a requirement that you not promote prostitution, whatever that means."
18419	NYT_ENG_20071112.0090.LDC2009T13	The result, she says, has been that organizations shy away from helping sex workers, fearing that it will cost them money.
18420	NYT_ENG_20071112.0090.LDC2009T13	"I would say Ambassador Dybul hasn't spoken to people affected directly by the pledge."
18421	NYT_ENG_20071112.0090.LDC2009T13	Conjugal visits at penitentiary
18422	NYT_ENG_20071112.0090.LDC2009T13	SANTO DOMINGO - Beachfront hotels and flashing casino lights are the fa?ade for a deeply divided and largely impoverished country, human rights activists here have said, pointing to the bateyes, former sugar cane plantations where imported Haitian laborers toiled for several decades for little more than subsistence, until even that money ran out.
18423	NYT_ENG_20071112.0090.LDC2009T13	Disparities are on display closer to the tourist destinations, too, along the Malecon seafront strip and the dim streets surrounding the colonial district where scores of streetwalkers wait for customers, and in gas stations where teenagers hop into cars driven by strangers.
18424	NYT_ENG_20071112.0090.LDC2009T13	Sex work is essentially legal here and institutionalized to the point that a recent law requires that "cabanas" - hotels that rent rooms by the hour - have two condoms in each room.
18425	NYT_ENG_20071112.0090.LDC2009T13	On the higher-priced end are bikini-clad women with dancers' bodies who line up in the blink of disco lights at takeout brothels behind pricey casino hotels.
18426	NYT_ENG_20071112.0090.LDC2009T13	They will spend the night with a customer for about $85.
18427	NYT_ENG_20071112.0090.LDC2009T13	On the more desperate end are women who visit the nearby penitentiary, where HIV rates are estimated to be as much as five times higher than those on the outside.
18428	NYT_ENG_20071112.0090.LDC2009T13	There, Wednesdays and Sundays are conjugal visiting days, when prisoners hang sheets over their bunks and sex workers serve prisoners for about 150 pesos, less than $5.
18429	NYT_ENG_20071112.0090.LDC2009T13	Some try to serve enough men to leave with 1,500 pesos.
18430	NYT_ENG_20071112.0090.LDC2009T13	"Sometimes they say they'll pay 100 pesos and then only pay half," a childlike young woman said on a recent visiting day.
18431	NYT_ENG_20071112.0090.LDC2009T13	To make money during the rest of the week, many women who visit the prison also work on the streets serving tourists, says Grace Butler de Mejia, who runs Fundacion Genesis, which works with the American nonprofit Health Through Walls to bring condoms to the prison.
18432	NYT_ENG_20071112.0090.LDC2009T13	"This is an international problem," de Mejia says.
18433	NYT_ENG_20071112.0090.LDC2009T13	'Now there is no work'
18434	NYT_ENG_20071112.0090.LDC2009T13	DUQUESA - To understand how a woman can bring herself to such a place, one must look at the alternatives, says Sonia Pierre, an activist for the rights of Dominican women of Haitian descent.
18435	NYT_ENG_20071112.0090.LDC2009T13	"The women who do sexual work in jail come almost exclusively from the bateyes," Pierre said recently.
18436	NYT_ENG_20071112.0090.LDC2009T13	"More than 12 years ago, the sugar companies began to pull out.
18437	NYT_ENG_20071112.0090.LDC2009T13	Because now there is no work, bateyes are places of women and children."
18438	NYT_ENG_20071112.0090.LDC2009T13	Ten minutes from the center of Santo Domingo, a garbage dump replaced sugar cane fields as a source of livelihood for the residents in Duquesa, a quarter-mile-long settlement off the road to the new airport.
18439	NYT_ENG_20071112.0090.LDC2009T13	Here a series of philanthropic efforts turned a one-room schoolhouse into two rooms.
18440	NYT_ENG_20071112.0090.LDC2009T13	It still does not draw many children, though, because they can better improve their immediate existences by diving in the dump.
18441	NYT_ENG_20071112.0090.LDC2009T13	There - among rotting garbage, medical waste and industrial chemicals, including battery acid and mercury - children find toys and treasures in what other people throw away: a handful of drinking straws, bits of metal, plastic and glass they can sell.
18442	NYT_ENG_20071112.0090.LDC2009T13	This is one of the better bateyes, says Pierre, who grew up in one and organized her first protest about conditions there at the age of 13.
18443	NYT_ENG_20071112.0090.LDC2009T13	Bateyes around Haina and San Cristobal are worse, she says.
18444	NYT_ENG_20071112.0090.LDC2009T13	Even for rural Dominicans not of Haitian descent and outside of bateyes, life is hard, offering few opportunities for women who struggle to support their families, Pierre stressed.
18445	NYT_ENG_20071112.0090.LDC2009T13	'Not for $200, not for $500!'
18446	NYT_ENG_20071112.0090.LDC2009T13	HAINA - By contrast, the rooms behind the Seaman Bar, where girls have sex with sailors for prices running from $15 to $20, are a haven, with roofs and running water.
18447	NYT_ENG_20071112.0090.LDC2009T13	The joking, squabbling and camaraderie of a girls' dormitory prevail here, where women decorate their rooms with rosaries, pictures of the Virgin Mary and snapshots of sailors.
18448	NYT_ENG_20071112.0090.LDC2009T13	Con suerte - with luck - they can make $500 a month, they say.
18449	NYT_ENG_20071112.0090.LDC2009T13	More often they earn less than half that.
18450	NYT_ENG_20071112.0090.LDC2009T13	When only a few ships dock, some make nothing at all.
18451	NYT_ENG_20071112.0090.LDC2009T13	Ships from around the world dock in this town in this industrial port town, with a weekly manifest showing visits from Miami, Savannah, Houston, New Orleans, as well as ports in Europe, South America and Asia.
18452	NYT_ENG_20071112.0090.LDC2009T13	Some of the children of women who work here reflect this diverse range of origins, with fathers from Haiti and the Philippines.
18453	NYT_ENG_20071112.0090.LDC2009T13	Jocelyn, a mother of three with a beatific smile, points to her 9 -month-old son and says his father is from India.
18454	NYT_ENG_20071112.0090.LDC2009T13	A sex worker who also has recently found a niche in HIV education, Jocelyn says she always uses condoms, except with the fathers of her children.
18455	NYT_ENG_20071112.0090.LDC2009T13	Fellow sex workers watch her children for her when she travels to nearby towns with a tote bag filled with condoms and an anatomically correct model to roll them onto, showing other sex workers how to insist on, or if necessary, cajole a thin layer of protection.
18456	NYT_ENG_20071112.0090.LDC2009T13	"People will offer them $100 to have sex without a condom," she says.
18457	NYT_ENG_20071112.0090.LDC2009T13	"I tell them, 'No!
18458	NYT_ENG_20071112.0090.LDC2009T13	Not for $200, not for $500!"'
18459	NYT_ENG_20071112.0090.LDC2009T13	The girls at the Seaman Bar can knock on her door at 1 o'clock in the morning to get condoms, she says
18460	NYT_ENG_20071112.0090.LDC2009T13	she keeps big bags full of them in the cramped, crowded two rooms across the street that she shares with six other people.
18461	NYT_ENG_20071112.0090.LDC2009T13	She gets paid for outreach work during funded projects now but stays in touch with the women whom she visits when she is not getting paid.
18462	NYT_ENG_20071112.0090.LDC2009T13	That way, she says, she won't have to start over when she is called upon to look for new women to recruit for a vaccine trial.
18463	NYT_ENG_20071112.0090.LDC2009T13	Jocelyn participated in one of the first trials for an anti-HIV vaccine run by "Dr. Ellen" when her friend Juliana recruited her.
18464	NYT_ENG_20071112.0090.LDC2009T13	The trial gave her access to health care, vitamins and information on how to avoid getting sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV, she says.
18465	NYT_ENG_20071112.0090.LDC2009T13	It also gave her a chance to hit back at the epidemic that affects people she knows.
18466	NYT_ENG_20071112.0090.LDC2009T13	Now when she meets women who have the virus or need treatment for other sexually transmitted infections, she sends them to Dr. Ellen.
18467	NYT_ENG_20071112.0090.LDC2009T13	She kisses her fingers and raises them to the sky when she says, "Dr. Ellen."
18468	NYT_ENG_20071112.0090.LDC2009T13	'It is their challenge'
18469	NYT_ENG_20071112.0090.LDC2009T13	SANTO DOMINGO - Dr. Ellen Koenig, who runs the Instituto Dominicano de Estudios Virologicos, did not set out to be a physician.
18470	NYT_ENG_20071112.0090.LDC2009T13	"The HIV epidemic made me a doctor," she says.
18471	NYT_ENG_20071112.0090.LDC2009T13	Koenig, an American who grew up in Delaware, had a degree in microbiology when she married a Dominican, and he invited her to join him "in paradise," she says.
18472	NYT_ENG_20071112.0090.LDC2009T13	"Then AIDS started."
18473	NYT_ENG_20071112.0090.LDC2009T13	One of her brothers, Dr. Jay Levy, was involved in the earliest work to identify a virus.
18474	NYT_ENG_20071112.0090.LDC2009T13	He suggested that she look for signs of the illness on the island.
18475	NYT_ENG_20071112.0090.LDC2009T13	The blood samples she and a team of local university students gathered later showed the virus was present in the Dominican Republic in the early 1980s.
18476	NYT_ENG_20071112.0090.LDC2009T13	Koenig began to diagnose people with HIV and, frustrated she could do nothing to help them, went to medical school, completing her degree in 1991 at the age of 50.
18477	NYT_ENG_20071112.0090.LDC2009T13	As new medicines to manage AIDS became available, though, only the wealthiest patients could afford them.
18478	NYT_ENG_20071112.0090.LDC2009T13	"We lost a lot of patients because they didn't have the money," the doctor says.
18479	NYT_ENG_20071112.0090.LDC2009T13	"The only way I could see out was clinical trials."
18480	NYT_ENG_20071112.0090.LDC2009T13	The women of MODEMU were willing to help, Koenig says.
18481	NYT_ENG_20071112.0090.LDC2009T13	Women recruited through the group have since participated in a series of vaccine trials.
18482	NYT_ENG_20071112.0090.LDC2009T13	"These are the heroines of today's epidemic.
18483	NYT_ENG_20071112.0090.LDC2009T13	They realize it is their challenge," Koenig says.
18484	NYT_ENG_20071112.0090.LDC2009T13	Like others who have faced the epidemic since its beginnings, she believes a vaccine that either will prevent infection or keep the virus from progressing is the best hope for containing HIV.
18485	NYT_ENG_20071112.0090.LDC2009T13	Then, she says, the women of MODEMU, who have continued to find volunteers, will be proud.
18486	NYT_ENG_20071112.0090.LDC2009T13	"I keep telling them, you one day will say to your children, 'I helped to make that vaccine possible."'
18487	NYT_ENG_20071112.0090.LDC2009T13	Talking 'equal to equal'
18488	NYT_ENG_20071112.0090.LDC2009T13	HAINA - In the meantime, stipends for recruiting and outreach work allowed Jocelyn to buy a stove top, a refrigerator, a television, a couch and two chairs for the crowded apartment where two double beds were the only furniture for seven people.
18489	NYT_ENG_20071112.0090.LDC2009T13	Her friends say her career as a sex worker had slowed to the point that she had not had a customer in four months.
18490	NYT_ENG_20071112.0090.LDC2009T13	Juliana, who through her work with MODEMU recruited some of Koenig's first trial participants, lives with her two children in a solid, tidy two-bedroom house decorated with religious regalia.
18491	NYT_ENG_20071112.0090.LDC2009T13	She says she is retired.
18492	NYT_ENG_20071112.0090.LDC2009T13	She socializes with active sex workers.
18493	NYT_ENG_20071112.0090.LDC2009T13	On a recent visit to the rooms behind the Seaman Bar, she rummaged pointedly through the toiletries cluttering a friend's dresser and, with an expression of satisfaction, held up a condom she found there.
18494	NYT_ENG_20071112.0090.LDC2009T13	She had a beer downstairs with a friend who still works the local prison on visiting days and who fills her straw purse with condoms to give other women working there.
18495	NYT_ENG_20071112.0090.LDC2009T13	She, too, gets stipends for outreach work through MODEMU.
18496	NYT_ENG_20071112.0090.LDC2009T13	With money from the government AIDS office, the group operates locally now from a sparsely equipped office on a noisy corner in the middle of Haina.
18497	NYT_ENG_20071112.0090.LDC2009T13	The office provides vocational and literacy training, as well as outreach workers to connect HIV-infected women with services and to make sure they know that they cannot work anymore.
18498	NYT_ENG_20071112.0090.LDC2009T13	"We talk with the women equal to equal to get across our message.
18499	NYT_ENG_20071112.0090.LDC2009T13	I say 'us' to a sex worker," Juliana says.
18500	NYT_ENG_20071112.0090.LDC2009T13	Many want a better life, she says, pointing to the response she gets when she recruits for vaccine trials.
18501	NYT_ENG_20071112.0090.LDC2009T13	The future she and the others worry about stretches beyond their immediate needs, she says.

18537	NYT_ENG_20071124.0092.LDC2009T13	Hart, a former state legislator with deep roots in Tampa, became president of Workforce Florida in Tallahassee this month.
18538	NYT_ENG_20071124.0092.LDC2009T13	His task?
18539	NYT_ENG_20071124.0092.LDC2009T13	Move the state's workers like they're pieces of a jigsaw puzzle: out of struggling industries and into fields that are growing, better paid and higher skilled.
18540	NYT_ENG_20071124.0092.LDC2009T13	Hart, 39, joins Workforce Florida from Enterprise Florida, another public-private organization aimed at economic development.
18541	NYT_ENG_20071124.0092.LDC2009T13	Here are excerpts from his interview last week with the St. Petersburg Times:
18542	NYT_ENG_20071124.0092.LDC2009T13	Why do we need an agency
18543	NYT_ENG_20071124.0092.LDC2009T13	like Workforce Florida?
18544	NYT_ENG_20071124.0092.LDC2009T13	When a business is looking to come to Florida, the first question they always ask us is about the work force.
18545	NYT_ENG_20071124.0092.LDC2009T13	"What does your work force look like?
18546	NYT_ENG_20071124.0092.LDC2009T13	Are they educated the way I need them to be educated?
18547	NYT_ENG_20071124.0092.LDC2009T13	Do they have the certifications I need?"
18548	NYT_ENG_20071124.0092.LDC2009T13	The way the world used to work, people went where the businesses were.
18549	NYT_ENG_20071124.0092.LDC2009T13	Now, the businesses go where the talent is.
18550	NYT_ENG_20071124.0092.LDC2009T13	Do out-of-state companies worry that Florida's talent is second rate?
18551	NYT_ENG_20071124.0092.LDC2009T13	I don't think we're seen as second rate at all.
18552	NYT_ENG_20071124.0092.LDC2009T13	It isn't (about) trying to bring us up to par with other states and other countries, but to kind of look over the horizon (at demographic changes, emerging industries, etc.) to decipher what training is going to be needed to support the next activity.
18553	NYT_ENG_20071124.0092.LDC2009T13	What are those next big activities?
18554	NYT_ENG_20071124.0092.LDC2009T13	What industries are going to create a lot of jobs here?
18555	NYT_ENG_20071124.0092.LDC2009T13	The energy industry from line workers to plant workers and everything up and down the channel.
18556	NYT_ENG_20071124.0092.LDC2009T13	There are several programs that are already in motion (to train energy workers): There's an Employ Florida Banner Center for energy at Lake-Sumter Community College that got under way this past spring.
18557	NYT_ENG_20071124.0092.LDC2009T13	(The Banner Centers, which Workforce Florida rolled out last year, are state-funded programs that train workers in growing industries like aerospace, biotechnology and manufacturing.)
18558	NYT_ENG_20071124.0092.LDC2009T13	There's also a Banner Center at UCF for alternative energy (in the works).
18559	NYT_ENG_20071124.0092.LDC2009T13	What else?
18560	NYT_ENG_20071124.0092.LDC2009T13	The other area that we're looking at is space.
18561	NYT_ENG_20071124.0092.LDC2009T13	The space shuttle by 2010 will no longer be in existence (according to NASA's plans).
18562	NYT_ENG_20071124.0092.LDC2009T13	The next generation of spacecraft will need fewer workers.
18563	NYT_ENG_20071124.0092.LDC2009T13	That gives us a great opportunity, because we have some of the smartest people they really are rocket scientists who are now available.
18564	NYT_ENG_20071124.0092.LDC2009T13	What are you going to
18565	NYT_ENG_20071124.0092.LDC2009T13	do with all those rocket
18566	NYT_ENG_20071124.0092.LDC2009T13	scientists?
18567	NYT_ENG_20071124.0092.LDC2009T13	We're working with Enterprise Florida and Space Florida they can help point out what businesses they (the scientists) can go to.
18568	NYT_ENG_20071124.0092.LDC2009T13	What about the Tampa Bay area's work force?
18569	NYT_ENG_20071124.0092.LDC2009T13	What's

18572	NYT_ENG_20071124.0092.LDC2009T13	I see the University of South Florida and Moffitt Cancer Center and the fact that you have a lot of technology entrepreneurs.

18574	NYT_ENG_20071124.0092.LDC2009T13	they're going to need some of the best and brightest, they're going to need lab technicians, chemists and engineers.
18575	NYT_ENG_20071124.0092.LDC2009T13	Do we really have that
18576	NYT_ENG_20071124.0092.LDC2009T13	kind of talent here?

18581	NYT_ENG_20071124.0092.LDC2009T13	Florida is steadily losing jobs in manufacturing.
18582	NYT_ENG_20071124.0092.LDC2009T13	Does that bother you, or would you say 'good riddance'?
18583	NYT_ENG_20071124.0092.LDC2009T13	I'd like to see a renewed interest in the state in manufacturing, but it's a clean manufacturing, a research and development manufacturing, not an easily copied type of manufacturing.
18584	NYT_ENG_20071124.0092.LDC2009T13	What do you mean by 'research and development manufacturing'?
18585	NYT_ENG_20071124.0092.LDC2009T13	Manufacturing new products and new processes.
18586	NYT_ENG_20071124.0092.LDC2009T13	So mainly, those workers who are working to develop a new drug, or a new medical device.
18587	NYT_ENG_20071124.0092.LDC2009T13	They would be manufacturing that not for mass distribution, because once you get to that point you've mechanized the process and that's something that you can bid on price a lot of that is probably being done offshore.
18588	NYT_ENG_20071124.0092.LDC2009T13	You keep talking about knowledge-driven jobs.

18592	NYT_ENG_20071124.0092.LDC2009T13	Some people say they want those jobs to disappear, but tourism and agriculture are lifeblood in this state, and have been since the beginning of Florida's existence.
18593	NYT_ENG_20071124.0092.LDC2009T13	They do provide a lot of jobs, directly and indirectly.

18619	NYT_ENG_20071202.0121.LDC2009T13	Say what you will about Judith Regan -- most people have -- she knows her way around a rip-roaring read.
18620	NYT_ENG_20071202.0121.LDC2009T13	The complaint in her $100 million civil suit against the News Corp., with its riveting passages about corporate connivance, public malfeasance and ill- fated romance, is as much a page-turner as any of the dozens of salacious best sellers she produced at ReganBooks, her imprint at HarperCollins before she was fired at the end of last year.
18621	NYT_ENG_20071202.0121.LDC2009T13	But the deeper I went in the complaint, the more I felt I had read this book before.
18622	NYT_ENG_20071202.0121.LDC2009T13	The narrative -- about a talented but unpredictable impresario who joined forces with a media company with a great deal of fanfare before a huge, ugly divorce -- mirrored the confrontation between Rosie O'Donnell and Gruner &amp

18627	NYT_ENG_20071202.0121.LDC2009T13	Jahr that sued O'Donnell on the grounds of breach of contract, while Regan is the one doing the suing, claiming that she had been defamed by News Corp. officials -- but they are instructive, especially for the News Corp.
18628	NYT_ENG_20071202.0121.LDC2009T13	In the case of O'Donnell, it was her insistence on making sure that the old McCall's magazine, renamed Rosie, reflected her take on the world, including putting herself on the cover with an upraised and bandaged middle finger to depict her fight against a staph infection.
18629	NYT_ENG_20071202.0121.LDC2009T13	Regan, who asserted in her suit that she had sold more than $1 billion worth of books, was fired after her plans to publish a hypothetical confession from O.J.

18630	NYT_ENG_20071202.0121.LDC2009T13	Both O'Donnell and Regan entertained settlement discussions before deciding to press on, in part because they could not abide by nondisclosure agreements.

18636	NYT_ENG_20071202.0121.LDC2009T13	Still, what seems like a nuisance can become a significant problem in court.
18637	NYT_ENG_20071202.0121.LDC2009T13	The News Corp., a tough outfit that does not embarrass or scare easily, would still seem to have a lot more to lose than Regan.
18638	NYT_ENG_20071202.0121.LDC2009T13	Much continues to be made of the fact that Regan is sitting on explosive allegations about Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York and a presidential candidate.
18639	NYT_ENG_20071202.0121.LDC2009T13	In her lawsuit, she claims that she was encouraged to lie by a News Corp. official about the activities of Bernard B.

18640	NYT_ENG_20071202.0121.LDC2009T13	She further said the company had delivered on a promise to systematically smear her reputation if she did not go along.
18641	NYT_ENG_20071202.0121.LDC2009T13	News Corp. officials point out that Rupert Murdoch has never been a supporter of Giuliani and describe the accusation as silly, but Regan steadfastly maintains that she has the goods to support her allegations.
18642	NYT_ENG_20071202.0121.LDC2009T13	"Judith Regan would not have brought this lawsuit unless she had explicit, unambiguous evidence to back it up," said a spokesman on her behalf.
18643	NYT_ENG_20071202.0121.LDC2009T13	Of course, you can say anything in a lawsuit, and Regan remains coy about the exact nature of the accusations.
18644	NYT_ENG_20071202.0121.LDC2009T13	A spokesman for the News Corp. pointed out that the case was a long way from a trial and added that the company was "highly dismissive of her complaint and the company will vigorously defend itself in this action."

18649	NYT_ENG_20071202.0121.LDC2009T13	It was a field day for working reporters (I was one of them), with mud and tears flying in all directions before the presiding judge decided to put a pox on both their houses and gave each side nothing.

18659	NYT_ENG_20071202.0121.LDC2009T13	"You have to consider the financial exposure versus the reputational exposure of not settling."
18660	NYT_ENG_20071202.0121.LDC2009T13	Regan, perhaps more so than O'Donnell, has a penchant for aggression matched only by a knack for surprises.
18661	NYT_ENG_20071202.0121.LDC2009T13	After it became apparent that the public found the idea of the Simpson book and an accompanying interview abhorrent, she suggested that as a victim of abuse, she had decided to "sit face to face with the killer, because I wanted him, and the other men who broke my heart and your hearts, to tell the truth, to confess their sins, to do penance."
18662	NYT_ENG_20071202.0121.LDC2009T13	Those religious motifs were on display more recently in a short as-told-to article in Harper's Bazaar in which she posed as St. Sebastian, replete with bloody arrows accessorizing a fetching white gown.

18666	NYT_ENG_20071202.0121.LDC2009T13	I don't know, whatever the reason, it disappointed me to the bone and broke my heart."
18667	NYT_ENG_20071202.0121.LDC2009T13	Regan's profound public woundedness has her healing on a number of fronts, including calling on her former training in the Vassar Madrigals to record a version of "My Way."

18678	NYT_ENG_20071209.0046.LDC2009T13	Hey, do you mind if we take a whack at this business about "intelligent design" vs. "evolution"?
18679	NYT_ENG_20071209.0046.LDC2009T13	The debate flared up again in Florida last week.
18680	NYT_ENG_20071209.0046.LDC2009T13	Here's my fix.
18681	NYT_ENG_20071209.0046.LDC2009T13	They're not opposite things.
18682	NYT_ENG_20071209.0046.LDC2009T13	They are entirely separate matters.
18683	NYT_ENG_20071209.0046.LDC2009T13	Let's deal with them separately.
18684	NYT_ENG_20071209.0046.LDC2009T13	So if you say you want to "teach intelligent design" in the public schools, hey, that's fine by me, up to a point.
18685	NYT_ENG_20071209.0046.LDC2009T13	I would address it in a few paragraphs early on about the kinds of things that people believe.
18686	NYT_ENG_20071209.0046.LDC2009T13	I would say that lots of people believe that our universe has a creator, and a purpose.
18687	NYT_ENG_20071209.0046.LDC2009T13	For further info, I would say, check out the religion of your choice, if you choose one.
18688	NYT_ENG_20071209.0046.LDC2009T13	And if you don't, and don't believe that, that's fine too this is a public school, and we are not taking sides here.
18689	NYT_ENG_20071209.0046.LDC2009T13	You want more than that?
18690	NYT_ENG_20071209.0046.LDC2009T13	Okeydoke.
18691	NYT_ENG_20071209.0046.LDC2009T13	We could also throw in the part about how some people believe the universe is too complicated to have occurred by accident.
18692	NYT_ENG_20071209.0046.LDC2009T13	Eyeballs, brains, cell nuclei, all of that kind of stuff.
18693	NYT_ENG_20071209.0046.LDC2009T13	That's perfectly true, too.
18694	NYT_ENG_20071209.0046.LDC2009T13	I mean, it's true that lots of people make that argument.
18695	NYT_ENG_20071209.0046.LDC2009T13	As to whether we can ever settle the argument, beats me.
18696	NYT_ENG_20071209.0046.LDC2009T13	Now we come to the unrelated "evolution" part of the science curriculum, and here is what I would teach:
18697	NYT_ENG_20071209.0046.LDC2009T13	No matter how the world came into being, as best we can tell, life here on Earth has changed over long periods of time.
18698	NYT_ENG_20071209.0046.LDC2009T13	It's a fact.
18699	NYT_ENG_20071209.0046.LDC2009T13	We know it.
18700	NYT_ENG_20071209.0046.LDC2009T13	We have dug it up.
18701	NYT_ENG_20071209.0046.LDC2009T13	We have taken a good gander at it.
18702	NYT_ENG_20071209.0046.LDC2009T13	Lots of guys who looked kind of like us, but who weren't us, used to walk around.
18703	NYT_ENG_20071209.0046.LDC2009T13	Lots of old stuff is gone.
18704	NYT_ENG_20071209.0046.LDC2009T13	Lots of new stuff is here.
18705	NYT_ENG_20071209.0046.LDC2009T13	Saying this is not an attack on religion.
18706	NYT_ENG_20071209.0046.LDC2009T13	It has nothing to say about whether God created the universe.
18707	NYT_ENG_20071209.0046.LDC2009T13	Nothing.
18708	NYT_ENG_20071209.0046.LDC2009T13	Zippo.
18709	NYT_ENG_20071209.0046.LDC2009T13	It's just as silly to use science to deny God as it is to use faith to deny science.
18710	NYT_ENG_20071209.0046.LDC2009T13	And yet, if you are still determined to have a fight, you could say:
18711	NYT_ENG_20071209.0046.LDC2009T13	"The book of Genesis tells me that God fashioned man out of clay and made the world in six days.
18712	NYT_ENG_20071209.0046.LDC2009T13	But evolution says that man came about gradually.
18713	NYT_ENG_20071209.0046.LDC2009T13	So there's a conflict."
18714	NYT_ENG_20071209.0046.LDC2009T13	Nah.
18715	NYT_ENG_20071209.0046.LDC2009T13	I still don't think there is a conflict.
18716	NYT_ENG_20071209.0046.LDC2009T13	I am figuring that God could have made the world any way that he wanted.
18717	NYT_ENG_20071209.0046.LDC2009T13	But if you have a different inside scoop, and you are certain that a blink of God's eye is not a million years to us, or 10- million, or a 100-million, then you are an expert, and you need to get on TV and charge good money for it.
18718	NYT_ENG_20071209.0046.LDC2009T13	Here is my favorite part of the Old Testament: the part where Job demands to know God's ways, and God rebukes him for his presumption.
18719	NYT_ENG_20071209.0046.LDC2009T13	Canst thou draw out Leviathan with a hook?
18720	NYT_ENG_20071209.0046.LDC2009T13	Hoo boy!
18721	NYT_ENG_20071209.0046.LDC2009T13	Sorry.
18722	NYT_ENG_20071209.0046.LDC2009T13	Let's get back to the schoolroom.
18723	NYT_ENG_20071209.0046.LDC2009T13	If this lesson plan is still not good enough for you, then at the end we could always throw in this warning:
18724	NYT_ENG_20071209.0046.LDC2009T13	"Look, evolution does not have anything to do with what people believe about God.
18725	NYT_ENG_20071209.0046.LDC2009T13	All this theory does is try to explain the changes that we have observed."
18726	NYT_ENG_20071209.0046.LDC2009T13	Now, for the last objection:
18727	NYT_ENG_20071209.0046.LDC2009T13	"How can you prove, Mr. Smarty Pants, that God didn't create the world just a few thousand years ago, complete with fossils and all?"
18728	NYT_ENG_20071209.0046.LDC2009T13	I can't.
18729	NYT_ENG_20071209.0046.LDC2009T13	But neither can I prove that God didn't create the world 10 seconds ago.
18730	NYT_ENG_20071209.0046.LDC2009T13	In the end, see, you still gotta go with the measuring sticks that you have.
18731	NYT_ENG_20071212.0005.LDC2009T13	NFL AND PLAYERS UNION AGREE TO ALTER DISABILITY PLAN PAT BORZI CONTRIBUTED REPORTING FROM MINNEAPOLIS.
18732	NYT_ENG_20071212.0005.LDC2009T13	The National Football League and the NFL Players Association, which have been criticized by some former players for their treatment of retired and disabled players, are changing the disability plan with the hope it will streamline the process for players seeking disability payments.
18733	NYT_ENG_20071212.0005.LDC2009T13	In recent months, several former players have complained that the process is bogged down in red tape and the system simply does not work.
18734	NYT_ENG_20071212.0005.LDC2009T13	Gene Upshaw, the executive director of the union, said in an interview Tuesday that the players association hired an outside company to conduct a review.
18735	NYT_ENG_20071212.0005.LDC2009T13	The changes he outlined Tuesday were a result.
18736	NYT_ENG_20071212.0005.LDC2009T13	Those changes include:
18737	NYT_ENG_20071212.0005.LDC2009T13	-- The addition of a medical director to advise the two-person initial claims committee.
18738	NYT_ENG_20071212.0005.LDC2009T13	-- The addition of doctors panels in major metropolitan areas, especially in California, Arizona, Texas and Florida, that would allow a player to see the appropriate specialist in a more timely manner.
18739	NYT_ENG_20071212.0005.LDC2009T13	-- The addition of a claims specialist to walk players through the application process over the phone, an effort to reduce the number of claims with wrong or missing information.
18740	NYT_ENG_20071212.0005.LDC2009T13	-- Allowing trustees to vote by electronic ballot on claims appeals that arise between their normal quarterly meetings.
18741	NYT_ENG_20071212.0005.LDC2009T13	-- Extending the review period to every five years from three for cases in which a player is deemed to be totally and permanently disabled to determine if a player still qualifies for benefits.
18742	NYT_ENG_20071212.0005.LDC2009T13	-- Providing all retired vested players with a prescription drug card for discounted medication.
18743	NYT_ENG_20071212.0005.LDC2009T13	Upshaw said the changes would be immediate.
18744	NYT_ENG_20071212.0005.LDC2009T13	"These six things address a lot of the administrative process that had delays built into it," said Harold Henderson, the executive vice president-player programs for the NFL Management Council.
18745	NYT_ENG_20071212.0005.LDC2009T13	"It expedites it.
18746	NYT_ENG_20071212.0005.LDC2009T13	It gets to a quicker and less burdensome decision."
18747	NYT_ENG_20071212.0005.LDC2009T13	The former Bears player and coach Mike Ditka, who has been one of the most outspoken critics of the plan, said he hoped to learn more details, but when he was told of the changes during an appearance in Minneapolis on Tuesday, he was delighted.
18748	NYT_ENG_20071212.0005.LDC2009T13	"Terrific," Ditka said.
18749	NYT_ENG_20071212.0005.LDC2009T13	"That's the greatest thing in the world.
18750	NYT_ENG_20071212.0005.LDC2009T13	Get rid of the red tape.
18751	NYT_ENG_20071212.0005.LDC2009T13	If they do that, that's the greatest thing in the world."
18752	NYT_ENG_20071212.0005.LDC2009T13	This is the second initiative in as many days by the league and the union that represents players.
18753	NYT_ENG_20071212.0005.LDC2009T13	On Monday the parties said that 14 medical centers had been selected to help players in need of joint replacements.
18754	NYT_ENG_20071212.0005.LDC2009T13	Despite the planned changes, difficult decisions remain about who qualifies for disability.
18755	NYT_ENG_20071212.0005.LDC2009T13	Since 1993, Upshaw said, 1,052 former players have applied for disability and 428 were approved.
18756	NYT_ENG_20071212.0005.LDC2009T13	Players are denied for three reasons: They do not meet the disability standards, they are not vested or they are already drawing a pension.
18757	NYT_ENG_20071212.0005.LDC2009T13	Players must be on a roster for three games a season to get a vesting credit and vesting requires three credited seasons for players who came into the league after 1992, four seasons for those in the league from 1973 to 1992 and five seasons for those out of the league before 1973.
18758	NYT_ENG_20071212.0005.LDC2009T13	"I don't really believe we have a long way to go," Upshaw said.
18759	NYT_ENG_20071212.0005.LDC2009T13	"This is a significant step.
18760	NYT_ENG_20071212.0005.LDC2009T13	It might not sound like much, but it is a lot.
18761	NYT_ENG_20071212.0005.LDC2009T13	The criticism is what it is.
18762	NYT_ENG_20071212.0005.LDC2009T13	It's just noise.
18763	NYT_ENG_20071212.0005.LDC2009T13	We're never going to turn the disability plan into a welfare state."

18765	NYT_ENG_20071215.0082.LDC2009T13	GOMA, Congo
18766	NYT_ENG_20071215.0082.LDC2009T13	Frustration at the U.N. peacekeeping force and the dozens of aid organizations working in North Kivu province, in eastern Congo, is rising as violence increases, the number of displaced people here creeps toward 1 million, and the pace of assistance, especially to those fleeing the fighting in the past few weeks, lags.
18767	NYT_ENG_20071215.0082.LDC2009T13	Many Congolese want the U.N. peacekeepers to intervene more forcefully and fight beside the Congolese army against the rebel forces of Laurent Nkunda, a renegade general who refuses to merge his troops into the national armed forces.
18768	NYT_ENG_20071215.0082.LDC2009T13	The fight against Nkunda has pushed Congo to the brink of a new civil war, a year after the first elected government in four decades took office and four years after fighting officially ended.
18769	NYT_ENG_20071215.0082.LDC2009T13	Congo's army has proved unable to beat back the rebels, and the fighting in the past year has displaced 425,000 people.
18770	NYT_ENG_20071215.0082.LDC2009T13	The U.N. force has a strong mandate in Congo to use force to protect civilians, and it has pledged to defend Goma and the camps around it from being overrun by rebels.
18771	NYT_ENG_20071215.0082.LDC2009T13	It is also required to work with the Congolese army to establish security, which has led to the expectation in a population weary from more than a decade of conflict that the U.N. force here, known by its acronym, MONUC, would help defeat the rebels.
18772	NYT_ENG_20071215.0082.LDC2009T13	"Why is MONUC here, if not to fight these people who make us suffer?"
18773	NYT_ENG_20071215.0082.LDC2009T13	said Mwenge Biroto, who fled Sake on Tuesday.
18774	NYT_ENG_20071215.0082.LDC2009T13	"Why don't they help us get peace?"
18775	NYT_ENG_20071215.0082.LDC2009T13	Diplomats from several Western countries have also questioned why MONUC has not acted more forcefully to prevent civilians from having to flee in the first place, an issue that is likely to come up as diplomats gather here this weekend to discuss regional security.
18776	NYT_ENG_20071215.0082.LDC2009T13	The force's mandate is up for renewal in the Security Council this month.
18777	NYT_ENG_20071215.0082.LDC2009T13	U.N. officials say that their role is to help the Congo's government, not take its place, and that protecting civilians is mainly the government's responsibility.
18778	NYT_ENG_20071215.0082.LDC2009T13	The United Nations has provided transportation for troop movements and some helicopter air support to the government's unsuccessful efforts to remove Nkunda.
18779	NYT_ENG_20071215.0082.LDC2009T13	Congolese frustration with the U.N. force is more than matched by anger at its own military, which retreated in the face of rebel attacks last week.
18780	NYT_ENG_20071215.0082.LDC2009T13	Brig. Gen. Indrajeet Narayan, the commander of the 4,500 peacekeeping troops deployed in North Kivu, said the force was not authorized to go any further unless it was under attack.
18781	NYT_ENG_20071215.0082.LDC2009T13	"There is a lot of expectation" from civilians, Narayan said.
18782	NYT_ENG_20071215.0082.LDC2009T13	"They see our troops, they see our weaponry, so they expect this should be used.
18783	NYT_ENG_20071215.0082.LDC2009T13	However, the mandate clearly sates that we have to protect the civilian population
18784	NYT_ENG_20071215.0082.LDC2009T13	that is foremost."
18785	NYT_ENG_20071215.0082.LDC2009T13	The United Nations also has serious human rights concerns in working too closely with the Congolese military, which has struggled, largely unsuccessfully, to maintain discipline and morale.
18786	NYT_ENG_20071215.0082.LDC2009T13	The army is mostly composed of former members of the old national army and militias who fought in the civil war.
18787	NYT_ENG_20071215.0082.LDC2009T13	They have been retrained and redeployed, but problems have continued, and the army has been accused of many human rights violations, including murder and rape.
18788	NYT_ENG_20071215.0082.LDC2009T13	Human rights organizations and aid workers say that the army sometimes collaborates with militias, like the Mai Mai.
18789	NYT_ENG_20071215.0082.LDC2009T13	Last week, the 14th Brigade, which the rebels chased out of Mushake, harassed civilians and looted as it left, drawing censure from the United Nations.
18790	NYT_ENG_20071215.0082.LDC2009T13	Many Congolese are also frustrated with aid organizations, many of which began to scale back emergency programs after last year's election to focus more on long-and medium-term development, the brick-and-mortar projects, like schools, clinics and water systems, needed to rebuild a shattered country.
18791	NYT_ENG_20071215.0082.LDC2009T13	They are struggling to keep up with the surge in demand for basic supplies, like food and shelter, for the endless river of displaced people, and work amid the violence.
18792	NYT_ENG_20071215.0082.LDC2009T13	Hunger and disease, not bullets and bombs, have always been the primary killers in Congo, where some researchers estimate 4 million have died since the war began in 1996.
18793	NYT_ENG_20071215.0082.LDC2009T13	People on the run often crowd in with relatives in provincial towns to avoid the refugee camps.
18794	NYT_ENG_20071215.0082.LDC2009T13	But this practice can make them more vulnerable to disease -- most camps have clean water and latrines.
18795	NYT_ENG_20071215.0082.LDC2009T13	In Rutshuru, a large regional town, a cholera epidemic brings 50 people daily to a hospital run by Doctors Without Borders.
18796	NYT_ENG_20071215.0082.LDC2009T13	Cholera is a grim byproduct of displacement.
18797	NYT_ENG_20071215.0082.LDC2009T13	When rural people flock to cities, they take cholera with them.
18798	NYT_ENG_20071215.0082.LDC2009T13	In crowded and unsanitary conditions, it spreads like wildfire, said Augustin Augier, the hospital's coordinator.
18799	NYT_ENG_20071215.0082.LDC2009T13	"The violence and disease are completely connected," Augier said.
18800	NYT_ENG_20071215.0082.LDC2009T13	"We have never seen a cholera epidemic in Rutshuru
18801	NYT_ENG_20071215.0082.LDC2009T13	it is only as a result of the crisis."
18802	NYT_ENG_20071215.0082.LDC2009T13	The hospital set up a cholera ward, and a workshop to build cots.
18803	NYT_ENG_20071215.0082.LDC2009T13	Speed is essential.
18804	NYT_ENG_20071215.0082.LDC2009T13	Caught early, cholera is treatable -- no medicine is needed, just copious infusions of intravenous fluids.
18805	NYT_ENG_20071215.0082.LDC2009T13	But left untreated, it kills half of its victims, sometimes in a day.
18806	NYT_ENG_20071215.0082.LDC2009T13	Getting food to the displaced has been a problem, in part because they move so quickly, often outpacing lumbering aid bureaucracies.
18807	NYT_ENG_20071215.0082.LDC2009T13	Security concerns and rutted, mud-choked roads have made it difficult to move supplies.
18808	NYT_ENG_20071215.0082.LDC2009T13	Recent clashes forced the World Food Program to suspend deliveries to areas where more than 350,000 displaced people lived.
18809	NYT_ENG_20071215.0082.LDC2009T13	Even when populations can return, they cannot farm because of roaming armed groups.
18810	NYT_ENG_20071215.0082.LDC2009T13	Rebels and army soldiers alike, aid and human rights workers say, rape women who leave their villages to farm.
18811	NYT_ENG_20071215.0082.LDC2009T13	Child malnutrition is rising, and displaced people are forced to flee with no food, leaving them dependent on handouts.
18812	NYT_ENG_20071215.0082.LDC2009T13	In Minova, a town where dozens of ragged, exhausted families arrived last week seeking refuge, Cadre, a local aid organization, opened a spare building where it usually offers sewing classes as a shelter from the driving rain.
18813	NYT_ENG_20071215.0082.LDC2009T13	"We really don't have anything to offer them -- no food, nothing to make shelter," said Edouard Dunia, who leads Cadre.

18819	NYT_ENG_20071217.0036.LDC2009T13	SEOUL, South Korea
18820	NYT_ENG_20071217.0036.LDC2009T13	What had appeared to be a one-horse race for the presidential election in South Korea on Wednesday turned less predictable on Monday when Parliament voted to open an independent investigation into allegations of fraud against Lee Myung-bak, the front-runner and candidate of the opposition Grand National Party.
18821	NYT_ENG_20071217.0036.LDC2009T13	Polling experts predicted that the vote to open the investigation was unlikely to derail the conservative politician's ride to victory.
18822	NYT_ENG_20071217.0036.LDC2009T13	But they said the problem highlighted a question facing voters, many of whom are still undecided -- which is more important in a president: high ethical standards or an ability to manage the economy?
18823	NYT_ENG_20071217.0036.LDC2009T13	It is a question that South Koreans will grapple with long after the election.
18824	NYT_ENG_20071217.0036.LDC2009T13	Even if Lee wins, he will have undergone the humiliation of being the first South Korean president-elect to face a criminal investigation, and a possible indictment.
18825	NYT_ENG_20071217.0036.LDC2009T13	The parliamentary move came a day after a video surfaced of a university lecture Lee gave in 2000, in which he appears to be claiming he founded an investment company that is now at the center of stock manipulation charges.
18826	NYT_ENG_20071217.0036.LDC2009T13	Lee has denied any involvement with the company, BBK.
18827	NYT_ENG_20071217.0036.LDC2009T13	On Monday, he said that he had made "some incorrect statements" in the lecture.
18828	NYT_ENG_20071217.0036.LDC2009T13	Denying again that he established the company, he said he had "not a speck of guilt concerning BBK."
18829	NYT_ENG_20071217.0036.LDC2009T13	"In this election, our nation will decide whether to take a leap forward or stay where we are," Lee said in a televised campaign speech on Monday.
18830	NYT_ENG_20071217.0036.LDC2009T13	"We should move from the negative politics of slandering each other to the positive politics of embracing each other."
18831	NYT_ENG_20071217.0036.LDC2009T13	Lee, who turns 66 on Wednesday, has been hounded by questions about his ethics.
18832	NYT_ENG_20071217.0036.LDC2009T13	But South Koreans have rallied behind him -- some tired of the two successive liberal governments and others on a belief that Lee, a former star executive at Hyundai, one of South Korea's best known conglomerates, could help revive the economy.
18833	NYT_ENG_20071217.0036.LDC2009T13	In the last opinion polls, released Thursday, Lee was pulling ahead with an almost 30 percentage-point lead over his closest rival.
18834	NYT_ENG_20071217.0036.LDC2009T13	By law, no survey results can be published in the final week of campaigning.
18835	NYT_ENG_20071217.0036.LDC2009T13	Polling experts said that although the video highlighted Lee's vulnerabilities, it may have come too late to reverse the outcome of the race.
18836	NYT_ENG_20071217.0036.LDC2009T13	However, they said it appeared unlikely that Lee would win with a majority of the vote.
18837	NYT_ENG_20071217.0036.LDC2009T13	"It's mind-boggling to imagine what will happen if the special prosecutor finds Mr. Lee guilty and indicts him," said Kim Neung Gou, head of Wincom Communication, a political consultancy in Seoul.
18838	NYT_ENG_20071217.0036.LDC2009T13	"Even if he is cleared legally, the damage to his moral authority will dog him as long as he stays in office."
18839	NYT_ENG_20071217.0036.LDC2009T13	South Korea has never seen anything like Lee's situation.
18840	NYT_ENG_20071217.0036.LDC2009T13	Legal experts remain divided as to whether a president can stand trial on charges filed while he is president-elect.
18841	NYT_ENG_20071217.0036.LDC2009T13	Under the South Korean Constitution, a sitting president is immune from prosecution unless he is charged with treason.
18842	NYT_ENG_20071217.0036.LDC2009T13	Under the bill passed by the National Assembly on Monday, the independent prosecutor must complete his investigation within 40 days, or, in other words, before the winner of the election on Wednesday takes office on Feb. 25.
18843	NYT_ENG_20071217.0036.LDC2009T13	For days, rival legislators chanting "Lee Myung-bak for president!"
18844	NYT_ENG_20071217.0036.LDC2009T13	or "Lee Myung-bak, liar!"
18845	NYT_ENG_20071217.0036.LDC2009T13	had been trading blows during the parliamentary debate over the bill.
18846	NYT_ENG_20071217.0036.LDC2009T13	The independent prosecutor will investigate whether Lee set up BBK and was the mastermind behind stock manipulation and embezzlement by a Korean-American businessman named Kim Kyung Joon.
18847	NYT_ENG_20071217.0036.LDC2009T13	This month, state prosecutors indicted Kim but cleared Lee, boosting Lee's popularity in opinion polls.
18848	NYT_ENG_20071217.0036.LDC2009T13	But in the same surveys, a majority of respondents said they were dissatisfied with the prosecutors' report.
18849	NYT_ENG_20071217.0036.LDC2009T13	"Voting for Lee is the same as voting for a lie," said Chung Dong-young, the main pro-government liberal candidate running a distant second in recent opinion polls.
18850	NYT_ENG_20071217.0036.LDC2009T13	He called Lee "a second Nixon and a second Thaksin," referring to the former American and Thai leaders who were forced out of office.
18851	NYT_ENG_20071217.0036.LDC2009T13	Chung predicted that South Korea would face a "likely re- election" if Lee wins the poll Wednesday.
18852	NYT_ENG_20071217.0036.LDC2009T13	For many, Lee epitomizes the country's proud rags-to-riches rise from the ashes of the Korean War to become the world's 13th- largest economy.
18853	NYT_ENG_20071217.0036.LDC2009T13	A son of a family too poor to send him to college, Lee ran away to Seoul and finished college while working as a garbage collector.
18854	NYT_ENG_20071217.0036.LDC2009T13	From an unheard-of age of 36, he led six affiliates of Hyundai, which became the country's largest conglomerate and icon of its rapid industrialization during his tenure.
18855	NYT_ENG_20071217.0036.LDC2009T13	But Lee also reminded people of another side of some of their country's big-business executives, whose success people suspect was built partly on corruption.
18856	NYT_ENG_20071217.0036.LDC2009T13	Lee recently apologized for using false addresses in the 1980s in order to enroll his children in better schools and for putting two of them on the payroll of his company, even though at least one of them never worked there.
18857	NYT_ENG_20071217.0036.LDC2009T13	Still, many voters are supporting Lee as a reaction against the incumbent President Roh Moo-hyun, experts said.
18858	NYT_ENG_20071217.0036.LDC2009T13	Although Roh is largely considered ethically cleaner than his predecessor, he has irritated people by focusing on issues like how to deal with North Korea, while most people were more preoccupied with soaring housing prices.
18859	NYT_ENG_20071217.0036.LDC2009T13	Meanwhile, Lee, who was mayor of Seoul from 2002 to 2006, built his pragmatic image with improvements like renovating city parks and easing traffic jams.

18861	NYT_ENG_20071218.0248.LDC2009T13	Federal prosecutors charged the former outside counsel for the bankrupt commodities brokerage firm Refco on Tuesday with fraud tied to the eventual collapse of the commodities and futures brokerage.
18862	NYT_ENG_20071218.0248.LDC2009T13	Joseph P. Collins, 57, of the law firm Mayer Brown, faces 11 counts including securities fraud, wire fraud and filing false statements with federal regulators.
18863	NYT_ENG_20071218.0248.LDC2009T13	Separately, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed a civil suit against Collins on Tuesday.
18864	NYT_ENG_20071218.0248.LDC2009T13	"Mr. Collins' role in this fraud was vital," Michael J. Garcia, the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, said at a news conference.
18865	NYT_ENG_20071218.0248.LDC2009T13	It is rare for outside counsel to be charged for fraud supposedly committed by their clients
18866	NYT_ENG_20071218.0248.LDC2009T13	not even Enron's outside lawyers faced criminal charges.
18867	NYT_ENG_20071218.0248.LDC2009T13	"Joe Collins is an innocent victim of the Refco fraud," Collins' lawyer, William Schwartz, said in a statement.
18868	NYT_ENG_20071218.0248.LDC2009T13	"This indictment should send a chill down the spine of every transactional lawyer who believes he or she is representing an honest client."
18869	NYT_ENG_20071218.0248.LDC2009T13	But Garcia said that the charges did not signal a new trend of prosecuting outside lawyers.
18870	NYT_ENG_20071218.0248.LDC2009T13	"The vast majority of outside counsel is law-abiding," he said.
18871	NYT_ENG_20071218.0248.LDC2009T13	The announcement is the latest twist in the two-year-old fraud case, which arose in the wake of Refco's demise.
18872	NYT_ENG_20071218.0248.LDC2009T13	Once one of the world's largest commodities brokerage firms, Refco went public in 2005, only to begin crumbling two months later after it disclosed that Philip R. Bennett, then its chief executive, had hidden $430 million in loans owed to the company.
18873	NYT_ENG_20071218.0248.LDC2009T13	Prosecutors say that Collins, who oversaw Mayer Brown's work for Refco from the mid-1990s to 2005, supervised the structuring of transactions in which Refco temporarily shuffled debt to related companies and third parties.
18874	NYT_ENG_20071218.0248.LDC2009T13	Those loans were reversed shortly after Refco's quarterly periods ended.
18875	NYT_ENG_20071218.0248.LDC2009T13	Collins also drafted documents that misrepresented that debt to Thomas H. Lee Partners, the private equity firm that bought a stake in the company in 2004, and to the SEC before Refco went public, according to the complaint.
18876	NYT_ENG_20071218.0248.LDC2009T13	Bennett, who has pleaded not guilty to fraud charges, is scheduled to go on trial next year.
18877	NYT_ENG_20071218.0248.LDC2009T13	Others facing criminal charges include Robert C. Trosten, Refco's former chief financial officer, and Tone N. Grant, the firm's former president.

18880	NYT_ENG_20071218.0248.LDC2009T13	Maw, said in a statement that Collins was on leave and that the firm was cooperating with federal authorities.
18881	NYT_ENG_20071218.0248.LDC2009T13	It is facing lawsuits by trusts representing Refco's creditors.
18882	NYT_ENG_20071218.0248.LDC2009T13	"Our review of the evidence available to us shows that the firm acted in a professional, competent and ethical manner in its work on behalf of Refco," Mayer Brown said in its statement.
18883	NYT_ENG_20071226.0223.LDC2009T13	CONFUSION AT SAN FRANCISCO ZOO AS TIGER WENT ON DEADLY RAMPAGE M. VEGA
18884	NYT_ENG_20071226.0223.LDC2009T13	San Francisco -- It was nightmare of carnage and confusion, with police attempting to find an escaped tiger that fatally mauled one San Francisco Zoo visitor and then apparently followed a trail of blood across the zoo to attack two of his friends.
18885	NYT_ENG_20071226.0223.LDC2009T13	When police arrived at the zoo on Christmas evening, they were hampered by a lack of emergency lights, video surveillance cameras and maps.
18886	NYT_ENG_20071226.0223.LDC2009T13	They didn't know how many animals might be on the loose or how many victims might have been injured.
18887	NYT_ENG_20071226.0223.LDC2009T13	The minimal evidence found at the scene included a shoe and blood in the 25-foot-wide moat that surrounds the tigers' grotto, raising questions about what role, if any, the victims might have had in accidentally helping the animal escape.
18888	NYT_ENG_20071226.0223.LDC2009T13	The three victims, all young men from San Jose, were visiting the zoo together.
18889	NYT_ENG_20071226.0223.LDC2009T13	They were each present when the tiger escaped, killed 17-year-old Carlos Sousa Jr. with a savage slash to the throat, and injured the other two.
18890	NYT_ENG_20071226.0223.LDC2009T13	The names of the survivors, who are brothers ages 19 and 23, have not been released by authorities.
18891	NYT_ENG_20071226.0223.LDC2009T13	The injured victims fled, and the tiger apparently followed them under rapidly darkening skies for 300 yards down a zoo pathway.
18892	NYT_ENG_20071226.0223.LDC2009T13	As the tiger cornered and attacked one of the brothers, four police officers arrived, distracted the animal and shot it dead.
18893	NYT_ENG_20071226.0223.LDC2009T13	Zoo officials said they are trying to figure out how the 4-year- old Siberian tiger named Tatiana escaped from her enclosure shortly after the zoo's 5 p.m. closing time.
18894	NYT_ENG_20071226.0223.LDC2009T13	No doors to the grotto had been left ajar, they said.
18895	NYT_ENG_20071226.0223.LDC2009T13	The animal is the same one who attacked a zookeeper almost exactly a year ago.
18896	NYT_ENG_20071226.0223.LDC2009T13	Officials speculated that one of the victims may have been dangling a leg or other body part over the 14-foot grotto wall and that Tatiana latched onto the limb and climbed out.
18897	NYT_ENG_20071226.0223.LDC2009T13	Police sources said a footprint had been found on a metal fence, suggesting that someone had climbed it to get closer to the big cats.
18898	NYT_ENG_20071226.0223.LDC2009T13	Zoo Director Manuel Mollinedo said it was also likely that the animal was provoked.
18899	NYT_ENG_20071226.0223.LDC2009T13	"Somebody created a situation that really agitated her and gave her some sort of a method to break out," Mollinedo said.
18900	NYT_ENG_20071226.0223.LDC2009T13	"There is no possible way the cat could have made it out of there in a single leap.
18901	NYT_ENG_20071226.0223.LDC2009T13	I would surmise that there was help.
18902	NYT_ENG_20071226.0223.LDC2009T13	"A couple of feet dangling over the edge could possibly have done it," he added.
18903	NYT_ENG_20071226.0223.LDC2009T13	Sources said pinecones and sticks that were found in the moat might have been thrown at the animal.
18904	NYT_ENG_20071226.0223.LDC2009T13	Those items could not have landed in the grotto naturally, they said.
18905	NYT_ENG_20071226.0223.LDC2009T13	However, police Sgt. Neville Gittens maintained that there was no reason to think that the victims were taunting the tiger.
18906	NYT_ENG_20071226.0223.LDC2009T13	The two survivors were in serious but stable condition Wednesday following surgery at San Francisco General Hospital, doctors said.
18907	NYT_ENG_20071226.0223.LDC2009T13	The zoo, which closed Wednesday, will remain shut today so that police continue their investigation.
18908	NYT_ENG_20071226.0223.LDC2009T13	Mollinedo said he hopes the zoo will reopen Friday, but the tigers and lions will not be on display for at least a week.
18909	NYT_ENG_20071226.0223.LDC2009T13	The hunt for the escaped tiger Tuesday was confused and chaotic, with police and paramedics frantically scrambling through the 1,000-acre zoo grounds to locate victims after discovering Sousa's body.
18910	NYT_ENG_20071226.0223.LDC2009T13	There are no surveillance cameras pointed at the big cats' grottos, so officers could not find out from zoo security guards what animal or animals had escaped.
18911	NYT_ENG_20071226.0223.LDC2009T13	Initial calls for help didn't say what sort of animal had escaped, sources said.
18912	NYT_ENG_20071226.0223.LDC2009T13	The lack of cameras also has made it difficult to ascertain how the attacks occurred.
18913	NYT_ENG_20071226.0223.LDC2009T13	Police said the investigation will focus on physical evidence collected at the zoo, witness statements, an autopsy of the victim and the necropsy of the tiger.
18914	NYT_ENG_20071226.0223.LDC2009T13	New cameras and a metal barrier will be installed to protect the public from the tigers and lions, Mollinedo said.
18915	NYT_ENG_20071226.0223.LDC2009T13	As darkness deepened Tuesday, officers found that the modest level of zoo lighting was insufficient to illuminate the trees, foliage and public areas where they initially feared that more animals might be lurking or more victims might be found.
18916	NYT_ENG_20071226.0223.LDC2009T13	Firefighters standing on tall ladders outside the zoo illuminated the grounds with portable lights to help the search.
18917	NYT_ENG_20071226.0223.LDC2009T13	"We didn't know how many tigers were out," Mollinedo said.
18918	NYT_ENG_20071226.0223.LDC2009T13	"I (was) under the impression we had two or three cats escaping.
18919	NYT_ENG_20071226.0223.LDC2009T13	There was a sense of paranoia around here."
18920	NYT_ENG_20071226.0223.LDC2009T13	Investigators canvassed the zoo for hours Wednesday morning before finally determining that nobody else had been hurt.
18921	NYT_ENG_20071226.0223.LDC2009T13	A Fire Department source said three paramedics found Sousa's body, with a wide gash across the neck, lying near the grotto.
18922	NYT_ENG_20071226.0223.LDC2009T13	The enclosure is surrounded by a 25- to 30-foot-wide moat and a 14-foot-high wall.
18923	NYT_ENG_20071226.0223.LDC2009T13	The paramedics and an ambulance driver were told of additional victims outside the Terrace Cafe restaurant, about 300 yards east.
18924	NYT_ENG_20071226.0223.LDC2009T13	When they arrived, they found the tiger standing over one of the brothers.
18925	NYT_ENG_20071226.0223.LDC2009T13	The paramedics and driver were soon joined by the four police officers, who distracted the tiger with the red lights of their two patrol cars before shooting her to death with their .40-caliber handguns.
18926	NYT_ENG_20071226.0223.LDC2009T13	Gittens said the officers did not want to shoot the animal while she was sitting next to the victim.
18927	NYT_ENG_20071226.0223.LDC2009T13	"I can only imagine the patrons walking around, and suddenly seeing this tiger," he said.
18928	NYT_ENG_20071226.0223.LDC2009T13	"It was probably surreal."
18929	NYT_ENG_20071226.0223.LDC2009T13	Police were treating the zoo as a crime scene Wednesday.
18930	NYT_ENG_20071226.0223.LDC2009T13	Yellow police tape surrounded the area near the cafe where the animal was slain.
18931	NYT_ENG_20071226.0223.LDC2009T13	It's not known why the tiger singled out the three visitors or why she tracked down the two wounded victims, apparently ignoring other zoo patrons.
18932	NYT_ENG_20071226.0223.LDC2009T13	Rochelle Dicker, an emergency room surgeon at San Francisco General Hospital who operated on the victims, said Wednesday that the two survivors were recovering remarkably well.
18933	NYT_ENG_20071226.0223.LDC2009T13	They were awake and stable, Dicker said.
18934	NYT_ENG_20071226.0223.LDC2009T13	Doctors are focusing on preventing infection from the bacteria that may be present in the men's wounds, she said.
18935	NYT_ENG_20071226.0223.LDC2009T13	That bacteria is similar to the type found in the common house cat, officials said.
18936	NYT_ENG_20071226.0223.LDC2009T13	The zoo was eerily quiet on the day after the tragedy.
18937	NYT_ENG_20071226.0223.LDC2009T13	The cafe where the attack victims were found was shuttered and still, and a dozen police officers gathered with zoo officials nearby, poring over maps and handing out equipment.
18938	NYT_ENG_20071226.0223.LDC2009T13	Zookeepers held a staff meeting and also met with grief counselors.
18939	NYT_ENG_20071226.0223.LDC2009T13	Visitors continued to filter up to the entrance, unaware of what had happened.
18940	NYT_ENG_20071226.0223.LDC2009T13	"Oh my gosh!
18941	NYT_ENG_20071226.0223.LDC2009T13	I hadn't heard anything about a tiger," said one visitor, Komer Poodari of San Jose.
18942	NYT_ENG_20071226.0223.LDC2009T13	"I guess we'll go to Fisherman's Wharf."
18943	NYT_ENG_20071226.0223.LDC2009T13	Mollinedo said the zoo has a response team armed with tranquilizers and firearms, but that the scene unfolded "so quickly that the officers found (Tatiana) first."
18944	NYT_ENG_20071226.0223.LDC2009T13	This is the second time in just over a year that this same tiger attacked a human.
18945	NYT_ENG_20071226.0223.LDC2009T13	On Dec. 22, 2006, Tatiana chewed the flesh off zookeeper Lori Komejan's arm in front of about 50 visitors lingering in the Lion House after the cats were fed.
18946	NYT_ENG_20071226.0223.LDC2009T13	A state investigation later ruled that the zoo was at fault for the attack because of the way the cages were configured.
18947	NYT_ENG_20071226.0223.LDC2009T13	"There was never any consideration for putting her down.
18948	NYT_ENG_20071226.0223.LDC2009T13	The tiger was acting like a normal tiger," Mollinedo said.
18949	NYT_ENG_20071226.0223.LDC2009T13	The public feeding demonstrations at the Lion House resumed in September after about $250,000 in safety upgrades.
18950	NYT_ENG_20071226.0223.LDC2009T13	The city, which helps fund the zoo, is currently facing a lawsuit from Komejan and is assessing whether it is liable for the Christmas Day mauling, officials said.
18951	NYT_ENG_20071226.0223.LDC2009T13	Mollinedo has brought in colleagues from other accredited zoos to do a thorough analysis of the big cat exhibits.
18952	NYT_ENG_20071226.0223.LDC2009T13	"We want to make sure they are safe and see what kind of modifications should be done to ensure the safety" of people and animals, he said.
18953	NYT_ENG_20071226.0223.LDC2009T13	The U.S. Department of Agriculture will "in most likelihood" investigate the zoo's tiger facility, said agency spokesman Jim Brownlee.
18954	NYT_ENG_20071226.0223.LDC2009T13	Inspectors from the USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, which oversees the nation's zoos, will "probably be on location very soon," Brownlee said Wednesday night.
18955	NYT_ENG_20071226.0223.LDC2009T13	"We would look at the whole situation in a comprehensive manner," he said.
18956	NYT_ENG_20071226.0223.LDC2009T13	Keepers at other U.S. zoos said they were waiting for more details about the San Francisco attack before deciding whether to make changes in their tiger enclosures or security procedures.
18957	NYT_ENG_20071226.0223.LDC2009T13	Moats and sheer walls are common methods of protecting visitors from large animals at outdoor zoo exhibits.
18958	NYT_ENG_20071226.0223.LDC2009T13	"We still don't know what happened," said Tony Vecchio, director of the Oregon Zoo in Portland.
18959	NYT_ENG_20071226.0223.LDC2009T13	"We know what animals can do and we build barriers that are taller and wider than that.
18960	NYT_ENG_20071226.0223.LDC2009T13	But one of the rules in the zoo business is that animals will always surprise you."

18964	NYT_ENG_20080102.0150.LDC2009T13	Reality TV shows aren't the only thing to look forward to this winter.
18965	NYT_ENG_20080102.0150.LDC2009T13	Game shows are the other choice.
18966	NYT_ENG_20080102.0150.LDC2009T13	One such offering is Fox's new game show "The Moment of Truth," which debuts 9 p.m. Jan. 23.
18967	NYT_ENG_20080102.0150.LDC2009T13	Participants will be put to the test -- the lie detector test -- to reveal whether or not they are being honest for a chance to win $500,000.
18968	NYT_ENG_20080102.0150.LDC2009T13	First, contestants must answer 21 increasingly personal questions honestly, as determined by a polygraph, to which they are attached prior to the game.
18969	NYT_ENG_20080102.0150.LDC2009T13	At any time, between the polygraph and the televised game, participants can change their answers or walk away from the competition and forfeit the big cash payout.
18970	NYT_ENG_20080102.0150.LDC2009T13	To win, the contestant must fess up to every one of her personal revelations knowing that the truth could spark shock and disappointment in her relatives and friends and cause public embarrassment on national television.
18971	NYT_ENG_20080102.0150.LDC2009T13	If the Pinocchio motif of "The Moment of Truth" doesn't pique your interest, the current nine-week Writers Guild of America strike ensures the production of two returning game shows that don't use writers to fill in the broadcast network's programming holes:
18972	NYT_ENG_20080102.0150.LDC2009T13	"Power of 10" (8 p.m. Wednesdays on CBS, Channel 62): Drew Carey pulls double duty -- he also hosts "The Price Is Right" in the day -- and fronts this summer-time favorite where contestants guess at the mindset of American pollsters, "Family Feud" style, for a shot at the $10 million top prize.
18973	NYT_ENG_20080102.0150.LDC2009T13	"1 vs. 100" (8 p.m. Fridays on NBC, Channel 4): Contestants face off with a mob of 100 to correctly answer a number of trivia questions.
18974	NYT_ENG_20080102.0150.LDC2009T13	Comedian Bob Saget hosts.

18977	NYT_ENG_20080112.0080.LDC2009T13	Commentary: New Hampshire melted my cold Floridian heart
18978	NYT_ENG_20080112.0080.LDC2009T13	It is wicked cold here in Dover, N.H., and the residents are pale and lumpy in their New England Patriots jackets, and the roadsides are festooned with campaign signs planted in the sooty snow banks like flags in Mount Everest, and in so many ways it is so much different than the rest of America.
18979	NYT_ENG_20080112.0080.LDC2009T13	If New Hampshire were applying for the job of vetting candidates for president of these United States, one might suggest that New Hampshire look elsewhere for work, like at one of the approximately 1,443,713 Dunkin' Donuts that cover the state, the way corn covers Iowa.
18980	NYT_ENG_20080112.0080.LDC2009T13	As a political reporter for Florida's largest newspaper, my sense has long been that New Hampshire played an outsized role in choosing the nation's presidential candidates.
18981	NYT_ENG_20080112.0080.LDC2009T13	It has only 1.3-million residents, far fewer than live in the Tampa Bay area.
18982	NYT_ENG_20080112.0080.LDC2009T13	More than 95 percent of them are white.
18983	NYT_ENG_20080112.0080.LDC2009T13	You can drive from one end of New Hampshire to the other and back in less time than it takes to get from St. Petersburg to Miami, and that's taking the long way.
18984	NYT_ENG_20080112.0080.LDC2009T13	It is dangerously close to Canada, a foreign country full of foreigners who, if they were to sneak across the border, would be illegal immigrants.
18985	NYT_ENG_20080112.0080.LDC2009T13	So what makes the Granite State so great, so prescient, that it should tell everyone else in the country who should be president?
18986	NYT_ENG_20080112.0080.LDC2009T13	Wondering that very same thing, the Florida Legislature last year moved the Sunshine State's Democratic and Republican primary elections to Jan. 29, figuring a large, diverse and politically important state deserved a bigger role in choosing the next presidential candidates.
18987	NYT_ENG_20080112.0080.LDC2009T13	New Hampshire and the other early primary and caucus states Iowa, Nevada and South Carolina were not amused.
18988	NYT_ENG_20080112.0080.LDC2009T13	Vetting presidents was their job, their political leaders insisted.
18989	NYT_ENG_20080112.0080.LDC2009T13	Florida was too big to serve as a laboratory, and it cost too much to campaign there.
18990	NYT_ENG_20080112.0080.LDC2009T13	Besides, the argument went, folks in other states just didn't have the tradition and interest in choosing the best candidates.
18991	NYT_ENG_20080112.0080.LDC2009T13	"It's part of the culture here," said Fergus Cullen, the chairman of the New Hampshire Republican Party.
18992	NYT_ENG_20080112.0080.LDC2009T13	"This is sort of hard for outsiders to appreciate, and I recognize that.
18993	NYT_ENG_20080112.0080.LDC2009T13	But because the process has evolved over the last half century, voters take their role very seriously.
18994	NYT_ENG_20080112.0080.LDC2009T13	We go to forums, go to town meetings, and make very informed decisions."
18995	NYT_ENG_20080112.0080.LDC2009T13	That's the myth, anyway.
18996	NYT_ENG_20080112.0080.LDC2009T13	But is it true?
18997	NYT_ENG_20080112.0080.LDC2009T13	Hit the ground shivering
18998	NYT_ENG_20080112.0080.LDC2009T13	I arrived in Concord, N.H., around 3 p.m. about a week before the election.
18999	NYT_ENG_20080112.0080.LDC2009T13	The digital thermometer outside the Merrimack County Bank read 10 degrees, but Ron Paul supporters were marching back and forth in the snow along Main Street, dressed like colonists from the Revolutionary War period.
19000	NYT_ENG_20080112.0080.LDC2009T13	Behind the fogged-up glass walls of Barack Obama's office downtown, rows of campaign workers called potential supporters to ask for their votes.
19001	NYT_ENG_20080112.0080.LDC2009T13	Young volunteers from Florida, Virginia and New York were pouring in, ready to go door-to-door to get out the votes for their candidates.
19002	NYT_ENG_20080112.0080.LDC2009T13	Nina Hopkins of Henniker, N.H., emerged from the John Edwards office in downtown Concord with an armful of brochures and loaded them into her minivan.
19003	NYT_ENG_20080112.0080.LDC2009T13	She and her kids, Brenna, 8, and Micaela, 9, planned to deposit them with neighbors as they walked their dog.
19004	NYT_ENG_20080112.0080.LDC2009T13	In 2000, Hopkins had supported Arizona Sen. John McCain, a Republican, but she was won over by Edwards, a former Democratic senator from North Carolina, and his populist message of change.
19005	NYT_ENG_20080112.0080.LDC2009T13	That's not the kind of switch you'll see in a lot of states.
19006	NYT_ENG_20080112.0080.LDC2009T13	"We think for ourselves out here.
19007	NYT_ENG_20080112.0080.LDC2009T13	That's why we like the candidates coming here," she said.
19008	NYT_ENG_20080112.0080.LDC2009T13	"We want to hear them speak, and ask them questions.
19009	NYT_ENG_20080112.0080.LDC2009T13	We take it very seriously."
19010	NYT_ENG_20080112.0080.LDC2009T13	And then there were the passers-by.
19011	NYT_ENG_20080112.0080.LDC2009T13	After 17 years of covering government at every level, from sewer commissions to the races for the U.S. Senate, House and presidency, never have I found so many people so well-informed.
19012	NYT_ENG_20080112.0080.LDC2009T13	Almost without exception, everyone I stopped on the street was eager to talk about the upcoming presidential primaries and, what's more, had a cogent opinion about whom they liked, and why.
19013	NYT_ENG_20080112.0080.LDC2009T13	Maybe these people weren't packing political events just to get in out of the cold.
19014	NYT_ENG_20080112.0080.LDC2009T13	There is, indeed, a tradition of direct democracy unlike that in almost any other state.
19015	NYT_ENG_20080112.0080.LDC2009T13	New Hampshire's state House of Representatives boasts more members than any other state there are 400 of them, in fact, one for about every 3,000 residents.
19016	NYT_ENG_20080112.0080.LDC2009T13	Almost every supervisory position in local and county government is elected, and every official even the governor must stand for re-election every two years.
19017	NYT_ENG_20080112.0080.LDC2009T13	Voter turnout typically surpasses 70 percent, nearly 20 percent higher than the national average.
19018	NYT_ENG_20080112.0080.LDC2009T13	But my first real ah-hah moment came a week ago Saturday.
19019	NYT_ENG_20080112.0080.LDC2009T13	People had started lining up around 8 a.m. for an 11 a.m. rally with Sen. Barack Obama at a high school in Nashua.
19020	NYT_ENG_20080112.0080.LDC2009T13	The line soon stretched about half a mile.
19021	NYT_ENG_20080112.0080.LDC2009T13	Kids drew Obama's name on the blacktop with chunks of ice.
19022	NYT_ENG_20080112.0080.LDC2009T13	By 10 a.m., more than 2,000 people were waiting cheerfully, including Craig and Melinda Willever, who had driven more than an hour from Portsmouth.
19023	NYT_ENG_20080112.0080.LDC2009T13	It was 23 degrees.
19024	NYT_ENG_20080112.0080.LDC2009T13	"We really have an impact on how people vote in this country," explained Mr. Willever, 51, a postal worker.
19025	NYT_ENG_20080112.0080.LDC2009T13	Added his wife, an antiques dealer, "It's a privilege."
19026	NYT_ENG_20080112.0080.LDC2009T13	The second defining moment came around noon on Monday, the day before the election.
19027	NYT_ENG_20080112.0080.LDC2009T13	I was covering Sen. Hillary Clinton, a Democrat from New York who would narrowly win the primary, at a town hall meeting in Dover, up near Portsmouth, when I met Wendy Beagen, 47, of Madbury, N.H..
19028	NYT_ENG_20080112.0080.LDC2009T13	She was going to see Obama that night, too.
19029	NYT_ENG_20080112.0080.LDC2009T13	"I wasn't even going to come here today because I've already heard her speak," Beagan said.
19030	NYT_ENG_20080112.0080.LDC2009T13	"But why not?
19031	NYT_ENG_20080112.0080.LDC2009T13	No one else gets this chance."
19032	NYT_ENG_20080112.0080.LDC2009T13	She called it an honor.
19033	NYT_ENG_20080112.0080.LDC2009T13	Thinking with ego
19034	NYT_ENG_20080112.0080.LDC2009T13	You'll be hard pressed to convince me that the Democratic leaders of the four approved early voting states Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina were thinking with their heads when they pushed the leading Democratic candidates to boycott Florida after the state moved its primary to Jan. 29, a week earlier than allowed.
19035	NYT_ENG_20080112.0080.LDC2009T13	They were thinking with their egos.
19036	NYT_ENG_20080112.0080.LDC2009T13	But despite my earlier skepticism, I now believe the argument that Florida could mess up what seems like a valuable process, particularly in New Hampshire.
19037	NYT_ENG_20080112.0080.LDC2009T13	Yes, Florida looks more like America.
19038	NYT_ENG_20080112.0080.LDC2009T13	Yes, winning Florida has become key to winning the presidency.
19039	NYT_ENG_20080112.0080.LDC2009T13	But New Hampshire doesn't really choose the next president, or even the next presidential nominees.
19040	NYT_ENG_20080112.0080.LDC2009T13	Its voters last week didn't anoint Clinton and McCain, who won the Republican contest
19041	NYT_ENG_20080112.0080.LDC2009T13	they just let them keep going.
19042	NYT_ENG_20080112.0080.LDC2009T13	The last two presidents George W. Bush and Bill Clinton, who together served 16 years both lost New Hampshire.
19043	NYT_ENG_20080112.0080.LDC2009T13	McCain beat Bush there in 2000, and you probably don't remember who beat Clinton in 1992 (the late Sen. Paul Tsongas).
19044	NYT_ENG_20080112.0080.LDC2009T13	Instead, the Granite Staters cull those candidates whose organizations, ideas or personas just aren't quite ready for prime time.
19045	NYT_ENG_20080112.0080.LDC2009T13	Their questions and scrutiny prepare the survivors to meet the rest of us.
19046	NYT_ENG_20080112.0080.LDC2009T13	And from what I can tell, they do a wicked good job.

19049	NYT_ENG_20080117.0097.LDC2009T13	REDUCING WATER PRESSURE, LADY BUGS
19050	NYT_ENG_20080117.0097.LDC2009T13	Q. I have very high water pressure that measures about 100 (pounds per square inch I think), compared to a normal of 60.
19051	NYT_ENG_20080117.0097.LDC2009T13	Could I turn the main valve down by half to reduce this pressure?
19052	NYT_ENG_20080117.0097.LDC2009T13	TOO MUCH OOMPH
19053	NYT_ENG_20080117.0097.LDC2009T13	A. I doubt it.
19054	NYT_ENG_20080117.0097.LDC2009T13	There are two aspects to water delivery: Pressure (how much weight is behind the water flow) and volume (how much water is being pushed).
19055	NYT_ENG_20080117.0097.LDC2009T13	Closing the intake valve down by a half or so will reduce the volume but the pressure will stay the same.
19056	NYT_ENG_20080117.0097.LDC2009T13	But you can do something: Have a plumber install a pressure reducing valve on the main line coming into the house.
19057	NYT_ENG_20080117.0097.LDC2009T13	This is a good idea because the high pressure can damage the pipes, especially the connections.
19058	NYT_ENG_20080117.0097.LDC2009T13	Q. Two questions: I am getting quite a few lady bugs in the fall and even in the winter.
19059	NYT_ENG_20080117.0097.LDC2009T13	They often hide in the ruffles of the curtains.
19060	NYT_ENG_20080117.0097.LDC2009T13	How can I keep them out of the house?
19061	NYT_ENG_20080117.0097.LDC2009T13	Second part: I have asbestos-cement shingles on my house
19062	NYT_ENG_20080117.0097.LDC2009T13	a man who came to paint the siding first power-washed the shingles.
19063	NYT_ENG_20080117.0097.LDC2009T13	Is that acceptable?
19064	NYT_ENG_20080117.0097.LDC2009T13	CONFUSED
19065	NYT_ENG_20080117.0097.LDC2009T13	A.
19066	NYT_ENG_20080117.0097.LDC2009T13	The lady bugs are, like most insects in fall and winter, seeking warmth.
19067	NYT_ENG_20080117.0097.LDC2009T13	Keep sweeping them up and tossing them outside
19068	NYT_ENG_20080117.0097.LDC2009T13	they will have to take their chances outdoors in winter.
19069	NYT_ENG_20080117.0097.LDC2009T13	Insecticides are too drastic a control and should not be used indoors.
19070	NYT_ENG_20080117.0097.LDC2009T13	The bugs may be the Asian Spotted Lady Beetle, which hitched a ride 20 or so years ago, on a ship sailing from Japan to a southern US port.
19071	NYT_ENG_20080117.0097.LDC2009T13	From there they proliferated and spread into many parts of the country.
19072	NYT_ENG_20080117.0097.LDC2009T13	They are harmless, but their sheer numbers can be a nuisance.
19073	NYT_ENG_20080117.0097.LDC2009T13	Second part: Asbestos-cement should not be power-washed, sanded, cut, trimmed, sawed, or drilled.
19074	NYT_ENG_20080117.0097.LDC2009T13	That is a problem when paint is peeling from the shingles, and there is no practical answer.
19075	NYT_ENG_20080117.0097.LDC2009T13	What might work is carefully hosing off loose paint if that is possible, and wiping with a wet cloth, then painting with the hope that the paint will sort of bind any remaining loose paint together.
19076	NYT_ENG_20080117.0097.LDC2009T13	Q. My Sears wall oven has developed a loose glass pane in the double-glazed window of the oven, where the pane fell into the window cavity.
19077	NYT_ENG_20080117.0097.LDC2009T13	Can I use the oven?
19078	NYT_ENG_20080117.0097.LDC2009T13	I talked to people at Sears who said they don't make them any more, and were no help.
19079	NYT_ENG_20080117.0097.LDC2009T13	I also cannot get the door off.
19080	NYT_ENG_20080117.0097.LDC2009T13	If I could, I'd take it to a craftsman so he can fix it.
19081	NYT_ENG_20080117.0097.LDC2009T13	What can I do?
19082	NYT_ENG_20080117.0097.LDC2009T13	KAREN, Canton
19083	NYT_ENG_20080117.0097.LDC2009T13	A.
19084	NYT_ENG_20080117.0097.LDC2009T13	So much for Sears.
19085	NYT_ENG_20080117.0097.LDC2009T13	Your best bet is to contact a local appliance dealer.
19086	NYT_ENG_20080117.0097.LDC2009T13	It has been my experience that the local guys deal exclusively with appliances, and are not only very knowledgeable but they also aim to please.
19087	NYT_ENG_20080117.0097.LDC2009T13	They want your business, and want to keep it.
19088	NYT_ENG_20080117.0097.LDC2009T13	Meanwhile, I don't think using the oven will hurt, except to lose more heat to the kitchen than usual.
19089	NYT_ENG_20080117.0097.LDC2009T13	Q. I plan to install fiber-cement siding over asbestos-cement shingles.
19090	NYT_ENG_20080117.0097.LDC2009T13	Can that be done?
19091	NYT_ENG_20080117.0097.LDC2009T13	Where can I find a contractor who will do this?
19092	NYT_ENG_20080117.0097.LDC2009T13	GEORGE HARRINGTON,Framingham
19093	NYT_ENG_20080117.0097.LDC2009T13	A. Let's put it this way: Vinyl siding installers nail their siding over asbestos-cement, first applying a bed of styrofoam insulation to even out the surface and to prevent the asbestos, when nailed, from falling apart when it is broken up by nailing.
19094	NYT_ENG_20080117.0097.LDC2009T13	I think it is a terrible practice which eventually could result in those shards of broken asbestos being released to the air.
19095	NYT_ENG_20080117.0097.LDC2009T13	To be safe, call your local building department to determine if this practice can be done.
19096	NYT_ENG_20080117.0097.LDC2009T13	To find a contractor, call a manufacturer of fiber-cement clapboards.
19097	NYT_ENG_20080117.0097.LDC2009T13	James Hardie is one of these.
19098	NYT_ENG_20080117.0097.LDC2009T13	Q. I have a moisture problem in my attic.
19099	NYT_ENG_20080117.0097.LDC2009T13	The probable culprit is a loose-fitting, uninsulated attic hatch, which I intend to fix.
19100	NYT_ENG_20080117.0097.LDC2009T13	I do have soffit and ridge vents, but I noticed the ridge vents are completely covered by a foot of snow.
19101	NYT_ENG_20080117.0097.LDC2009T13	Is the solution another type of vent such as a gable or power vent?
19102	NYT_ENG_20080117.0097.LDC2009T13	Do many houses have venting in addition to ridge and soffits?
19103	NYT_ENG_20080117.0097.LDC2009T13	JAKE, Pepperell
19104	NYT_ENG_20080117.0097.LDC2009T13	A.
19105	NYT_ENG_20080117.0097.LDC2009T13	Since most of the moisture problem is coming from the attic hatch, the snow-covered ridge vent will make little difference
19106	NYT_ENG_20080117.0097.LDC2009T13	I do not think snow is much of an air stop, so some air is escaping.
19107	NYT_ENG_20080117.0097.LDC2009T13	But if you insist, to handle the problem of snow blocking the ridge vent, install large gable vents, which will help prevent too much moisture in the attic until the snow melts.
19108	NYT_ENG_20080117.0097.LDC2009T13	Those gable vents may make the ridge-soffit system less efficient, but I don't think it is a big deal.
19109	NYT_ENG_20080117.0097.LDC2009T13	Blocking and insulating the attic hatch may solve the problem even without the gable vent.

19117	NYT_ENG_20080123.0277.LDC2009T13	MISSISSIPPI TO USE SOME HURRICANE AID FOR HOUSING PROGRAM
19118	NYT_ENG_20080123.0277.LDC2009T13	As Mississippi awaits a decision on whether it can spend $600 million of federal hurricane relief on a controversial plan to rebuild and expand a shipping port, the state has added $100 million of federal aid to a program to develop housing for low- and moderate-income workers.
19119	NYT_ENG_20080123.0277.LDC2009T13	The addition, which brings the housing program to $250 million, will produce more than 2,500 housing units, said Gov. Haley Barbour, who announced the increase on Tuesday.
19120	NYT_ENG_20080123.0277.LDC2009T13	Though it has been widely praised for the speed of its hurricane recovery effort, Mississippi has been criticized by religious and civic groups for slighting the needs of the poor.
19121	NYT_ENG_20080123.0277.LDC2009T13	Congress gave the state $5.5 billion in hurricane recovery grants, with the proviso that half of it should be used to help low-income families, but critics say that less than a quarter of the money is being used that way.
19122	NYT_ENG_20080123.0277.LDC2009T13	The new allocation may not dampen that criticism because the money is being transferred from another program that was supposed to help the poor by giving grants to low-income homeowners whose houses flooded in Hurricane Katrina's storm surge.
19123	NYT_ENG_20080123.0277.LDC2009T13	That program received fewer applications than expected, the governor's spokesman, Pete Smith, wrote in an e-mail message.
19124	NYT_ENG_20080123.0277.LDC2009T13	The state has distributed about $217 million in grants to more than 3,000 applicants to that program, according to data from the Mississippi Development Authority.
19125	NYT_ENG_20080123.0277.LDC2009T13	A larger program, which primarily serves wealthier homeowners, has distributed more than $1 billion to more than 15,000 homeowners.
19126	NYT_ENG_20080123.0277.LDC2009T13	Advocates for the poor said that they were concerned that not everyone who qualified for a rebuilding grant had received one, and that in any event the state was still not committing enough money to programs to replace low-income housing, to help renters or to assist people whose houses were damaged by wind rather than flooding.
19127	NYT_ENG_20080123.0277.LDC2009T13	"Washington is really examining how successful Mississippi's recovery is for all of its citizens," said Kimberly Miller, state policy specialist for Oxfam America in Biloxi.
19128	NYT_ENG_20080123.0277.LDC2009T13	Her group has urged the Department of Housing and Urban Development to reject the state's bid to use hurricane recovery money to expand the port, in Gulfport, which was damaged by the hurricane.
19129	NYT_ENG_20080123.0277.LDC2009T13	The state has asked the agency to waive a rule that limits economic development spending to about $50,000 per job created.
19130	NYT_ENG_20080129.0257.LDC2009T13	SPORTS COLUMN: COUGHLIN WRITES HIS OWN MATERIAL
19131	NYT_ENG_20080129.0257.LDC2009T13	GLENDALE, Ariz.
19132	NYT_ENG_20080129.0257.LDC2009T13	One hour with reporters, or the amount of action minutes it takes to complete an entire football game, would seem to be the worst of tortures for Bill Belichick and Tom Coughlin, even on Super Bowl media day, the annual orgy of talking and league-mandated tolerance.
19133	NYT_ENG_20080129.0257.LDC2009T13	As Coughlin said after mounting a small stage here Tuesday, waiting for the clock to run on his imagined punishment for leading his upstart Giants here to challenge Belichick's still- perfect Patriots, "I don't want to get this going one second faster than I have to."
19134	NYT_ENG_20080129.0257.LDC2009T13	When he finally sat down, he compared himself to the guy on the carnival hot seat, waiting to be dunked in the water.
19135	NYT_ENG_20080129.0257.LDC2009T13	But he got a laugh on that one, and before we knew it, the erstwhile contrarian and longtime curmudgeon was an engaging, wise- cracking, media-day star, and not solely measured against the low-bar standard set by Belichick earlier in the day.
19136	NYT_ENG_20080129.0257.LDC2009T13	How do you not gain new-found respect for a professional football coach who takes a moment on the national stage to make fun of his own anatomical imperfection?
19137	NYT_ENG_20080129.0257.LDC2009T13	"Anybody with ears like these ought to cover them up," Coughlin said, having learned the hard way by briefly exposing them to the frigid Green Bay conditions two Sundays ago.
19138	NYT_ENG_20080129.0257.LDC2009T13	Reporters came and went and were immediately replaced by more quotation-hungry masses with little in the way of anything new to ask.
19139	NYT_ENG_20080129.0257.LDC2009T13	To Coughlin's right, the digital clock on the scoreboard at the University of Phoenix Stadium, visible to him with a mere peripheral glance, began to slowly wind down.
19140	NYT_ENG_20080129.0257.LDC2009T13	Tick tick tick.
19141	NYT_ENG_20080129.0257.LDC2009T13	Who would be the poor, unsuspecting soul to make Coughlin bristle, if not frustrated and red-faced?
19142	NYT_ENG_20080129.0257.LDC2009T13	"I should have had statements printed up, handed them out," Coughlin said when asked, a third time, about the accrued benefits of standing up to the challenge of the Patriots in the final game of the regular season.He answered the question, though, and the longer he continued, the more he didn't seem to mind the repetition, no more than he would making his receivers re-run practice routes.
19143	NYT_ENG_20080129.0257.LDC2009T13	Here at the first Super Bowl of his head- coaching career, with a handsome contract extension to come, Coughlin was a man on a mission to make a few friends.
19144	NYT_ENG_20080129.0257.LDC2009T13	Other responses were caustic, but almost endearingly so.
19145	NYT_ENG_20080129.0257.LDC2009T13	When someone began a question by calling him conservative, Coughlin said: "Me?
19146	NYT_ENG_20080129.0257.LDC2009T13	How can you say that?
19147	NYT_ENG_20080129.0257.LDC2009T13	You're taking a wild stab there."
19148	NYT_ENG_20080129.0257.LDC2009T13	But he also became emotional when he spoke of his Jay Fund Foundation, which he created in the name of Jay McGillis, a former player of Coughlin's at Boston College who died of leukemia.
19149	NYT_ENG_20080129.0257.LDC2009T13	He bought into media day silliness, playfully responding when 10-year-old Jason Krause of Chicago, armed with an ESPN credential and mic, stepped up to congratulate him on "being nicer" this season.
19150	NYT_ENG_20080129.0257.LDC2009T13	"Tom Coughlin is relaxed, he's upbeat, he's fun.
19151	NYT_ENG_20080129.0257.LDC2009T13	I haven't seen him like this in a long time," Steve Mariucci, the former 49ers and Lions coach, told his NFL Network audience to the side of the stage.
19152	NYT_ENG_20080129.0257.LDC2009T13	Mariucci soon lured Coughlin into an animated discussion of the West Coast offense Mariucci once gave him a few pointers on.
19153	NYT_ENG_20080129.0257.LDC2009T13	A question about the leadership council of players Coughlin created this season initiated a heartfelt monologue about his improved communication this season, his determination that "the players were not going to be uncomfortable because of me."
19154	NYT_ENG_20080129.0257.LDC2009T13	He talked about the more organic aspects of coaching years ago at the Rochester Institute of Technology, about having a roster of 30 and being out lining the fields when his coaching counterpart from the University of Albany pulled up for a game "with busloads of players."
19155	NYT_ENG_20080129.0257.LDC2009T13	After arriving in Phoenix Monday night and declaring that he was "not going to be reflective
19156	NYT_ENG_20080129.0257.LDC2009T13	that is not where I'm going," Coughlin went with the flow, embracing the most essential media day tenet.
19157	NYT_ENG_20080129.0257.LDC2009T13	He was an elaborator, a storyteller, a veritable entertainer.
19158	NYT_ENG_20080129.0257.LDC2009T13	For his part, Belichick had a sound bite to remember, when approached by a female reporter from Mexico's TV Azteca dressed in a short wedding dress with white thigh-high stockings.
19159	NYT_ENG_20080129.0257.LDC2009T13	She had just offered herself in wedlock to Tom Brady.
19160	NYT_ENG_20080129.0257.LDC2009T13	"You think I am better than Gisele?"
19161	NYT_ENG_20080129.0257.LDC2009T13	the reporter, standing on a bench to provide Belichick an enhanced view, asked, referring to Brady's supermodel girlfriend, Gisele Bundchen.
19162	NYT_ENG_20080129.0257.LDC2009T13	"I wouldn't go that far," Belichick said in his seldom-modulated monotone.
19163	NYT_ENG_20080129.0257.LDC2009T13	Nor would he go very far in trying to rise to the occasion of media day.
19164	NYT_ENG_20080129.0257.LDC2009T13	Granted, this is old hat now for Belichick, but before spending an enjoyable hour with Coughlin, breaks were necessary from Belichick's clipped, detached rhetoric.
19165	NYT_ENG_20080129.0257.LDC2009T13	He might be the more decorated coach, the deeper thinker, but he is also a permanently closed book to those outside his inner circle.
19166	NYT_ENG_20080129.0257.LDC2009T13	More passionate, more easily provoked and therefore more human, Coughlin won the personality contest between these reputably recalcitrant Super Bowl coaches, hands down.
19167	NYT_ENG_20080129.0257.LDC2009T13	"You look like you enjoyed this," Coughlin was told after he had kept talking, even after the clock had run out.
19168	NYT_ENG_20080129.0257.LDC2009T13	"I did," he said, unsmiling, almost scowling.
19169	NYT_ENG_20080129.0257.LDC2009T13	But unquestionably sincere.
19170	NYT_ENG_20080205.0134.LDC2009T13	UKRAINE, EAGER FOR TIES TO THE WEST, JOINS THE WTO
19171	NYT_ENG_20080205.0134.LDC2009T13	MOSCOW
19172	NYT_ENG_20080205.0134.LDC2009T13	Ukraine joined the World Trade Organization on Tuesday after 14 years of negotiations, a milestone for the former Soviet republic that helps clear the way for a valuable free trade agreement with the European Union.
19173	NYT_ENG_20080205.0134.LDC2009T13	Officials in the Ukrainian capital, Kiev, suggested that the membership represented a coming of age, of sorts, for trade relations of former Soviet countries.
19174	NYT_ENG_20080205.0134.LDC2009T13	The deal is expected to lift living standards and increase investment in what is one of Europe's poorest countries.
19175	NYT_ENG_20080205.0134.LDC2009T13	Ukraine -- with a population around 46 million and a gross domestic product estimated by the World Bank at $106 billion -- became the largest former Soviet state to join the trade group to date
19176	NYT_ENG_20080205.0134.LDC2009T13	Russia is negotiating for membership.
19177	NYT_ENG_20080205.0134.LDC2009T13	"We have difficult homework to do," President Viktor A. Yushchenko of Ukraine said at a news conference in Geneva, where the WTO is based, as quoted by Bloomberg News.
19178	NYT_ENG_20080205.0134.LDC2009T13	"This starts the colossal integration work that lies ahead."
19179	NYT_ENG_20080205.0134.LDC2009T13	He said membership meant "better living standards, higher wages, improved social standards and economic life."
19180	NYT_ENG_20080205.0134.LDC2009T13	Trade among the former Soviet republics has often seemed chaotic, marred by politics, fraud and strange barter deals, like a swap in the mid-1990s when Ukraine paid for natural gas with a vast quantity of rubber boots instead of cash.
19181	NYT_ENG_20080205.0134.LDC2009T13	The final hurdle for Ukraine to join the WTO was an agreement to lower existing export tariffs on cattle, animal skins and ferrous metals, and not to raise them in the foreseeable future.
19182	NYT_ENG_20080205.0134.LDC2009T13	The deal -- about three years after Yushchenko came to power in widespread protests that became known as the Orange Revolution, pledging to integrate Ukraine more closely with the West -- paves the way for talks on creating a trade zone with the European Union.
19183	NYT_ENG_20080205.0134.LDC2009T13	While the European bloc has declined to open membership talks, it kept the door open for discussions on a trade pact if Ukraine became a member of the WTO first.
19184	NYT_ENG_20080205.0134.LDC2009T13	The membership can be expected to give Ukraine some leverage in settling disputes with Russia over steel, sugar and dairy products.
19185	NYT_ENG_20080205.0134.LDC2009T13	Though Russia is working to join the WTO, because Ukraine is now in, it will have a veto on Russian membership.
19186	NYT_ENG_20080205.0134.LDC2009T13	Another Russian neighbor, Georgia, has threatened to use its veto against Russian membership unless Moscow lifts a ban on imports of Georgian wine, ostensibly for health reasons though more likely a result of the souring of political relations between the countries.
19187	NYT_ENG_20080205.0134.LDC2009T13	Russia also bans the import of Georgian mineral water and citrus fruit.
19188	NYT_ENG_20080205.0134.LDC2009T13	Ukraine will take a different tack, Irina Gerashchenko, a member of parliament from Yushchenko's Our Ukraine party, explained in a telephone interview.
19189	NYT_ENG_20080205.0134.LDC2009T13	Yushchenko's support of Russia's membership, she said, was aimed at ushering Russia into the group as quickly as possible so that Ukraine can avail itself of the WTO's dispute-resolution mechanisms to resolve their conflicts.
19190	NYT_ENG_20080205.0134.LDC2009T13	At the signing ceremony on Tuesday, Yushchenko said that he would support Russia's membership.
19191	NYT_ENG_20080205.0134.LDC2009T13	For Ukraine, he said, membership in the WTO would raise the gross domestic product and bring additional billions in foreign investment.
19192	NYT_ENG_20080205.0134.LDC2009T13	The agreement is subject to ratification by the Ukrainian parliament, or Rada, by July 4.
19193	NYT_ENG_20080205.0134.LDC2009T13	All major Ukrainian political parties except the Communists support membership, but that may not guarantee easy approval.
19194	NYT_ENG_20080205.0134.LDC2009T13	Earlier in the day, Yushchenko canceled a speech equivalent to the State of the Union because opposition members of parliament occupied the rostrum
19195	NYT_ENG_20080205.0134.LDC2009T13	others hung posters on the walls protesting the president's support for joining NATO.
19196	NYT_ENG_20080205.0134.LDC2009T13	The speaker of parliament removed the presidential speech from the day's agenda, and the president's press service said it would be rescheduled.
19197	NYT_ENG_20080205.0134.LDC2009T13	Yushchenko then flew to Geneva to sign the trade pact.

19199	NYT_ENG_20080206.0095.LDC2009T13	Brian McNamee's lawyers are promising to deliver a bombshell on Thursday against Roger Clemens.
19200	NYT_ENG_20080206.0095.LDC2009T13	McNamee, Clemens's former trainer, will produce "corroborative physical evidence" for congressional investigators that he injected Clemens with performance-enhancing drugs, the trainer's lawyers said Wednesday.
19201	NYT_ENG_20080206.0095.LDC2009T13	According to a lawyer familiar with the matter, McNamee had syringes used to inject Clemens with steroids and human growth hormone that still had traces of Clemens' blood.
19202	NYT_ENG_20080206.0095.LDC2009T13	McNamee gave those syringes to federal prosecutors last month when they came to New York to meet with McNamee and his lawyer, Earl Ward.
19203	NYT_ENG_20080206.0095.LDC2009T13	McNamee has asserted that he injected Clemens with steroids and human growth hormone from 1998 to 2001.
19204	NYT_ENG_20080206.0095.LDC2009T13	The lawyer said McNamee would sometimes inject Clemens at the pitcher's apartment in New York and would then take the syringes with him because he had a hazardous waste disposal at his own home in Queens.
19205	NYT_ENG_20080206.0095.LDC2009T13	The lawyer said McNamee still had some of those syringes even after the Mitchell report was released last December and that he gave them to Internal Revenue Service special agent Jeff Novitzky.
19206	NYT_ENG_20080206.0095.LDC2009T13	The lawyer said McNamee also had gauze pads used to remove blood from Clemens' skin after injections in 2000 and 2001.
19207	NYT_ENG_20080206.0095.LDC2009T13	Those gauze pads have also been turned over to federal investigators.
19208	NYT_ENG_20080206.0095.LDC2009T13	McNamee is scheduled to give a deposition to the House Oversight committee on Thursday and his lawyers said his evidence would be released publicly after his session with congressional staff members.
19209	NYT_ENG_20080206.0095.LDC2009T13	Clemens gave a sworn deposition on Tuesday denying he had ever used steroids or human-growth hormone.
19210	NYT_ENG_20080206.0095.LDC2009T13	"This will totally corroborate that Brian has been telling the truth from the beginning," Ward, McNamee's lead lawyer, said in a telephone interview.
19211	NYT_ENG_20080206.0095.LDC2009T13	"It takes it out of the category of he-said, he-said."
19212	NYT_ENG_20080206.0095.LDC2009T13	Another lawyer, Richard Emery, added, "Knoblauch and Pettitte and all the other people who corroborate Brian are going to be much less important than this physical evidence we provide."
19213	NYT_ENG_20080206.0095.LDC2009T13	Chuck Knoblauch and Andy Pettitte are former teammates of Clemens' and former clients of McNamee's who have not denied McNamee's allegations that he injected them with human-growth hormone.
19214	NYT_ENG_20080206.0095.LDC2009T13	McNamee has told federal investigators and former Sen. George J. Mitchell, who produced a report on performance-enhancing drugs in baseball, that he injected Clemens at least 16 times with steroids and human-growth hormone.
19215	NYT_ENG_20080206.0095.LDC2009T13	Clemens flatly denied that assertion in a sworn deposition to congressional investigators on Tuesday and in earlier public statements.
19216	NYT_ENG_20080206.0095.LDC2009T13	After a nearly five-hour, closed-door deposition on Tuesday, Clemens told reporters, "It was great to be able to tell them what I've been saying all along -- that I've never used steroids or growth hormone."
19217	NYT_ENG_20080206.0095.LDC2009T13	McNamee's charges and Clemens' denials are the main focus of a congressional investigation that is heading toward a House Oversight committee hearing next Wednesday in which both men have agreed to testify under oath.

19219	NYT_ENG_20080210.0033.LDC2009T13	FOR A TRAVELING ATHLETE, PAYING TAXES IS A COMPLICATED BUSINESS
19220	NYT_ENG_20080210.0033.LDC2009T13	Derek Jeter, the New York Yankee shortstop, has resolved his problems with New York state tax collectors, state officials said last week.
19221	NYT_ENG_20080210.0033.LDC2009T13	Details of the settlement are not known, but the dispute revolved around a tax issue that is central for athletes and other itinerant workers: the official location of their permanent residence.
19222	NYT_ENG_20080210.0033.LDC2009T13	Jeter said he has lived for years near the New York Yankees' complex in Tampa, Fla., where there is no state income tax
19223	NYT_ENG_20080210.0033.LDC2009T13	New York state officials said that from 2001 through 2003, his residence was in Manhattan, and that he was therefore responsible for New York state income tax for that period.
19224	NYT_ENG_20080210.0033.LDC2009T13	Athletes who play in numerous out-of-town stadiums, as Jeter does, not only need to pin down their legal residence but they must also pay attention to another ticklish problem: which state is entitled to collect tax from them on any given day.
19225	NYT_ENG_20080210.0033.LDC2009T13	The results are often a tax return as thick as a phone book and as complex as a collateralized debt obligation.
19226	NYT_ENG_20080210.0033.LDC2009T13	In fact, states with nonresident income taxes treat players on visiting teams like workers in those states -- every time the team visits.
19227	NYT_ENG_20080210.0033.LDC2009T13	Given the combinations and permutations of league and interleague play, a player might have to file returns in more than a dozen states, and in Canada, too.
19228	NYT_ENG_20080210.0033.LDC2009T13	Team players in other sports, like football, basketball and hockey, and even professional tennis and golf players, are treated the same way.
19229	NYT_ENG_20080210.0033.LDC2009T13	So are entertainers and anyone else whose work life follows a similar pattern.
19230	NYT_ENG_20080210.0033.LDC2009T13	Complicating the task of figuring all this out is the concept of state tax credits.
19231	NYT_ENG_20080210.0033.LDC2009T13	If a player's home state has an income tax, it will allow him to deduct roughly what he has paid to other states from the amount owed the home state.
19232	NYT_ENG_20080210.0033.LDC2009T13	For example, Laurence I. Foster, a certified public accountant who is a consultant at Eisner L.L.P., said that "when the Yankees are playing in Cleveland, Cleveland taxes would apply."
19233	NYT_ENG_20080210.0033.LDC2009T13	They are deducted from New York taxes due on that income.
19234	NYT_ENG_20080210.0033.LDC2009T13	This makes hitting a 95-mph fastball look simple.
19235	NYT_ENG_20080210.0033.LDC2009T13	David Wright, the New York Mets' third baseman, said, "I try to understand taxes, or at least the basics of everything.
19236	NYT_ENG_20080210.0033.LDC2009T13	But there are things that I really can't 100 percent grasp."
19237	NYT_ENG_20080210.0033.LDC2009T13	That's why, he said, "I surround myself with people who do know the laws and the rules."
19238	NYT_ENG_20080210.0033.LDC2009T13	Doing so is in an athlete's interest, because the amounts involved are far from chump change.
19239	NYT_ENG_20080210.0033.LDC2009T13	A $20-million-a-year Boston Red Sox superstar who plays nine games at Yankee Stadium, for instance, might owe in the vicinity of $100,000 in New York state and New York City tax.
19240	NYT_ENG_20080210.0033.LDC2009T13	In Jeter's case, state records show that New York state brought a tax-collection civil proceeding against him in November, contending that he was a New York resident from 2001 to 2003.
19241	NYT_ENG_20080210.0033.LDC2009T13	State officials would not say why they zeroed in on only those years.
19242	NYT_ENG_20080210.0033.LDC2009T13	While playing for the Yankees, and staying in town between home games, would probably not be enough to establish residency in New York, state tax officials pointed to other actions, including the presence of many of Jeter's valued personal items in his apartment in the Trump World Tower building in Manhattan, and "public statements regarding his desire to be in New York," according to documents in the proceeding.
19243	NYT_ENG_20080210.0033.LDC2009T13	While a state official who had been briefed on the case said last week that it had been settled, he would not say what payment, if any, was required.
19244	NYT_ENG_20080210.0033.LDC2009T13	Tom Bergin, a spokesman for the State Department of Taxation and Finance, said the department had no comment on the matter.
19245	NYT_ENG_20080210.0033.LDC2009T13	Jeter's lawyer, Maria T. Jones, called the case "confidential" and declined to use the word "settlement."
19246	NYT_ENG_20080210.0033.LDC2009T13	Making clear that she was not talking specifically about the Jeter case, Jones said that multistate taxation of not only athletes and performers but even executives who travel often was "an important issue" nationwide, even when residency is not in question.
19247	NYT_ENG_20080210.0033.LDC2009T13	Multiple-state taxation is a "crazy hodgepodge of rules and systems," said Stephen W. Kidder, a lawyer in Boston who deals with the issue on behalf of the baseball, football and hockey players' unions.
19248	NYT_ENG_20080210.0033.LDC2009T13	"Virtually every state where the players play taxes visiting players on some percentage of their time and wages earned," he said.
19249	NYT_ENG_20080210.0033.LDC2009T13	If an athlete lives in a state like Florida that has no income tax, he pays each state visited the tax on the income attributable to those games, Foster said
19250	NYT_ENG_20080210.0033.LDC2009T13	there are no state tax credits in such a case.
19251	NYT_ENG_20080210.0033.LDC2009T13	A Florida resident playing for the Yankees, for example, would pay no tax on income earned while playing the Tampa Bay Rays, or while in spring training in Florida.
19252	NYT_ENG_20080210.0033.LDC2009T13	But if that player lived in New York, he would owe money on the Florida income, because New York taxes its residents on all their income, wherever it is earned.
19253	NYT_ENG_20080210.0033.LDC2009T13	Because of the complexity of the issues, it can take three to five times longer to prepare an athlete's return than another one with the same level of complexity on federal tax issues, according to Steve Blatt and Robert E.

19262	NYT_ENG_20080213.0114.LDC2009T13	Panamanian investigators have concluded that at least 174 people were poisoned, 115 of them fatally, by counterfeit cold medicine linked to an unlicensed Chinese chemical plant.
19263	NYT_ENG_20080213.0114.LDC2009T13	The report was the government's first effort to offer a precise toll of those killed and disabled in the mass poisoning in 2006.
19264	NYT_ENG_20080213.0114.LDC2009T13	But the head of the agency that prepared the report, Dr. Jose Vicente Pachar, said the number of victims was bound to be much higher because many in remote areas of the country were unlikely to report their cases to the government.
19265	NYT_ENG_20080213.0114.LDC2009T13	"The figures we have are the tip of the iceberg," Pachar, director of the Institute of Legal Medicine of Panama's Public Ministry, said in an interview.
19266	NYT_ENG_20080213.0114.LDC2009T13	"We will never know the full extent."
19267	NYT_ENG_20080213.0114.LDC2009T13	As if to underscore that point, a government agency that dispenses aid to victims found a higher number of poisoning victims: 184 so far, including 123 deaths.
19268	NYT_ENG_20080213.0114.LDC2009T13	More than 700 claims have been filed on behalf of possible poisoning victims.
19269	NYT_ENG_20080213.0114.LDC2009T13	Pachar's agency issued its report two weeks ago after investigating victims' claims and exhuming more than 50 bodies.
19270	NYT_ENG_20080213.0114.LDC2009T13	Previously, the government had estimated the death toll at 100.
19271	NYT_ENG_20080213.0114.LDC2009T13	The mass poisoning caused a political upheaval in Panama, partly because the government itself distributed the counterfeit medicine and because of questions over how vigorously the authorities sought to identify and help the victims.
19272	NYT_ENG_20080213.0114.LDC2009T13	One protest last summer turned violent when the police began clubbing families of victims who were trying to deliver a list of complaints to Panama's president.
19273	NYT_ENG_20080213.0114.LDC2009T13	The poisonings also brought new scrutiny to Chinese exports after The New York Times reported last May that a supposedly safe drug ingredient in the cold medicine actually contained diethylene glycol, an industrial solvent used in some antifreeze.
19274	NYT_ENG_20080213.0114.LDC2009T13	What is more, it was made by a Chinese chemical company that did not have a license to sell drug ingredients.
19275	NYT_ENG_20080213.0114.LDC2009T13	China's regulators initially said they had no legal grounds to take action against the manufacturer, but under rising international pressure the government closed the plant last year.
19276	NYT_ENG_20080213.0114.LDC2009T13	The families of some Panamanian victims have accused their government of trying to suppress the number of those harmed.
19277	NYT_ENG_20080213.0114.LDC2009T13	Gabriel Pascual, the leader of a group that represents victims and their families, criticized the government for ruling some cases inconclusive for poisoning without specifying their reasons.
19278	NYT_ENG_20080213.0114.LDC2009T13	Pascual cited seven examples of people he said had medical records certifying that they ingested the poison, yet who government investigators concluded were unaffected or had inconclusive evidence.
19279	NYT_ENG_20080213.0114.LDC2009T13	In 128 cases, the government said it lacked enough information to reach a definitive conclusion.
19280	NYT_ENG_20080213.0114.LDC2009T13	Pascual also criticized the slow pace of the exhumations.
19281	NYT_ENG_20080213.0114.LDC2009T13	The authorities said that they exhumed 52 bodies, and that 27 of those tested positive for diethylene glycol.
19282	NYT_ENG_20080213.0114.LDC2009T13	Asked why more bodies were not exhumed, Pachar said the tests were expensive, adding: "The institute's budget is about $3 million for the whole year.
19283	NYT_ENG_20080213.0114.LDC2009T13	The government spends almost $4 million on Carnival."
19284	NYT_ENG_20080213.0114.LDC2009T13	Pachar, whose report is being used by prosecutors in criminal cases they have filed against 16 Panamanians involved in the handling and distribution of the toxic syrup, said it was impossible to identify all the possible victims.
19285	NYT_ENG_20080213.0114.LDC2009T13	"People in the countryside who live far from the modern sectors of Panama tend to think of death as a matter of God's will," he said.
19286	NYT_ENG_20080213.0114.LDC2009T13	"They tend not to report deaths that we might find suspicious."
19287	NYT_ENG_20080213.0114.LDC2009T13	He said his investigation was 95 percent complete.
19288	NYT_ENG_20080213.0114.LDC2009T13	Elida de Gonzalez, the chief social worker for the Victims' Support Office, said her agency confirmed a different number of victims than Pachar's agency because the two investigated independently.
19289	NYT_ENG_20080213.0114.LDC2009T13	Gonzalez speculated that her agency's number was higher because people might be more willing to report their cases to an agency that provides financial aid.
19290	NYT_ENG_20080213.0114.LDC2009T13	Pascual, the representative of the victims' group, said he was injured during a demonstration on July 19, 2007, when the police used billy clubs to stop the group from presenting a petition listing its complaints to President Martin Torrijos.
19291	NYT_ENG_20080213.0114.LDC2009T13	Pascual said one person was hospitalized and seven others were treated and released.
19292	NYT_ENG_20080213.0114.LDC2009T13	Afterward, the government apologized.
19293	NYT_ENG_20080213.0114.LDC2009T13	"It's really sad and lamentable what happened," Torrijos said in a statement to the press.
19294	NYT_ENG_20080213.0114.LDC2009T13	The poisonings occurred after a Chinese factory sold 46 barrels of toxic syrup to a Beijing broker, owned by China's government.
19295	NYT_ENG_20080213.0114.LDC2009T13	It then sold the mislabeled syrup to another broker in Barcelona, who passed it on to a Panamanian broker, who sold the barrels to a Panamanian health service.
19296	NYT_ENG_20080213.0114.LDC2009T13	It unwittingly mixed the diethylene glycol into 260,000 bottles of cold medicine.
19297	NYT_ENG_20080213.0114.LDC2009T13	No one in China has been prosecuted for selling the counterfeit syrup.
19298	NYT_ENG_20080213.0114.LDC2009T13	The same poison, diethylene glycol, was later detected in Chinese-made toothpaste sold in Panama, setting off a worldwide hunt for tainted toothpaste.
19299	NYT_ENG_20080213.0114.LDC2009T13	Last year nearly three dozen countries, including the United States, issued health alerts or product recalls after finding diethylene glycol in Chinese toothpaste.
19300	NYT_ENG_20080213.0114.LDC2009T13	China's government responded by banning the use of diethylene glycol in toothpaste.

19302	NYT_ENG_20080227.0187.LDC2009T13	Abu Dhabi has 10 percent of the world's oil and 0.02 percent of its population.
19303	NYT_ENG_20080227.0187.LDC2009T13	The result is a surfeit of petrodollars, much of which is funneled into a secretive, government-controlled investment fund that is helping to shift the balance of power in the financial world.
19304	NYT_ENG_20080227.0187.LDC2009T13	After decades in the shadows, the fund, the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, is turning heads on Wall Street and in Washington by making high-profile investments in the United States and elsewhere.
19305	NYT_ENG_20080227.0187.LDC2009T13	Known as ADIA (pronounced ah-DEE-ah), the fund recently formed a small team that is now buying big stakes in Western companies.
19306	NYT_ENG_20080227.0187.LDC2009T13	This unit masterminded ADIA's $7.5 billion investment in Citigroup, the largest U.S. bank, in November.
19307	NYT_ENG_20080227.0187.LDC2009T13	It has also taken a large position in Toll Brothers, one of America's biggest home builders.
19308	NYT_ENG_20080227.0187.LDC2009T13	"There is an idea that Abu Dhabi should not be the underdog of the map," said Frauke Heard-Bey, a historian who has written a book about the political emergence of the United Arab Emirates.
19309	NYT_ENG_20080227.0187.LDC2009T13	"They have the money to buy companies that are ailing, and why should they not?
19310	NYT_ENG_20080227.0187.LDC2009T13	Why not make a mark?"
19311	NYT_ENG_20080227.0187.LDC2009T13	ADIA is the largest of the world's sovereign wealth funds, giant pools of money controlled by cash-rich governments, particularly in Asia and Middle East.
19312	NYT_ENG_20080227.0187.LDC2009T13	But Abu Dhabi, the wealthiest of the seven Arab emirates, says little about its fund.
19313	NYT_ENG_20080227.0187.LDC2009T13	Few outsiders know for sure where ADIA invests -- or even how much money it controls.
19314	NYT_ENG_20080227.0187.LDC2009T13	And secrecy breeds hyperbole
19315	NYT_ENG_20080227.0187.LDC2009T13	some estimates of the fund's size surpass $1 trillion.
19316	NYT_ENG_20080227.0187.LDC2009T13	Before long, ADIA will certainly reach that mark.
19317	NYT_ENG_20080227.0187.LDC2009T13	But for now bankers, former employees and analysts familiar with the fund peg it at $650 billion to $700 billion -- an amount that is still more than 15 times the size of the Fidelity Magellan Fund.
19318	NYT_ENG_20080227.0187.LDC2009T13	In all, sovereign wealth funds in countries like the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Singapore, China and Russia together control more than $2 trillion, a figure that could approach $12 trillion by 2015, analysts say.
19319	NYT_ENG_20080227.0187.LDC2009T13	Such riches, coupled with the more-aggressive stance being taken by ADIA and other sovereign funds, has raised concern that these investors will wield their wealth for political as well as financial reasons.
19320	NYT_ENG_20080227.0187.LDC2009T13	ADIA's secrecy is also drawing scrutiny.
19321	NYT_ENG_20080227.0187.LDC2009T13	The fund has no internal communications department, although it says it is in the process of setting one up.
19322	NYT_ENG_20080227.0187.LDC2009T13	When sovereign fund leaders from around the world descended on Davos, Switzerland, in February for the World Economic Forum, no one from ADIA saw fit to show up.
19323	NYT_ENG_20080227.0187.LDC2009T13	Executives at ADIA declined to comment for this article.
19324	NYT_ENG_20080227.0187.LDC2009T13	Last week Sen. Evan Bayh, D-Ind., the chairman of the Senate subcommittee on security and international trade and finance, who has raised concerns about sovereign fund transparency, traveled to Abu Dhabi to meet with senior ADIA executives.
19325	NYT_ENG_20080227.0187.LDC2009T13	Also last week, a delegation led by Clay Lowery, a top Treasury official, met with ADIA executives as part of a dialogue to formalize investment guidelines for sovereign funds.
19326	NYT_ENG_20080227.0187.LDC2009T13	In many ways the tension between ADIA's elephantine size -- the fund is twice as big as Norway's, the second-largest sovereign fund -- and its demure aspect is underscored by its investment in Citigroup.
19327	NYT_ENG_20080227.0187.LDC2009T13	Since ADIA's genesis in 1976, the fund has followed a conservative investment approach.
19328	NYT_ENG_20080227.0187.LDC2009T13	It has farmed out its assets to foreign money managers and taken stakes in companies based upon their weighting in benchmark stock indexes like the Standard &amp

19330	NYT_ENG_20080227.0187.LDC2009T13	Poor's 500.
19331	NYT_ENG_20080227.0187.LDC2009T13	ADIA is also one of the largest institutional investors in hedge funds and private-equity funds.
19332	NYT_ENG_20080227.0187.LDC2009T13	This approach has served ADIA well and reflects the strongly felt notion that the fund's ultimate purpose is to serve as a financial reserve for Abu Dhabi in times when oil revenues are less robust.
19333	NYT_ENG_20080227.0187.LDC2009T13	Nevertheless, guided by the advice of a stream of foreign bankers who worked at ADIA in the 1970s and 1980s, the fund has allocated a large portion of its assets to equities.
19334	NYT_ENG_20080227.0187.LDC2009T13	It now has about 65 percent of assets, or about $450 billion, invested in stocks, according to bankers.
19335	NYT_ENG_20080227.0187.LDC2009T13	Currently, the fund averages a yearly return of 10 to 20 percent, say people who have been briefed on the fund's investment strategy.
19336	NYT_ENG_20080227.0187.LDC2009T13	With oil about $100 a barrel, bankers and analysts estimate Abu Dhabi produces a surplus of at least $50 billion a year.
19337	NYT_ENG_20080227.0187.LDC2009T13	Given the emirate's small population, 80 percent of which is foreign born, even the most expansive investment and welfare policies make it hard to put a dent in such a sum.
19338	NYT_ENG_20080227.0187.LDC2009T13	The United States is not a big buyer of Abu Dhabi's oil, most of which goes to Asia, but the surplus is a vivid reminder of the U.S. economy's own fiscal imbalance, to say nothing of its diminishing global stature, a theme that underpins much of the political worry surrounding sovereign fund investments.
19339	NYT_ENG_20080227.0187.LDC2009T13	"In the short run, that they are investing here is good," Bayh said.
19340	NYT_ENG_20080227.0187.LDC2009T13	"But in the long run it is unsustainable.
19341	NYT_ENG_20080227.0187.LDC2009T13	Our power and authority is eroding because of the amounts we are sending abroad for energy and consumer goods."
19342	NYT_ENG_20080227.0187.LDC2009T13	In the past, much of Abu Dhabi's cash surplus has gone to ADIA, although the formation two years ago of a smaller sister fund, the Abu Dhabi Investment Council, has resulted in a lesser amount flowing to ADIA, analysts say.
19343	NYT_ENG_20080227.0187.LDC2009T13	But ADIA's new strategic investment group represents the clearest sign that the fund is taking steps to leverage its size and influence.
19344	NYT_ENG_20080227.0187.LDC2009T13	The division was set up in the summer of 2006 and is overseen by Saeed Mubarek Rashid al-Hajiri, a young, Western- educated portfolio manager who also heads the fund's considerable investments in emerging-market economies.
19345	NYT_ENG_20080227.0187.LDC2009T13	In addition to Citigroup and Toll Brothers, in which AIDA took a 4.5 percent position last summer, other companies in the group's portfolio include EFG Hermes, one of the leading investment banks in the Arab world, and Banque de Tunisie et des Emirats, a Tunisian bank.
19346	NYT_ENG_20080227.0187.LDC2009T13	Instead of passively tracking indexes, this unit actively picks investments in hopes of generating market-beating returns.
19347	NYT_ENG_20080227.0187.LDC2009T13	It is a method of stock picking practiced by most hedge funds and asset management companies, and the Citigroup investment, with its size and attendant risk, is a good example of this approach.
19348	NYT_ENG_20080227.0187.LDC2009T13	Compared with the overall fund, the assets within this group are small at about $30 billion, according to people who have been briefed on ADIA's strategy.
19349	NYT_ENG_20080227.0187.LDC2009T13	As with all its investments, ADIA adopts a long-term, passive approach and does not seek board seats.
19350	NYT_ENG_20080227.0187.LDC2009T13	These people say that outsiders still manage 80 percent of ADIA's assets, proof that the fund's commitment to making direct investments is only in its early stages.
19351	NYT_ENG_20080227.0187.LDC2009T13	This hesitation partly reflects the lack of a strong individual within the organization who has the combination of investment experience, trust of the royal family and a bit of international swagger to assume a larger public presence.
19352	NYT_ENG_20080227.0187.LDC2009T13	Sheik Khalifa bin Zayed al-Nahyan, the president of the United Arab Emirates and the ruler of Abu Dhabi, while chairman of the fund, has a cautious and reserved disposition and does not take an active role in ADIA.
19353	NYT_ENG_20080227.0187.LDC2009T13	When Citigroup's chairman, Robert E. Rubin, traveled to Abu Dhabi last November, his courtesy call was made to Sheik Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan, the crown prince of Abu Dhabi and the point person for the United States-Abu Dhabi relationship.
19354	NYT_ENG_20080227.0187.LDC2009T13	The fund's managing director is Sheik Ahmed bin Zayed al-Nahyan, a half-brother of Sheik Khalifa who maintains a full-floor office in ADIA's sleek 40-story headquarters.
19355	NYT_ENG_20080227.0187.LDC2009T13	People familiar with ADIA management, however, say the sheik, who has worked at ADIA for 10 years, delegates significant authority to Jean-Paul Villain, a publicity-shy French money manager who directs investment strategy and asset allocation.
19356	NYT_ENG_20080227.0187.LDC2009T13	Villain, the most senior foreign-born executive at the fund, first joined ADIA in the early 1980s from the French bank Paribas.
19357	NYT_ENG_20080227.0187.LDC2009T13	While other expatriates have come and gone, Villain has stayed, except for a brief period in the mid-1980s.
19358	NYT_ENG_20080227.0187.LDC2009T13	More so than the other foreigners, Villain, whose wife is Syrian-born, has gained the royal family's trust.
19359	NYT_ENG_20080227.0187.LDC2009T13	One view is that ADIA's penchant for secrecy stems from its experience during the scandal at the Bank of Credit &amp

19362	NYT_ENG_20080227.0187.LDC2009T13	The al-Nahyan family became embroiled in regulatory investigations, although no charges were ever brought against them.
19363	NYT_ENG_20080227.0187.LDC2009T13	But people who worked at ADIA from its earliest days in the late 1970s and 1980s say that the fund's reticence dates to its formation.
19364	NYT_ENG_20080227.0187.LDC2009T13	Some see this as a reflection of Abu Dhabi's small size, insular culture and geographical vulnerability, a sense that the less that is known about the specifics of ADIA's hoard, the better.
19365	NYT_ENG_20080227.0187.LDC2009T13	"ADIA does not answer to a wide public at home," said David L. Mack, a former United States ambassador to the United Arab Emirates.

19369	NYT_ENG_20080323.0060.LDC2009T13	ST. PETERSBURG RHPs Jason Hammel and Edwin Jackson seemed likely as much by being out of options as anything else to retain their spots in the Rays rotation, at least to start the season.
19370	NYT_ENG_20080323.0060.LDC2009T13	But RHP Andy Sonnanstine had to win his the old-fashioned way, and as the result of his strong spring (a 0.64 ERA, .163 average and two walks in 14 innings), and the absence of ace Scott Kazmir, Sonnanstine was named Saturday as the No.
19371	NYT_ENG_20080323.0060.LDC2009T13	??
19372	NYT_ENG_20080323.0060.LDC2009T13	3 starter behind James Shields and Matt Garza.
19373	NYT_ENG_20080323.0060.LDC2009T13	The decision was something of a surprise, especially to Sonnanstine, who wasn't sure of his role as he was used in relief in four of his six spring outings.
19374	NYT_ENG_20080323.0060.LDC2009T13	"It's been a little stressful for me this whole spring training just not knowing," he said, "but maybe that caused me to work a little bit harder."
19375	NYT_ENG_20080323.0060.LDC2009T13	But manager Joe Maddon said it was a matter of wanting to see other pitchers first, and having a pretty good idea of how well Sonnanstine, who turned 25 Tuesday, would respond and compete.
19376	NYT_ENG_20080323.0060.LDC2009T13	"I have a lot of confidence in him," Maddon said.
19377	NYT_ENG_20080323.0060.LDC2009T13	"He just has been a survivor.
19378	NYT_ENG_20080323.0060.LDC2009T13	He's always been the last guy to make teams, and then he always goes out and performs well.
19379	NYT_ENG_20080323.0060.LDC2009T13	He's got to prove himself on an annual basis, and he does.
19380	NYT_ENG_20080323.0060.LDC2009T13	And I think because of that, this guy has built up a certain toughness about him that maybe some other people lack."
19381	NYT_ENG_20080323.0060.LDC2009T13	The Rays made the rotation official by optioning RHP Jeff Niemann to Triple A ("He made a great case for himself," Maddon said) and targeting LHP J.P. Howell for the long-relief role.
19382	NYT_ENG_20080323.0060.LDC2009T13	("He really fits the requirements," Maddon said.)
19383	NYT_ENG_20080323.0060.LDC2009T13	They haven't decided whether Jackson or Hammel will be No. 4.
19384	NYT_ENG_20080323.0060.LDC2009T13	When Kazmir returns perhaps late April, though no one seems to know for sure the Rays will have to drop someone, and Maddon said the evaluation process will be ongoing and the requirements to stay higher than in the past.
19385	NYT_ENG_20080323.0060.LDC2009T13	Hammel (0-1, 7.13 ERA
19386	NYT_ENG_20080323.0060.LDC2009T13	21 hits, nine walks in 172/3 IP) said, candidly, he didn't deserve to make the rotation based on his spring work and was determined to show he was worthy: "It's my job now to prove the decision right."
19387	NYT_ENG_20080323.0060.LDC2009T13	Jackson (0-1, 5.40 ERA
19388	NYT_ENG_20080323.0060.LDC2009T13	13 hits, seven walks in 162/3 IP) said he welcomed the opportunity and didn't care where he slotted in the rotation.
19389	NYT_ENG_20080323.0060.LDC2009T13	ON DECK: Niemann was disappointed but felt he made a good enough impression (going 2-0, 1.50 and heeding the requests to keep the ball down) that he could get back soon.

19392	NYT_ENG_20080323.0060.LDC2009T13	"I'm not going to be disappointed in whatever decision they make," Longoria said.

19396	NYT_ENG_20080323.0060.LDC2009T13	MISCELLANY: Saturday's game was canceled due to rain with the Pirates leading 2-0 after two innings.
19397	NYT_ENG_20080323.0060.LDC2009T13	Maddon said Kazmir keeps "getting better" but remains limited to playing catch, and there is still no timetable for him to return to the mound.

19447	NYT_ENG_20080407.0166.LDC2009T13	President Bush urged Congress on Monday to resist efforts by Democrats to pass a second economic stimulus package, saying that while the economy is "in a rough time right now," he is confident it will begin to rebound by the end of the year.
19448	NYT_ENG_20080407.0166.LDC2009T13	On his first day back from a swing through Eastern Europe and Russia, Bush summoned small-business leaders to the White House to showcase the first stimulus package, signed into law in February.
19449	NYT_ENG_20080407.0166.LDC2009T13	That package included rebates for taxpayers -- the White House says the checks will start to go out next month -- and tax incentives intended to encourage businesses to invest.

19452	NYT_ENG_20080407.0166.LDC2009T13	But in the wake of a bleak report on Friday that showed 80,000 jobs were lost in March, Democrats say there is no time to waste.
19453	NYT_ENG_20080407.0166.LDC2009T13	The House speaker, Nancy Pelosi of California, has called on Bush to work with Congress in passing a new stimulus bill and has said she will raise the issue with Bush directly at a meeting scheduled for Wednesday at the White House.
19454	NYT_ENG_20080407.0166.LDC2009T13	Pelosi is proposing a package that would include an extension of unemployment benefits, a provision that the White House opposed in negotiations over the first stimulus package.
19455	NYT_ENG_20080407.0166.LDC2009T13	At the same time, Senate Democrats and Republicans are working together on a housing bill to help struggling homeowners avert foreclosure
19456	NYT_ENG_20080407.0166.LDC2009T13	the White House says it has "deep concerns" about that legislation.
19457	NYT_ENG_20080407.0166.LDC2009T13	In pushing back against additional government intervention in the economy, Bush is drawing a sharp contrast between himself and Democrats, who intend to make rising unemployment and the economic downturn a centerpiece of their fall election campaigns.
19458	NYT_ENG_20080407.0166.LDC2009T13	But he could be making life difficult for Republicans, who will face questions from voters about what they are doing to make life better for ordinary Americans and who will have to decide whether to stick with the White House or break with Bush when the housing and stimulus bills come up for votes.
19459	NYT_ENG_20080407.0166.LDC2009T13	At Monday's White House event, Bush commended a group of businessmen and women who said tax incentives had led them to invest more in their companies.
19460	NYT_ENG_20080407.0166.LDC2009T13	But he conceded that Americans remained concerned, saying "not only are people worried about their homes, they're worried about the cost of fuel."

19463	NYT_ENG_20080416.0147.LDC2009T13	Iraqis often complain about the problems in their country and the government's lack of obvious progress in solving them.
19464	NYT_ENG_20080416.0147.LDC2009T13	But as drivers in traffic-clogged Baghdad learned this week, Iraqi officials are taking action in one area: strict enforcement of a seat belt law.
19465	NYT_ENG_20080416.0147.LDC2009T13	Later this month, traffic police officers all over Iraq will start issuing tickets to any scofflaw who drives without buckling up.
19466	NYT_ENG_20080416.0147.LDC2009T13	Violators will be fined 15,000 dinars -- about $12.50.
19467	NYT_ENG_20080416.0147.LDC2009T13	"It is part of the healing process of this country and of Baghdad to enforce the law, law by law," said Brig. Gen. Zuhair Abada Mraweh, traffic commander for the capital's Rusafah district.
19468	NYT_ENG_20080416.0147.LDC2009T13	"The citizens are learning the laws step by step," said Mraweh, sitting in his office in the Karada neighborhood.
19469	NYT_ENG_20080416.0147.LDC2009T13	"We have applied all the laws concerning traffic, so it's time for the seat belt law to be practiced."
19470	NYT_ENG_20080416.0147.LDC2009T13	Some might say that that there are more pressing issues, like the car bombs that can turn a morning commute into a nightmare of blood and body parts, the daily killings and kidnappings, the political and sectarian infighting.
19471	NYT_ENG_20080416.0147.LDC2009T13	Or that enforcing the seat belt law might not be an adequate solution in a city where traffic rarely moves above a crawl, checkpoints are ubiquitous, roads are often blocked and it is not uncommon to see a vehicle charging down a street in the wrong direction or abruptly swerving across lanes.
19472	NYT_ENG_20080416.0147.LDC2009T13	Still, brigades of traffic officers trying valiantly to do their jobs have been a constant in an ever-changing landscape of war and chaos over the last five years.
19473	NYT_ENG_20080416.0147.LDC2009T13	And as traffic police officers warned Baghdad drivers earlier this week that seat belt enforcement was about to begin, many drivers said it was probably a good thing.
19474	NYT_ENG_20080416.0147.LDC2009T13	"It is a symbol of civilization," said a taxi driver, Ahmed Wahayid, whose 1993 Honda Elantra was stuck in a long line of cars waiting to clear a checkpoint.
19475	NYT_ENG_20080416.0147.LDC2009T13	"Western people in Europe and America have it, so we are like them."
19476	NYT_ENG_20080416.0147.LDC2009T13	Wahayid said he could not find words to describe the traffic in Baghdad.
19477	NYT_ENG_20080416.0147.LDC2009T13	"It's a very, very bad feeling, and if I didn't need to drive in order to eat and live I wouldn't," he said.
19478	NYT_ENG_20080416.0147.LDC2009T13	Hussain Fathil, 35, trying to guide his 1991 Opel through the logjam, put it more briefly: "It pulls your heart apart," he said.
19479	NYT_ENG_20080416.0147.LDC2009T13	But he doubted whether enforcing the seat belt law would help.
19480	NYT_ENG_20080416.0147.LDC2009T13	"Do you want to know my opinion?'
19481	NYT_ENG_20080416.0147.LDC2009T13	he said.
19482	NYT_ENG_20080416.0147.LDC2009T13	"This law cannot be applied in such a city."
19483	NYT_ENG_20080416.0147.LDC2009T13	But he had his seat belt on and said that he would keep wearing it.
19484	NYT_ENG_20080416.0147.LDC2009T13	"It's the law," he said.
19485	NYT_ENG_20080416.0147.LDC2009T13	Mraweh said that the seat belt legislation -- which applies only to drivers, not passengers -- was in effect during the government of Saddam Hussein.
19486	NYT_ENG_20080416.0147.LDC2009T13	After the Americans invaded in 2003, a high import tax on automobiles was lifted, flooding Iraq with enthusiastic new drivers.
19487	NYT_ENG_20080416.0147.LDC2009T13	He said there were no dependable statistics on traffic accidents, but that enforcing the law would reduce them by 70 percent.
19488	NYT_ENG_20080416.0147.LDC2009T13	Mraweh is passionate about traffic control.
19489	NYT_ENG_20080416.0147.LDC2009T13	He is particularly irked by the driving behavior by the employees of security companies like Blackwater, who sometimes throw water bottles at people walking down the street or shoot their guns in the air to clear the road, he said.
19490	NYT_ENG_20080416.0147.LDC2009T13	But primarily, Mraweh sees his job as a way to piece together his shattered country.
19491	NYT_ENG_20080416.0147.LDC2009T13	"If everyone says there are killings, there are massacres, then I will stay powerless at home and this will disable the country," he said.
19492	NYT_ENG_20080416.0147.LDC2009T13	"But if the grocer goes to work, the merchant goes to work, I go to work, even you go to work, there will be no more killing, and the criminal will be afraid and he will go back to his den like a mouse"

19494	NYT_ENG_20080417.0146.LDC2009T13	NEW YORK
19495	NYT_ENG_20080417.0146.LDC2009T13	There are a lot of horses but absolutely no sense in "The First Saturday in May," a glib, lazy documentary about six trainers on the proverbial road to the 2006 Kentucky Derby.
19496	NYT_ENG_20080417.0146.LDC2009T13	This is, after all, a movie about horse trainers that tells you next to nothing about what horse trainers do besides stand around paddocks, issuing vague instructions to the grooms or staring nervously, wistfully and stoically at the racetrack.
19497	NYT_ENG_20080417.0146.LDC2009T13	Do the trainers determine a horse's feed or its racing schedule?
19498	NYT_ENG_20080417.0146.LDC2009T13	Do they choose the drugs that are regularly pumped into these magnificent animals?
19499	NYT_ENG_20080417.0146.LDC2009T13	Or do the owners make those calls?
19500	NYT_ENG_20080417.0146.LDC2009T13	Don't look here for answers.
19501	NYT_ENG_20080417.0146.LDC2009T13	These questions seem especially pertinent because one of the six trainers is Michael Matz, who trained Barbaro.
19502	NYT_ENG_20080417.0146.LDC2009T13	On May 6, 2006, after having been raced only once in the previous 13 weeks, Barbaro won the Derby by a thrillingly wide margin
19503	NYT_ENG_20080417.0146.LDC2009T13	two weeks later he was run in the Preakness Stakes (the second race in the Triple Crown), where he sustained the leg injury that eventually led to his being euthanized.
19504	NYT_ENG_20080417.0146.LDC2009T13	His death generated the usual blather: one so-called expert noted that all sports entail risk, while ignoring that it's only animals that also risk being put down.
19505	NYT_ENG_20080417.0146.LDC2009T13	But there was also some soul-searching from trainers and sportswriters who wondered if thoroughbreds were unnecessarily being placed in harm's way.
19506	NYT_ENG_20080417.0146.LDC2009T13	Barbaro was apparently on a legal diuretic when he was raced at the Preakness.
19507	NYT_ENG_20080417.0146.LDC2009T13	There is no evidence that drugs played a role in his injury.
19508	NYT_ENG_20080417.0146.LDC2009T13	Yet the debate over racing thoroughbreds on any drugs is precisely the kind of issue that you would expect to be addressed -- much less mentioned -- in a documentary that features what would soon be the most famous dead horse in America since Ruffian, the spectacular filly who was fatally injured in 1975.
19509	NYT_ENG_20080417.0146.LDC2009T13	Horse racing is a sensationally exciting spectator sport, of course, but it's also a troubled one filled with dirty little half-kept secrets.
19510	NYT_ENG_20080417.0146.LDC2009T13	Almost two horses die for every 1,000 starts in this country, which adds up to a lot of dead animals.
19511	NYT_ENG_20080417.0146.LDC2009T13	In making this, their feature debut, the brothers John and Brad Hennegan were not obliged to create a documentary about doping and death in thoroughbred racing.
19512	NYT_ENG_20080417.0146.LDC2009T13	But given that they don't address even the basics of horse training in a movie about horse trainers, you have to wonder what they thought they were making.
19513	NYT_ENG_20080417.0146.LDC2009T13	They clearly enjoy the company of the trainers, some of whom come across rather better than others, notably Kiaran McLaughlin, who trained Jazil, the winner of the 2006 Belmont Stakes, the third leg of the Triple Crown.
19514	NYT_ENG_20080417.0146.LDC2009T13	Yet the filmmakers remain strangely incurious about these six men, who have all staked their careers on expensive, scarily fragile, four-legged animals that they don't own and, in some cases, seem basically indifferent to.
19515	NYT_ENG_20080417.0146.LDC2009T13	If Barbaro weren't one of the main attractions in "The First Saturday in May," and if his name weren't being used in the marketing, the movie's lapses might be forgivable.
19516	NYT_ENG_20080417.0146.LDC2009T13	It would still be a bad documentary, marred by dribbling camerawork and pointless choices -- a ha-ha scene of one trainer golfing with hard liquor and a fat cousin, filler images of Derby crowds in wacky hats and far too many shots of the trainers staring into the distance -- but it wouldn't smack of exploitation.
19517	NYT_ENG_20080417.0146.LDC2009T13	Then again, given that one of the movie's distributors is Churchill Downs Inc., which owns and operates racetracks and is the host of the Derby, it's no wonder that this feels like a feature-length commercial for the horse racing industry.
19518	NYT_ENG_20080417.0146.LDC2009T13	It is.

19528	NYT_ENG_20080417.0231.LDC2009T13	A suicide bomber struck outside a mosque in southwestern Afghanistan on Thursday, killing 23 people, including two senior police officials and several children, officials said Thursday evening.
19529	NYT_ENG_20080417.0231.LDC2009T13	An estimated 31 people were wounded in the explosion, which occurred just before evening prayers in the border town of Zaranj, the capital of Nimruz Province.
19530	NYT_ENG_20080417.0231.LDC2009T13	Nimruz is a remote desert area, sparsely populated and poorly policed, where traffickers smuggle drugs across into neighboring Iran.
19531	NYT_ENG_20080417.0231.LDC2009T13	There has also been an increase in insurgent activity in the province.
19532	NYT_ENG_20080417.0231.LDC2009T13	Many of those killed and wounded were civilians, shopkeepers and guests at a hotel, the provincial governor, Ghulam Dastagir Azad, said by telephone.
19533	NYT_ENG_20080417.0231.LDC2009T13	He said he believed that police officials had been the bomber's targets.
19534	NYT_ENG_20080417.0231.LDC2009T13	One of those killed was Bismillah Khan, a district police chief, and another was the commander of a battalion of border guards, he said.
19535	NYT_ENG_20080417.0231.LDC2009T13	"They are the enemy of the poor people, the enemy of human beings," the governor said of the attackers.
19536	NYT_ENG_20080417.0231.LDC2009T13	Also on Thursday, the American military said that two U.S. Marines from a unit that arrived last month had been killed and that two were wounded Wednesday morning when an explosion hit their convoy in the southern province of Kandahar.
19537	NYT_ENG_20080417.0231.LDC2009T13	Under NATO rules their nationality was not released immediately, said Capt. Kelly Frushour, the unit's public affairs officer.
19538	NYT_ENG_20080417.0231.LDC2009T13	She gave few details of the episode except to say it had been a hostile attack, and that the wounded were being sent to the American military base at Landstuhl, Germany.
19539	NYT_ENG_20080417.0231.LDC2009T13	The Marines came from the 24th Marine Expeditionary Unit, a force of 3,200 that was sent to Afghanistan recently to help NATO troops faced with a continued insurgency in southern and eastern Afghanistan.
19540	NYT_ENG_20080417.0231.LDC2009T13	NATO commanders in Afghanistan have called for more forces repeatedly over the last two years, but were rebuffed until the Marine unit arrived.
19541	NYT_ENG_20080417.0231.LDC2009T13	The Marines came with their own artillery, helicopters and Harrier fighter planes, and were expected to add considerable combat capability to the NATO forces, which have struggled to contain the Taliban insurgency since being deployed in 2006.
19542	NYT_ENG_20080417.0231.LDC2009T13	About 2,200 of the Marines will work with NATO forces and serve as a task force capable of being used across the country as needed.
19543	NYT_ENG_20080417.0231.LDC2009T13	The remaining 1,000 will provide training and support for the Afghan army and police forces under U.S. command.
19544	NYT_ENG_20080417.0231.LDC2009T13	The Marine unit has been stationed at an air base just outside the city of Kandahar, and has yet to see combat.
19545	NYT_ENG_20080417.0231.LDC2009T13	In comments reported in The Baltimore Sun, members of the unit complained recently that the slow and cumbersome NATO command structure had delayed them from being utilized, and that they had been wasting time on the base rather than fighting insurgents.

19547	NYT_ENG_20080421.0149.LDC2009T13	Somewhere in between the parade of busty women in low-cut gold lame minidresses and contestants spinning the wheel, George Bush made a star turn.
19548	NYT_ENG_20080421.0149.LDC2009T13	"I'm thrilled to be on 'Deal or No Deal' with you tonight," Bush said from a giant screen in a cameo taped for the Monday episode of one of NBC's most popular prime-time shows.
19549	NYT_ENG_20080421.0149.LDC2009T13	The president paused a beat.
19550	NYT_ENG_20080421.0149.LDC2009T13	"Come to think of it, I'm thrilled to be anywhere with high ratings these days."
19551	NYT_ENG_20080421.0149.LDC2009T13	Elitism is to the 2008 campaign as communism was to 1950s politics: a career breaker.
19552	NYT_ENG_20080421.0149.LDC2009T13	And pop TV is the antidote, a free platform to rub shoulders with viewers who only glancingly pay attention to the news.
19553	NYT_ENG_20080421.0149.LDC2009T13	Making nice on a cooking program or game show is the macropopulist equivalent of knocking down pins in a bowling alley in Altoona, Pa., or belting down Crown Royal whiskey in a bar in Crown Point, Ind., only better: the setting, be it Rachael Ray's kitchen or Howie Mandel's array of suitcases on "Deal or No Deal," is as familiar as home to millions of viewers.
19554	NYT_ENG_20080421.0149.LDC2009T13	None of the presidential candidates want to be seen as snooty or overeducated, which must be why on Monday all three provided taped greetings to wrestling fans watching "WWE Raw" on the USA network.
19555	NYT_ENG_20080421.0149.LDC2009T13	Even a president can do a stint on a lowbrow entertainment show as long as it is cloaked in a dignified cause.
19556	NYT_ENG_20080421.0149.LDC2009T13	The "Deal or No Deal" contestant Bush rooted for, Joe Kobes, is a decorated Army captain who served three tours in Iraq.
19557	NYT_ENG_20080421.0149.LDC2009T13	Timing, however, matters.
19558	NYT_ENG_20080421.0149.LDC2009T13	While it may be the first time a sitting president found it fitting to make fun of himself on a game show, that showstopper came at a moment when the Bush presidency is in eclipse.
19559	NYT_ENG_20080421.0149.LDC2009T13	The first lady, Laura Bush, is scheduled to serve as an NBC co- host on "Today" on Tuesday, but she was outflanked by her would- be Republican successor, Cindy McCain, who on Monday was a guest co-host of "The View" on ABC and shared some secrets about her husband.
19560	NYT_ENG_20080421.0149.LDC2009T13	(Cindy McCain said that the man she calls "Johnny-Boy" loves horticulture and cooking and contrary to news reports does not have a "temper" problem.)
19561	NYT_ENG_20080421.0149.LDC2009T13	Michelle Obama, who last week stood up for her husband's common touch on "The Colbert Report," tried to prove it by taping a segment of "Rachael Ray" alongside Barack Obama on Monday.
19562	NYT_ENG_20080421.0149.LDC2009T13	The episode is expected to run in May.
19563	NYT_ENG_20080421.0149.LDC2009T13	Hillary Rodham Clinton performed a self-mocking skit on "The Colbert Report" last week (not to be confused with her self- mocking skit on "Saturday Night Live," on March 1) and agreed to appear on "Larry King Live" on CNN on Monday night.
19564	NYT_ENG_20080421.0149.LDC2009T13	Obama accepted a seat, for the third time, on "The Daily Show With Jon Stewart."
19565	NYT_ENG_20080421.0149.LDC2009T13	The novelty of politicians showing their lighter side on national television has begun to weigh heavily on the campaign season.
19566	NYT_ENG_20080421.0149.LDC2009T13	The surprise lies not in who does which show, but who doesn't do them at all, and at this point only the pope has held out.
19567	NYT_ENG_20080421.0149.LDC2009T13	It's hard to recall how unusual it was to see Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas playing the sax on "The Arsenio Hall Show" in 1992 or Bush revealing his favorite sandwich (peanut butter and jelly on white bread) on "Oprah" during the 2000 campaign.
19568	NYT_ENG_20080421.0149.LDC2009T13	Some candidates, however, are bigger hams than others.
19569	NYT_ENG_20080421.0149.LDC2009T13	McCain had a walk-on part on the Fox drama "24" in 2006, and played himself as a wedding guest in the 2005 film comedy "Wedding Crashers."
19570	NYT_ENG_20080421.0149.LDC2009T13	In politics as in show business too many appearances can weaken their value: All three presidential candidates taped appeals for donations for a special star-studded episode of "American Idol" this month and all three were bumped by bigger stars (Reese Witherspoon, Miley Cyrus) and relegated to the next night.
19571	NYT_ENG_20080421.0149.LDC2009T13	The law of diminishing returns works the other way as well.
19572	NYT_ENG_20080421.0149.LDC2009T13	Satirical programs like "The Daily Show" send up politicians, but they increasingly invite politicians to send themselves up on their dime
19573	NYT_ENG_20080421.0149.LDC2009T13	too much collusion blunts the satire and turns even the most irreverent, iconoclastic television personalities into insiders.
19574	NYT_ENG_20080421.0149.LDC2009T13	This campaign year, more than any other, highlights the pecking order of television appearances -- the higher the politicians' stature or rank, the less they have to clown
19575	NYT_ENG_20080421.0149.LDC2009T13	the farther behind they are in the polls, the harder they have to sing for their supper.
19576	NYT_ENG_20080421.0149.LDC2009T13	Last week Clinton, Obama and Sen. John Edwards all appeared on the same episode of "The Colbert Report."
19577	NYT_ENG_20080421.0149.LDC2009T13	Edwards, who dropped out of the Democratic race in January, delivered a lengthy monologue mocking himself as a standard-bearer for the white male voter.
19578	NYT_ENG_20080421.0149.LDC2009T13	Clinton was assigned a less embarrassing task: She pretended to be the only person in the studio who could fix a broken television screen.
19579	NYT_ENG_20080421.0149.LDC2009T13	"Try toggling the input," she instructed an unseen engineer.
19580	NYT_ENG_20080421.0149.LDC2009T13	Obama, who is ahead of her in the delegate count, didn't have to mug
19581	NYT_ENG_20080421.0149.LDC2009T13	he only had to appear live by satellite from a campaign stop, and actually managed to work parts of his stump speech into the cameo.
19582	NYT_ENG_20080421.0149.LDC2009T13	Less is more, and more clout means less time on the air.
19583	NYT_ENG_20080421.0149.LDC2009T13	True power is being able to turn down Ellen DeGeneres or Jon Stewart.
19584	NYT_ENG_20080421.0149.LDC2009T13	But in the perennial campaign no politician is strong enough to just say no -- not even Nancy Reagan who in 1983 couldn't say no to "Diff'rent Strokes."

19587	NYT_ENG_20080425.0070.LDC2009T13	ATLANTA -- There's not a bit of bunting in sight.
19588	NYT_ENG_20080425.0070.LDC2009T13	No rope line to hold back the rabid throngs.
19589	NYT_ENG_20080425.0070.LDC2009T13	Secret Service protection?
19590	NYT_ENG_20080425.0070.LDC2009T13	More like one endlessly patient young woman who answers the phone and greets strangers walking through the door with cheery aplomb.
19591	NYT_ENG_20080425.0070.LDC2009T13	At first glance, this conservatively appointed office suite - muted carpeting, framed Ronald Reagan photo on the wall - in a highrise office building could be home to any of the countless well-connected doctors, lawyers or investment professionals who discretely keep Atlanta ticking.
19592	NYT_ENG_20080425.0070.LDC2009T13	Instead, it's the epicenter of a political earthquake.
19593	NYT_ENG_20080425.0070.LDC2009T13	Maybe.
19594	NYT_ENG_20080425.0070.LDC2009T13	"There are several things we want to get in place before we would make an announcement," Bob Barr says during a recent interview at his consulting firm, Liberty Strategies LLC in Atlanta.
19595	NYT_ENG_20080425.0070.LDC2009T13	"We anticipate having them nailed down in very short order."
19596	NYT_ENG_20080425.0070.LDC2009T13	As rhetorical stemwinders go, that's not quite up there with "Ask not what your country can do for you ? "
19597	NYT_ENG_20080425.0070.LDC2009T13	Still, it's tantalizingly, if incrementally, more detailed than what Barr, 59, had to say at the Heartland Libertarian Conference in Kansas City two weeks earlier.
19598	NYT_ENG_20080425.0070.LDC2009T13	There, the former Republican congressman from Georgia's 7th District declared he was forming an "exploratory committee" and would run for president as a Libertarian - if "sufficient numbers" of people were for it.
19599	NYT_ENG_20080425.0070.LDC2009T13	The tremors were felt immediately and everywhere.
19600	NYT_ENG_20080425.0070.LDC2009T13	While bloggers debated Barr's electability and Libertarian cred - he's been a party member since just 2006 - his "exploratory" Web site (www.bobbarr2008.com) showed about $25,000 in contributions within two days.
19601	NYT_ENG_20080425.0070.LDC2009T13	(By Friday morning, it was nearing $41,000.)
19602	NYT_ENG_20080425.0070.LDC2009T13	James Peniston of Duluth, Ga., was among the first donors.
19603	NYT_ENG_20080425.0070.LDC2009T13	"It's the beginning of my personal Boston Tea Party," Peniston, 62, said of his $100 donation.
19604	NYT_ENG_20080425.0070.LDC2009T13	"I'm fed up with the two-party system."
19605	NYT_ENG_20080425.0070.LDC2009T13	'Bless their hearts'
19606	NYT_ENG_20080425.0070.LDC2009T13	He's apparently not alone.
19607	NYT_ENG_20080425.0070.LDC2009T13	The exploratory committee polled likely voters and found that 7 percent said they would vote for unannounced candidate Barr.
19608	NYT_ENG_20080425.0070.LDC2009T13	Next up was a George Will column about Barr's potentially "ruinous" impact on presumed Republican nominee John McCain's chances.
19609	NYT_ENG_20080425.0070.LDC2009T13	So, has Barr heard anything - veiled threats, promises of plum ambassadorships - from the McCain forces lately?
19610	NYT_ENG_20080425.0070.LDC2009T13	"No, not directly," replies Barr, who had to give up his weekly op-ed column in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution when he launched the exploratory committee.
19611	NYT_ENG_20080425.0070.LDC2009T13	Of the few "more traditional" Republicans he has heard discouraging words from: "They have this sort of idea in their minds, bless their hearts, that nobody should do anything to upset the Republican nominee.
19612	NYT_ENG_20080425.0070.LDC2009T13	This notion that the political world swirls around two galaxies only, Republican and Democrat only, and anybody else who enters that fray is going to affect the other two and that's bad - that's a very myopic notion."
19613	NYT_ENG_20080425.0070.LDC2009T13	That's classic Barr, from the slightly withering "bless their hearts" to the almost reflexively Republican use of "Democrat" as an adjective.
19614	NYT_ENG_20080425.0070.LDC2009T13	(Also on the wall of the onetime House Manager: A framed display - including photos and gallery tickets - commemorating President Bill Clinton's impeachment trial.)
19615	NYT_ENG_20080425.0070.LDC2009T13	But he also sounds - and behaves - like a man with more than just a notion about running for president.
19616	NYT_ENG_20080425.0070.LDC2009T13	There's the impressive Web site that went live seemingly while Barr was still having a parking stub validated.
19617	NYT_ENG_20080425.0070.LDC2009T13	And the growing public appearance schedule that this week has taken him into Yankee territory and out of strictly Libertarian settings, like Thursday's speech at The College of New Jersey.
19618	NYT_ENG_20080425.0070.LDC2009T13	And the soundbite-ready argument - "Inside every American beats the heart of a Libertarian" - that he's the real change agent in a year of pretenders to the title.
19619	NYT_ENG_20080425.0070.LDC2009T13	Well, mostly pretenders.
19620	NYT_ENG_20080425.0070.LDC2009T13	Whether Barr's decision to go exploring now had anything to do with Ron Paul's presidential campaign all but officially ending last month, he credits the Texas congressman's upstart campaign with helping prepare the way.
19621	NYT_ENG_20080425.0070.LDC2009T13	"In my lifetime, we've not had an administration that has presented such a clear picture of why the current system is broken as the Bush administration, and that has changed the dynamics of the political system this year," Barr says.
19622	NYT_ENG_20080425.0070.LDC2009T13	"The 'Ron Paul phenomenon,' so to speak, also illustrates that there is a significant group of folks out there who recognize that the Libertarian party does present to them very relevant issues of freedom."
19623	NYT_ENG_20080425.0070.LDC2009T13	Ducks in a row?
19624	NYT_ENG_20080425.0070.LDC2009T13	What's not here - yet - are some of the more obvious outward trappings of a presidential run.
19625	NYT_ENG_20080425.0070.LDC2009T13	No "Straight Drawl Express" parked outside an Atlanta-based national campaign office, no paid full-time staff working inside.
19626	NYT_ENG_20080425.0070.LDC2009T13	Some experienced political hands have come on board recently as volunteers, but the staff and offices at Liberty Strategies LLC carry out much of the exploratory committee's work.
19627	NYT_ENG_20080425.0070.LDC2009T13	A lot of it is done by Derek Barr, 26, whose duties include quietly fact- checking his father's recall of his six grandchildren's ages during the interview.
19628	NYT_ENG_20080425.0070.LDC2009T13	On his reason for (possibly) running, however, no prompting is needed: "The size and scope and power of government," Barr says even before being asked, "I suspect will be the key to a Bob Barr campaign."
19629	NYT_ENG_20080425.0070.LDC2009T13	Meanwhile, much of his time recently has been spent, well, exploring.
19630	NYT_ENG_20080425.0070.LDC2009T13	With a dozen other candidates already announced (and six more considering running), can he actually secure the nomination at the Libertarian National Convention come Memorial Day weekend?
19631	NYT_ENG_20080425.0070.LDC2009T13	Who would work on his campaign?
19632	NYT_ENG_20080425.0070.LDC2009T13	What would happen to his consulting and legal clients (he's also "of counsel" to the law firm of Edwin Marger in Jasper, Ga.) for seven months?
19633	NYT_ENG_20080425.0070.LDC2009T13	How much could his previous hidebound conservative positions - he drafted the Defense of Marriage Act passed by Congress in 1996 and was an outspoken supporter of the war on drugs - come back to haunt him with some Libertarians?
19634	NYT_ENG_20080425.0070.LDC2009T13	And what price a presidential run in the YouTube Age?
19635	NYT_ENG_20080425.0070.LDC2009T13	"Certainly what little sphere of privacy we've been able to recapture over the last couple of years will dissipate immediately," said Barr, whose wife, Jeri, is chief executive officer of the nonprofit Center for Family Resources in North Metro-Atlanta.
19636	NYT_ENG_20080425.0070.LDC2009T13	"Running for president is not something you do lightly or precipitously."
19637	NYT_ENG_20080425.0070.LDC2009T13	Or without having all your ducks in a row first.
19638	NYT_ENG_20080425.0070.LDC2009T13	Even if those ducks might never, er, hatch.
19639	NYT_ENG_20080425.0070.LDC2009T13	Preparing for battle
19640	NYT_ENG_20080425.0070.LDC2009T13	Russell Verney, a volunteer adviser who'd be Barr's campaign manager, recalled the night in 1992 when maverick Texas billionaire Ross Perot went on "Larry King Live" and blurted out his intention to run as an independent presidential candidate.
19641	NYT_ENG_20080425.0070.LDC2009T13	Within two hours, 10,000 phone calls overwhelmed the switchboard of Perot's computer firm.
19642	NYT_ENG_20080425.0070.LDC2009T13	"From then on, it was playing catch-up," said Verney, who worked on that campaign and managed Perot's 1996 run.
19643	NYT_ENG_20080425.0070.LDC2009T13	"It was always a campaign that was overwhelmed."
19644	NYT_ENG_20080425.0070.LDC2009T13	So while Barr continues to mull his options privately and publicly - Wednesday's "Barr Blog" entry hinted ominously at "tactics and strategies" that might be used against him, then invoked Bob Marley as a model courageous figure - others prepare for battle.
19645	NYT_ENG_20080425.0070.LDC2009T13	Verney is already pondering how many staff, volunteer coordinators and offices the campaign would need on Day One.
19646	NYT_ENG_20080425.0070.LDC2009T13	Audrey Mullen of political PR firm Advocacy Ink helps set up Barr's media appearances and collects footage for a commercial that would be ready to run after a formal announcement.
19647	NYT_ENG_20080425.0070.LDC2009T13	For early donor Peniston, that announcement can't come soon enough.
19648	NYT_ENG_20080425.0070.LDC2009T13	Or, apparently, without an endless supply of bunting.
19649	NYT_ENG_20080425.0070.LDC2009T13	"I hope he does run, if only to really shake things up," said Peniston, a self-described independent who leans Republican.
19650	NYT_ENG_20080425.0070.LDC2009T13	"Unfortunately, third parties don't get involved in this till it's nearly too late.
19651	NYT_ENG_20080425.0070.LDC2009T13	So if he's running, he's got to keep running for the next four years."

19654	NYT_ENG_20080503.0119.LDC2009T13	HAWKS SEE AN OPENING, THE CELTICS A LIFELINE
19655	NYT_ENG_20080503.0119.LDC2009T13	ATLANTA
19656	NYT_ENG_20080503.0119.LDC2009T13	For five years, ever since a rebuilding project started with General Manager Billy Knight in 2003, Atlanta Hawks fans have resented failed draft picks (Shelden Williams), the refusal to draft a top-shelf point guard (Chris Paul, Deron Williams), the signing of the swingman Joe Johnson to a five-year, $70 million contract, and the squabbling over finances by a cadre of 10 owners.
19657	NYT_ENG_20080503.0119.LDC2009T13	So when the Hawks were thumped in the first two games of a best- of-seven Eastern Conference series by the Boston Celtics, a collapse of the Hawks' rebuilding project did not seem far away.
19658	NYT_ENG_20080503.0119.LDC2009T13	Mike Woodson, the coach, was already in jeopardy of losing his job.
19659	NYT_ENG_20080503.0119.LDC2009T13	Given the ease with which the Celtics sliced up the Hawks, it seemed very likely that the roster would be examined closely.
19660	NYT_ENG_20080503.0119.LDC2009T13	But the Hawks have had the last word against the doomsayers.
19661	NYT_ENG_20080503.0119.LDC2009T13	Atlanta suddenly looks like a promising franchise because it has taken the Celtics, who had the NBA's best record this season, to Game 7 on Sunday in Boston.
19662	NYT_ENG_20080503.0119.LDC2009T13	"When you make the playoffs, you are not guaranteed to play in it the next year and the year after, so when you get an opportunity to play in it, you better try to make the best of it," Woodson said.
19663	NYT_ENG_20080503.0119.LDC2009T13	The Hawks gathered around Woodson after a one-hour walk-through here Saturday afternoon.
19664	NYT_ENG_20080503.0119.LDC2009T13	He sounded delighted with his upstart team, the third youngest in the league.
19665	NYT_ENG_20080503.0119.LDC2009T13	"You have made it a one-game series," Woodson told his players.
19666	NYT_ENG_20080503.0119.LDC2009T13	"You have a chance to do something special."
19667	NYT_ENG_20080503.0119.LDC2009T13	The Celtics are trying to avoid the embarrassment of becoming the fourth No. 1 seed to lose to a No. 8 seed in the playoffs.
19668	NYT_ENG_20080503.0119.LDC2009T13	They were 66-16 in the regular season, but they have seemed old in several games against the Hawks.
19669	NYT_ENG_20080503.0119.LDC2009T13	Johnson, who has emerged as an All-Star, said he watched the Celtics bending over, clutching their shorts, in the fourth quarter of the Hawks' 103-100 victory Friday night at Philips Arena.
19670	NYT_ENG_20080503.0119.LDC2009T13	Johnson said that Kevin Garnett and Kendrick Perkins, in particular, seemed tired, especially on pick and rolls.
19671	NYT_ENG_20080503.0119.LDC2009T13	"They weren't coming as fast," Johnson said.
19672	NYT_ENG_20080503.0119.LDC2009T13	"Sometimes, they weren't coming at all."
19673	NYT_ENG_20080503.0119.LDC2009T13	The Celtics have won all three games of the series that have been played at TD Banknorth Garden.
19674	NYT_ENG_20080503.0119.LDC2009T13	The victories have been convincing, by an average of 22 points.
19675	NYT_ENG_20080503.0119.LDC2009T13	The Celtics seem to play with more energy at home, and the Hawks have not figured out how to combat Boston's pressure when the Celtics are playing on their own court.
19676	NYT_ENG_20080503.0119.LDC2009T13	"We feel good at home all the time," said Doc Rivers, Boston's coach.
19677	NYT_ENG_20080503.0119.LDC2009T13	"That's why we fought all year to get home-court advantage.
19678	NYT_ENG_20080503.0119.LDC2009T13	As I said after Game 5, we can't just hang our hat on being at home."
19679	NYT_ENG_20080503.0119.LDC2009T13	Atlanta is shooting 47.6 percent from the field at Philips Arena, but only 39 percent in Boston.
19680	NYT_ENG_20080503.0119.LDC2009T13	The Hawks have turned the ball over 94 times, compared with only 66 turnovers for the Celtics.
19681	NYT_ENG_20080503.0119.LDC2009T13	The health of the 6-foot-9 forward Marvin Williams, who has been assigned to guard the Celtics' Paul Pierce, may be a more- pressing issue for the Hawks.
19682	NYT_ENG_20080503.0119.LDC2009T13	Williams sprained his left knee in the second half of Game 6 on Friday night.
19683	NYT_ENG_20080503.0119.LDC2009T13	He limped through Saturday's walk-through with the knee heavily bandaged, and the Hawks listed him as doubtful for Sunday's game, although Woodson said, "My gut says he'll play."
19684	NYT_ENG_20080503.0119.LDC2009T13	The Hawks have been able to win because players other than Johnson -- Williams, for example -- have established themselves in the series.
19685	NYT_ENG_20080503.0119.LDC2009T13	Johnson, who scored 35 points in Atlanta's Game 4 win, had only 7 points through three quarters in Game 6 because of the Celtics' relentless double teams.
19686	NYT_ENG_20080503.0119.LDC2009T13	The Hawks responded by sharing the scoring responsibilities, and six players finished in double figures.
19687	NYT_ENG_20080503.0119.LDC2009T13	When the Hawks tried to spread the floor to eliminate the double teams, the Celtics rushed two players at Johnson at halfcourt, only to have him relieve the pressure by passing to Al Horford at the top of the key.
19688	NYT_ENG_20080503.0119.LDC2009T13	Horford then turned to the basket with a three-on-two advantage.
19689	NYT_ENG_20080503.0119.LDC2009T13	The Hawks routinely attacked the basket and went to the free-throw line 15 times in the fourth quarter
19690	NYT_ENG_20080503.0119.LDC2009T13	the Celtics shot only two free throws in the period.
19691	NYT_ENG_20080503.0119.LDC2009T13	The Celtics want to regroup and show the same strong defense they displayed during the regular season.
19692	NYT_ENG_20080503.0119.LDC2009T13	Boston gave up 90.29 points a game
19693	NYT_ENG_20080503.0119.LDC2009T13	only Detroit had a better average.
19694	NYT_ENG_20080503.0119.LDC2009T13	"It's either win or go home," Celtics guard Rajon Rondo said.
19695	NYT_ENG_20080503.0119.LDC2009T13	"We've just got to go out there and get the job done."
19696	NYT_ENG_20080506.0226.LDC2009T13	EVACUATION ORDERED AS CHILEAN VOLCANO BEGINS TO SPEW ASH
19697	NYT_ENG_20080506.0226.LDC2009T13	SANTIAGO, Chile
19698	NYT_ENG_20080506.0226.LDC2009T13	The Chaiten volcano in southern Chile blasted ash and what appeared to be lava a dozen miles into the air on Tuesday, leading the government to order the immediate and complete evacuation of everyone living within a 30-mile radius of it.
19699	NYT_ENG_20080506.0226.LDC2009T13	Preceded by dozens of tremors, the volcano -- until now considered inactive -- began erupting last Friday.
19700	NYT_ENG_20080506.0226.LDC2009T13	It covered about 60 square miles with more than 15 inches of ash, rendering the air unbreathable, contaminating water sources, killing livestock and destroying all small- and medium-scale agriculture in this rural and mostly impoverished area 800 miles south of the capital, Santiago.
19701	NYT_ENG_20080506.0226.LDC2009T13	An enormous gray mushroom cloud of ash that could be seen from 100 miles away has since loomed over this sliver of land next to Argentina, where continental Chile breaks up into archipelagos.
19702	NYT_ENG_20080506.0226.LDC2009T13	East winds have spread ash toward Argentina.
19703	NYT_ENG_20080506.0226.LDC2009T13	The thick layer of volcanic ash, coupled with rain, has made access to the sparsely populated border zone difficult.
19704	NYT_ENG_20080506.0226.LDC2009T13	President Michelle Bachelet visited the area on Monday, announcing subsidies and other aid for affected families.
19705	NYT_ENG_20080506.0226.LDC2009T13	On Tuesday, she convened an emergency committee of government ministers, emergency agency representatives, the director of the police force and regional officials.
19706	NYT_ENG_20080506.0226.LDC2009T13	The committee resolved to order the total evacuation of Chaiten, to authorize the release of emergency funds and to appoint Defense Minister Jose Goni to coordinate the response to the natural disaster.
19707	NYT_ENG_20080506.0226.LDC2009T13	"The situation is rather complicated," said Interior Minister Edmundo Perez.
19708	NYT_ENG_20080506.0226.LDC2009T13	"The volcano continues erupting, and we don't know how long this will last.
19709	NYT_ENG_20080506.0226.LDC2009T13	It could be a day, a week or more."
19710	NYT_ENG_20080506.0226.LDC2009T13	About 8,000 residents of nearby towns have been evacuated since the weekend.
19711	NYT_ENG_20080506.0226.LDC2009T13	There have been no deaths or injuries reported, although a 92-year-old woman died of a heart attack as she was evacuated from Chaiten on Sunday.
19712	NYT_ENG_20080506.0226.LDC2009T13	After flying over the area on Tuesday morning, specialists from the National Geology and Mining Service said that they had found no evidence of lava flowing from the volcano, although they were able to see lava at the base of the large crater.
19713	NYT_ENG_20080506.0226.LDC2009T13	This is the first time the Chaiten volcano has erupted in at least 2,000 years, according to service officials.
19714	NYT_ENG_20080506.0226.LDC2009T13	Since the weekend, the military, navy and police have helped ship out several thousand residents from Chaiten, situated only six miles away from the base of the volcano and near the Chaiten Bay.
19715	NYT_ENG_20080506.0226.LDC2009T13	About 20 families are still refusing to leave their homes, animals and belongings in spite of the presidential order, which makes no exceptions for military, police or journalists.
19716	NYT_ENG_20080506.0226.LDC2009T13	On Tuesday, hundreds of residents in Futaleufu, just miles from the border, were being evacuated voluntarily by bus, crossing over to Argentina for part of the journey.
19717	NYT_ENG_20080506.0226.LDC2009T13	About 25,000 head of cattle and sheep are at imminent risk of dying, eating plants and drinking water contaminated by volcanic ash.
19718	NYT_ENG_20080506.0226.LDC2009T13	The navy has shipped feed, and some animals have also been evacuated to uncontaminated areas.
19719	NYT_ENG_20080506.0226.LDC2009T13	Some civil engineers said they believed that the soil and plant life in the area may not recover for several decades, if at all.
19720	NYT_ENG_20080506.0226.LDC2009T13	"The soil in the area covered by this volume of ash deposits will be practically lost," said Wilfredo Vera, engineer from the University of Chile.
19721	NYT_ENG_20080506.0226.LDC2009T13	He told a Chilean radio station that "agricultural production will be virtually nil."

19724	NYT_ENG_20080515.0125.LDC2009T13	Without horses, where would we be?
19725	NYT_ENG_20080515.0125.LDC2009T13	Trousers might never have become fashionable.
19726	NYT_ENG_20080515.0125.LDC2009T13	The violin might never have come into existence.
19727	NYT_ENG_20080515.0125.LDC2009T13	The Aztecs might have thrived another few centuries.
19728	NYT_ENG_20080515.0125.LDC2009T13	The Industrial Revolution might have sputtered out before its time.
19729	NYT_ENG_20080515.0125.LDC2009T13	No one would have to get off his high horse, and no political race would have a dark horse candidate.
19730	NYT_ENG_20080515.0125.LDC2009T13	And the American Museum of Natural History would have had to find another subject for its sprawling, charming and illuminating exhibition that is opening Saturday: "The Horse."
19731	NYT_ENG_20080515.0125.LDC2009T13	The opening festivities will include demonstrations of horseshoeing and horse grooming
19732	NYT_ENG_20080515.0125.LDC2009T13	an appearance by Thumbelina, a creature billed as the world's smallest horse (171/2 inches tall)
19733	NYT_ENG_20080515.0125.LDC2009T13	and a visit by a vintage horse-drawn ambulance.
19734	NYT_ENG_20080515.0125.LDC2009T13	But the exhibition itself relies far less on country fair spectacle and far more on a provocative history of the ways in which humans and horses became, as the show says, "powerfully linked."
19735	NYT_ENG_20080515.0125.LDC2009T13	Those links may be as slight as fashions in clothing (trousers, we are told, developed specifically for the riding of horses) and as important as the fate of empires ("Next to God," Cortes is supposed to have said about the conquest of Mexico, "we owed our victory to the horses").
19736	NYT_ENG_20080515.0125.LDC2009T13	The exhibition is suggestive about the evolution of the arts.
19737	NYT_ENG_20080515.0125.LDC2009T13	(The 13th- and 14th-century Mongols, who held their immense empire together with the aid of the horse, also used hair from its tail to create the ancestor of the modern violin bow.)
19738	NYT_ENG_20080515.0125.LDC2009T13	And it invites speculation about the course of technology.
19739	NYT_ENG_20080515.0125.LDC2009T13	(The Industrial Revolution ultimately displaced horse power with horsepower, but not before horses shared the burden with machines: on display is a horse-drawn, steam-powered firetruck from 19th-century Pennsylvania.)
19740	NYT_ENG_20080515.0125.LDC2009T13	Created by Ross MacPhee, the curator of mammalogy in the Division of Vertebrate Zoology at the museum, and Sandra Olsen, the curator of anthropology at the Carnegie Museum of Natural History in Pittsburgh, this show makes it clear just how crucial a role the horse has played.
19741	NYT_ENG_20080515.0125.LDC2009T13	With the aid of dioramas, interviews, marvelous computer graphics, varied skeletons, archaeological finds, reproductions of cave paintings and objects, including a World War I gas mask for a horse and Triple Crown trophies, the history of the horse becomes humanized.
19742	NYT_ENG_20080515.0125.LDC2009T13	The ancient Greeks, the show points out, might have been so surprised by their first sight of warriors on horseback that they imagined that they were centaurs.
19743	NYT_ENG_20080515.0125.LDC2009T13	The exhibition almost seems to suggest that this mythology touches on a deeper truth: The connection is so strong, we are all of us centaurs.
19744	NYT_ENG_20080515.0125.LDC2009T13	At one time the relationship could hardly have been ignored.
19745	NYT_ENG_20080515.0125.LDC2009T13	Horses, the show reminds us, "have cleared forests, plowed land, herded cattle and driven machines."
19746	NYT_ENG_20080515.0125.LDC2009T13	From the moment they were first used to pull chariots into battle (perhaps 1500 B.C.) until their valedictory cavalry campaigns in the World War II, horses were bound up in human warfare.
19747	NYT_ENG_20080515.0125.LDC2009T13	Similarly, with human welfare: in 1900 130,000 horses were working in Manhattan alone (and their presence must have been palpable: each horse, the show says, produced up to 45 pounds of manure and 2 gallons of urine every day).
19748	NYT_ENG_20080515.0125.LDC2009T13	Now we are mainly aware of horses through the remnants of horse- inspired vocabulary, by the persistence of sports like polo, and, as a video shows, from ceremonies from around the world that use the horse to display power and grace.
19749	NYT_ENG_20080515.0125.LDC2009T13	But the show reminds us just how recent a phenomenon this diminution of importance is, and how difficult it is to think of any human activity untouched by the powers of the horse.
19750	NYT_ENG_20080515.0125.LDC2009T13	But the horse, of course, is equally unthinkable without the human, which the exhibition also points out, but humans don't enter the story for a while.
19751	NYT_ENG_20080515.0125.LDC2009T13	The opening diorama shows ancient horses of North America, some 50 million years ago: a three-toed Hypohippus feeds on forest shrubs as a large, modern-looking Dinohippus grazes in the grasses.
19752	NYT_ENG_20080515.0125.LDC2009T13	A large number of horse species were "forest browsers" with three toes.
19753	NYT_ENG_20080515.0125.LDC2009T13	But with the changes in climate about 35 million years ago, the predecessor of the modern horse became dominant, his two outer toes yielding to the single hoof, suited to the harder grasslands.
19754	NYT_ENG_20080515.0125.LDC2009T13	In outlining the evolution of the horse, the exhibition also traces the animals' mass migrations, which are almost the inverse of human pathways.
19755	NYT_ENG_20080515.0125.LDC2009T13	Instead of beginning in Africa and migrating to Europe, Asia and finally to the Americas, like mankind's ancestors, horses took just the opposite path: the majority of horse species began in the Americas.
19756	NYT_ENG_20080515.0125.LDC2009T13	Some 20 million years ago, three-toed horses crossed into Asia and then into Europe and Africa.
19757	NYT_ENG_20080515.0125.LDC2009T13	About 10,000 years ago, horses became extinct in the Americas -- perhaps because of environmental change and overhunting -- which is one reason they had such a forceful impact when the Spanish took them back to the Americas, in conquest.
19758	NYT_ENG_20080515.0125.LDC2009T13	That expansive family tree was pruned over time and not, it seems, by human forces.
19759	NYT_ENG_20080515.0125.LDC2009T13	The show argues that all contemporary horses -- perhaps even the Asiatic wild horse, the Przewalski -- are part of a single species, Equus caballus.
19760	NYT_ENG_20080515.0125.LDC2009T13	Even the genus Equus is small, containing only seven living species, including donkeys and zebras.
19761	NYT_ENG_20080515.0125.LDC2009T13	The impact of the horse, though, is apparent in the earliest surviving human evidence.
19762	NYT_ENG_20080515.0125.LDC2009T13	The show reproduces some of the extraordinary cave paintings of Southern Europe, which are perhaps 16,000 years old.
19763	NYT_ENG_20080515.0125.LDC2009T13	One, in Lascaux Cave, shows a horse looking exactly like the Przewalski wild horse of Central Asia, with its pale stomach and dark mane.
19764	NYT_ENG_20080515.0125.LDC2009T13	Recent archaeological research in northern Kazakhstan, displayed in a diorama, suggests that the Botai people of Central Asia were among the first to domesticate horses.
19765	NYT_ENG_20080515.0125.LDC2009T13	Digs have yielded evidence of ancient fences, along with soil components suggesting a high concentration of manure.
19766	NYT_ENG_20080515.0125.LDC2009T13	In domestication, horses were remade into human companions and human tools, but physiologically they didn't change much-- something that, as the exhibition notes, cannot be said of the boar when it was transformed into a domesticated pig, or the wolf into a domesticated dog.
19767	NYT_ENG_20080515.0125.LDC2009T13	Horses were also "good partners": herd animals that could also show intense loyalties.
19768	NYT_ENG_20080515.0125.LDC2009T13	They were easily trained and relatively free from the territorial viciousness of related species, like zebras.
19769	NYT_ENG_20080515.0125.LDC2009T13	Human planning split this single species into numerous branches and more than 200 breeds.
19770	NYT_ENG_20080515.0125.LDC2009T13	One ambition was to increase the animal's size, so it could become a more imposing war-beast, strong enough to bear its own 50 pounds of armor along with the hundreds of pounds of a mounted warrior.
19771	NYT_ENG_20080515.0125.LDC2009T13	So important was the size of warrior horses that in the 16th century, King Henry VIII, coveting the larger animals on the continent, decreed that all landowners must keep at least two large mares.
19772	NYT_ENG_20080515.0125.LDC2009T13	Among the gentry of Europe, the domestication of the horse, and the formal display of ownership and mastery, also came to reflect personal cultivation and accomplishment.
19773	NYT_ENG_20080515.0125.LDC2009T13	The French, Spanish and English words for gentleman, the show points out -- chevalier, caballero and cavalier -- also mean horseman.
19774	NYT_ENG_20080515.0125.LDC2009T13	Some parts of this show are too brief -- the transformation of the American West could have been more imaginatively presented -- and some parts are less than revelatory: the presence of horses in sports is familiar.
19775	NYT_ENG_20080515.0125.LDC2009T13	The show might also have provided more extensive glimpses of the horse in the arts: in Remington's famous 19th-century images, in plays like "Equus," in Hollywood westerns or even in vintage television comedies like "Mister Ed."
19776	NYT_ENG_20080515.0125.LDC2009T13	Horses have generally been imagined not as alien beings, but as reflections of ourselves.
19777	NYT_ENG_20080515.0125.LDC2009T13	They are almost never demonic
19778	NYT_ENG_20080515.0125.LDC2009T13	they seem to represent the best of humanity's animal nature.
19779	NYT_ENG_20080515.0125.LDC2009T13	Despite weaknesses, though, the show's impact is strong.
19780	NYT_ENG_20080515.0125.LDC2009T13	And could interaction between humans and any other animal bear this sort of examination?
19781	NYT_ENG_20080515.0125.LDC2009T13	Dogs may inspire more intense and complex friendships, but horses were almost more than companions
19782	NYT_ENG_20080515.0125.LDC2009T13	they were partners in agriculture, war, industry and commerce.
19783	NYT_ENG_20080515.0125.LDC2009T13	The final gallery contains a remarkable life-size sculpture of a horse, "Isbelle," by Deborah Butterfield.
19784	NYT_ENG_20080515.0125.LDC2009T13	It seems constructed out of scraps of driftwood, but is actually cast bronze, its weathered skeleton looking worn and ancient.
19785	NYT_ENG_20080515.0125.LDC2009T13	It seems old, haphazardly shaped with its random relics and remnants, but the creature is so tautly formed, its skeletal innards seem charged with dynamism and power.
19786	NYT_ENG_20080515.0125.LDC2009T13	It's not a bad image for this presentation of the horse's history: it might seem a collection of ancient and random facts, but when brought together as smartly as it is, it almost comes to life, reminding us of the centaurs we all once were.

19800	NYT_ENG_20080520.0062.LDC2009T13	MOVING UGGLA FROM NO. 2 IN LINEUP PAYING POWERFUL DIVIDENDS
19801	NYT_ENG_20080520.0062.LDC2009T13	Cox News Service
19802	NYT_ENG_20080520.0062.LDC2009T13	MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. - Smartest lineup move the Marlins made this year?
19803	NYT_ENG_20080520.0062.LDC2009T13	Switching second baseman Dan Uggla from second in the batting order to a place where he can worry less about getting on base and swing away.
19804	NYT_ENG_20080520.0062.LDC2009T13	After he moved out of the second spot May 2 - he currently is batting fifth - Uggla hit .439 with eight home runs and 17 RBI in his next 12 games.
19805	NYT_ENG_20080520.0062.LDC2009T13	Uggla led the first-place Marlins in batting average (.316), home runs (13) and RBI (31) as they began a three-game series with his former club, the Arizona Diamondbacks, Tuesday at Dolphin Stadium.
19806	NYT_ENG_20080520.0062.LDC2009T13	He also leads in strikeouts (44), less than ideal for the No. 2 spot, with its greater emphasis on setting the table rather than clearing it.
19807	NYT_ENG_20080520.0062.LDC2009T13	"Up until this year, I wouldn't have believed it made any difference," Uggla's father, John, said from home in Columbia, Tenn. "He's always hit second.
19808	NYT_ENG_20080520.0062.LDC2009T13	He gets more at-bats that way.
19809	NYT_ENG_20080520.0062.LDC2009T13	Last year they dropped him down for a few games and he didn't do that well.
19810	NYT_ENG_20080520.0062.LDC2009T13	But now, wow.
19811	NYT_ENG_20080520.0062.LDC2009T13	The whole thing is kind of amazing to me his power numbers are so good."
19812	NYT_ENG_20080520.0062.LDC2009T13	Dan Uggla himself isn't sold on the idea that batting order matters that much - he points out he still hit 31 homers last year.
19813	NYT_ENG_20080520.0062.LDC2009T13	"It hasn't changed my approach at all," Uggla said.
19814	NYT_ENG_20080520.0062.LDC2009T13	"The only thing it has done for me is it's given me more RBI opportunities, hitting behind (Jeremy) Hermida, Hanley (Ramirez) and those guys.
19815	NYT_ENG_20080520.0062.LDC2009T13	There's a good chance those guys are going to be on base by the time I get up there."
19816	NYT_ENG_20080520.0062.LDC2009T13	But the statistics suggest moving him down was the right thing.
19817	NYT_ENG_20080520.0062.LDC2009T13	His batting average has climbed from a lackluster .245 last season.
19818	NYT_ENG_20080520.0062.LDC2009T13	He is waiting for pitches he can punish and the team is benefiting more when he does connect.
19819	NYT_ENG_20080520.0062.LDC2009T13	"I don't know if it's the lineup change, but he's been swinging it pretty good," manager Fredi Gonzales said.
19820	NYT_ENG_20080520.0062.LDC2009T13	It's a wiser handling of a rarity at his position, a power guy at second base.
19821	NYT_ENG_20080520.0062.LDC2009T13	Uggla is on pace to become the first second baseman to pound 80 or more extra-base hits in consecutive seasons since Hall of Famer Rogers Hornsby in the 1920s.
19822	NYT_ENG_20080520.0062.LDC2009T13	Uggla, 28, has a higher slugging and on-base percentage than Jeff Kent did at the same age, and Kent has been one of the archetypal big-stick second baseman.
19823	NYT_ENG_20080520.0062.LDC2009T13	This year, Uggla ranks in the top two with Chase Utley in a slew of offensive power categories among all second basemen.
19824	NYT_ENG_20080520.0062.LDC2009T13	The Diamondbacks didn't see that coming when they failed to protect him on their roster in 2005.
19825	NYT_ENG_20080520.0062.LDC2009T13	Facing his former team is just a chance to see old friends, Uggla insists, downplaying the idea he has any extra incentive to play well.
19826	NYT_ENG_20080520.0062.LDC2009T13	At the same time, there's an occasional hint he has not entirely forgotten the history when the topic turns to his fielding.
19827	NYT_ENG_20080520.0062.LDC2009T13	"Shoot, I only made 11 errors last year," Uggla said.
19828	NYT_ENG_20080520.0062.LDC2009T13	"I don't think that's really considered a liability.
19829	NYT_ENG_20080520.0062.LDC2009T13	That was supposed to be my downfall, why the D'backs never really gave me a chance because I couldn't play defense."
19830	NYT_ENG_20080520.0062.LDC2009T13	Actually, Uggla is right that he doesn't have much left to prove to the Diamondbacks.
19831	NYT_ENG_20080520.0062.LDC2009T13	The team that matters now is the Marlins.
19832	NYT_ENG_20080520.0062.LDC2009T13	The Marlins, who announced a long-term, $70 million deal with shortstop Hanley Ramirez during the weekend, have signaled no immediate plans to lock up other players.
19833	NYT_ENG_20080520.0062.LDC2009T13	President of Baseball Operations Larry Beinfest made no other recommendations for multiyear deals, team owner Jeffrey Loria said.
19834	NYT_ENG_20080520.0062.LDC2009T13	Uggla is eligible for arbitration next year.
19835	NYT_ENG_20080520.0062.LDC2009T13	His fielding (five errors this season, tied for fifth-most at his position), his age (four years older than Ramirez) and other factors all play into the calculations.
19836	NYT_ENG_20080520.0062.LDC2009T13	The team will eventually have to decide whether to offer him a multiyear deal or just go year to year until he's eligible for free agency in a little more than three years.
19837	NYT_ENG_20080520.0062.LDC2009T13	Certainly he's a bargain now at $417,000.
19838	NYT_ENG_20080520.0062.LDC2009T13	The Marlins briefly considered moving Uggla to third base when they traded Miguel Cabrera.
19839	NYT_ENG_20080520.0062.LDC2009T13	The franchise has infield prospect Chris Coghlan waiting in the wings.
19840	NYT_ENG_20080520.0062.LDC2009T13	The long-term outlook depends in part on the chemistry up the middle with Ramirez.
19841	NYT_ENG_20080520.0062.LDC2009T13	That chemistry can't always be measured in the score book.
19842	NYT_ENG_20080520.0062.LDC2009T13	Uggla admitted a "bonehead play" in the opener of the team's most recent series, failing to cover second on what should have been a double play.
19843	NYT_ENG_20080520.0062.LDC2009T13	Instead, it led to two unearned runs by Kansas City after a double-clutching Ramirez botched a throw to first.
19844	NYT_ENG_20080520.0062.LDC2009T13	At other moments, the double-play tandem has worked more smoothly.
19845	NYT_ENG_20080520.0062.LDC2009T13	"As far as them offering any kind of long-term deal, that's totally their call," Uggla said.
19846	NYT_ENG_20080520.0062.LDC2009T13	"If they want to do it, great.
19847	NYT_ENG_20080520.0062.LDC2009T13	Obviously I love it down here.
19848	NYT_ENG_20080520.0062.LDC2009T13	I love the guys.
19849	NYT_ENG_20080520.0062.LDC2009T13	We'll just have to wait to see what happens.
19850	NYT_ENG_20080520.0062.LDC2009T13	It's too early to tell right now."
19851	NYT_ENG_20080520.0062.LDC2009T13	It is not too early to see one thing - moving Uggla down in the batting order has helped the Marlins move up.
19852	NYT_ENG_20080520.0062.LDC2009T13	And if he can keep it up, he will make a powerful case that the Marlins should not let him move on.

19855	NYT_ENG_20080709.0149.LDC2009T13	No Challenger?
19856	NYT_ENG_20080709.0149.LDC2009T13	No Problem Hot SRT8 muscle car is still available at some dealerships By Eric Morath The Detroit News The 2008 Dodge Challenger SRT8 is not sold out after all.
19857	NYT_ENG_20080709.0149.LDC2009T13	The retro-looking muscle car can still be found through some Chrysler LLC dealers, including one in northern Macomb County that has 19 Challengers for sale.
19858	NYT_ENG_20080709.0149.LDC2009T13	That's a surprising number considering the automaker has said the entire production run of the vehicle was sold even before the first ones rolled off the assembly line in May.
19859	NYT_ENG_20080709.0149.LDC2009T13	In truth, customer names were attached to the vast majority of the 6,400 limited-edition Challengers as they were built in Brampton, Ont., said Curtrise Garner, a Chrysler spokeswoman.
19860	NYT_ENG_20080709.0149.LDC2009T13	But a quarter of the cars were set aside for dealer orders.
19861	NYT_ENG_20080709.0149.LDC2009T13	While only two hard-to-find Challengers were in the lot at Dick Huvaere's Richmond Chrysler Jeep Dodge on Wednesday, more are expected.
19862	NYT_ENG_20080709.0149.LDC2009T13	The dealership didn't take any customer pre-orders.
19863	NYT_ENG_20080709.0149.LDC2009T13	General Manager Jim Simpson is hoping to create a little excitement by stocking his lot with the Hemi Orange, Silver Metallic and Brilliant Black Challengers.
19864	NYT_ENG_20080709.0149.LDC2009T13	An ad in The Macomb Daily this week touted that the dealership had nine black, eight orange and two silver Hemi-powered coupes available for sale.
19865	NYT_ENG_20080709.0149.LDC2009T13	"People just love these cars," Simpson said.
19866	NYT_ENG_20080709.0149.LDC2009T13	"I wish I had 50 of them."
19867	NYT_ENG_20080709.0149.LDC2009T13	So far, Simpson has sold just one, even after inviting about 20 interested customers to view the first Challenger to arrive.
19868	NYT_ENG_20080709.0149.LDC2009T13	Along with the two on the lot now, four should arrive within days, and the remainder delivered later this month.
19869	NYT_ENG_20080709.0149.LDC2009T13	Despite several inquiries from customers, Simpson did not take preorders.
19870	NYT_ENG_20080709.0149.LDC2009T13	In the past, as was the case with the Dodge Viper, preorders resulted in constant calls from anxious fans and cancellations when customers decided the vehicles weren't what they expected or cost more than they could afford.
19871	NYT_ENG_20080709.0149.LDC2009T13	The dealer is hoping to score a premium price on the rebirth of the 1970s classic.
19872	NYT_ENG_20080709.0149.LDC2009T13	On its Web site, Huvaere priced the Challenger at $45,145, plus applicable taxes -- about $7,000 more than the manufacturer's suggested retail price set late last year.
19873	NYT_ENG_20080709.0149.LDC2009T13	As independent businesses, dealers may charge more than the suggested price.
19874	NYT_ENG_20080709.0149.LDC2009T13	"We're negotiating each price with the individual customer," Simpson said.
19875	NYT_ENG_20080709.0149.LDC2009T13	"We're not getting a huge amount over sticker."
19876	NYT_ENG_20080709.0149.LDC2009T13	In other parts of the country, Challengers are nearly impossible to find.
19877	NYT_ENG_20080709.0149.LDC2009T13	"There's not a dealer up and down the coast here that has a Challenger," said Jon Meyers, owner of Naples Dodge in Naples, Fla.
19878	NYT_ENG_20080709.0149.LDC2009T13	He took pre-orders for just three days and sold all eight Challengers he was allotted before they hit his lot.
19879	NYT_ENG_20080709.0149.LDC2009T13	Van Dyke Dodge in Warren has two Challengers left.
19880	NYT_ENG_20080709.0149.LDC2009T13	Owner Carl Galeana said he pre-sold 16 Challengers and ordered five more to be used as demo cars, as vehicles for politicians to ride in Fourth of July parades, and to draw attention to his store.
19881	NYT_ENG_20080709.0149.LDC2009T13	"I have just a couple left," he said "And I might need to buy one for myself."

19883	NYT_ENG_20080713.0144.LDC2009T13	GESTURES, IF NOT PROGRESS, AT UNION MEETING
19884	NYT_ENG_20080713.0144.LDC2009T13	PARIS
19885	NYT_ENG_20080713.0144.LDC2009T13	Leaders of 43 nations with nearly 800 million inhabitants inaugurated a new "Union for the Mediterranean" on Sunday, meant to bring the northern and southern countries that ring the sea closer together through practical projects dealing with the environment, climate, transport, immigration and policing.
19886	NYT_ENG_20080713.0144.LDC2009T13	The meeting was also an opportunity for President Nicolas Sarkozy of France to exercise some highly public Middle East diplomacy by bringing President Bashar al-Assad of Syria out of isolation and by playing host to a session between Prime Minister Ehud Olmert of Israel and the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas.
19887	NYT_ENG_20080713.0144.LDC2009T13	The Union for the Mediterranean is Sarkozy's brainchild, but his original conception was watered down to include all members of the European Union, not just those along the Mediterranean coast.
19888	NYT_ENG_20080713.0144.LDC2009T13	The enlargement made it easier for Sarkozy to include Syria and Israel, that remain in a formal state of war with one another, and others, like Jordan, that are only notionally Mediterranean.
19889	NYT_ENG_20080713.0144.LDC2009T13	Only Libya refused to attend, and the kings of Morocco and Jordan pleaded other engagements.
19890	NYT_ENG_20080713.0144.LDC2009T13	But other than Libya, the countries were represented by heads of state or prime ministers.
19891	NYT_ENG_20080713.0144.LDC2009T13	While initial accomplishments are likely to be vague, the meeting represented an end to the diplomatic isolation of Assad, who has been ostracized for his alliance with Iran, for his support for Palestinian groups classified by the United States and the European Union as terrorist, and because of allegations of his country's involvement in the 2005 assassination of Rafik Hariri, the former Lebanese prime minister.
19892	NYT_ENG_20080713.0144.LDC2009T13	Syria also attended the U.S.-led Middle East summit meeting at Annapolis, Md., in November.
19893	NYT_ENG_20080713.0144.LDC2009T13	Since then, Israel and Syria have opened serious but indirect peace talks with Turkish mediation, and Assad is eager to rejoin the world, especially with a new American president to be elected this year.
19894	NYT_ENG_20080713.0144.LDC2009T13	On Saturday, Sarkozy claimed a success when Assad and the new Lebanese president, Michel Suleiman, agreed to open embassies in each other's capitals for the first time.
19895	NYT_ENG_20080713.0144.LDC2009T13	Sarkozy said Assad's agreement "to open diplomatic representation in Lebanon is historic progress."
19896	NYT_ENG_20080713.0144.LDC2009T13	But Assad was vague about recognizing Lebanon, a country that Syria has dominated for decades and regards as a Syrian province.
19897	NYT_ENG_20080713.0144.LDC2009T13	"The summit is a nice event, but will the union find an independent life?"
19898	NYT_ENG_20080713.0144.LDC2009T13	a senior diplomat from a southern country said.
19899	NYT_ENG_20080713.0144.LDC2009T13	"Sarkozy's original idea was bold, but there's not much of it left."

19903	NYT_ENG_20080714.0027.LDC2009T13	His death, at the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, was announced by the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association.
19904	NYT_ENG_20080714.0027.LDC2009T13	McSpadden, who lived in Chelsea, Okla., was a past president of the association.

19906	NYT_ENG_20080714.0027.LDC2009T13	McSpadden displayed a dry wit in his own right when comparing his dual callings of rodeo and politics.
19907	NYT_ENG_20080714.0027.LDC2009T13	Last January, when the post office in Chelsea, Okla., was renamed in his honor, McSpadden was quoted by The Tulsa World as observing how "there's an amazing correlation between the two arenas in that there's bull in each profession."

19931	NYT_ENG_20080716.0132.LDC2009T13	never was anyone's idea of a well-constructed stage show, but its good-time disco music by Swedish pop band ABBA was enough to turn it into a global hit.
19932	NYT_ENG_20080716.0132.LDC2009T13	Its weaknesses survive, and the show's cheesy plot and badly matched score only look worse blown up onto the silver screen.
19933	NYT_ENG_20080716.0132.LDC2009T13	Still, no amount of critical naysaying seems likely to dampen the success of this clumsy transfer to celluloid.
19934	NYT_ENG_20080716.0132.LDC2009T13	Meryl Streep stars as Donna, a single mom and former girl group singer, who now runs a hotel on a tiny Greek island.

19936	NYT_ENG_20080716.0132.LDC2009T13	And neither does Donna.

19938	NYT_ENG_20080716.0132.LDC2009T13	Yes, the story has more than a passing resemblance to 1968's "Buona Sera, Mrs. Campbell," but you will never get "Mamma Mia!
19939	NYT_ENG_20080716.0132.LDC2009T13	's" creators to acknowledge the similarities.
19940	NYT_ENG_20080716.0132.LDC2009T13	The show's director, Phyllida Lloyd, makes her film debut, showing less aptitude for camera movement than "The Producers"' Susan Stroman.
19941	NYT_ENG_20080716.0132.LDC2009T13	Nor is she helped by her cinematographer or editor, and rookie screenwriter Catherine Johnson adds a bit to her stage script, where less would have been more.

19954	NYT_ENG_20080723.0109.LDC2009T13	"If I were 25 or 26 and getting married, a bracelet, necklace or matching earrings would be fine," she said.
19955	NYT_ENG_20080723.0109.LDC2009T13	But at 35?
19956	NYT_ENG_20080723.0109.LDC2009T13	"Giving them a bracelet isn't as special as spending an evening together.
19957	NYT_ENG_20080723.0109.LDC2009T13	Plus, as you get older, everyone is more conscientious about their skin and appearance," she said.
19958	NYT_ENG_20080723.0109.LDC2009T13	"Giving them something for themselves -- as opposed to something that they'll never wear again -- is more meaningful."
19959	NYT_ENG_20080723.0109.LDC2009T13	And let's not forget the pictures of college roommates-turned- bridesmaids quickly posted to Facebook.
19960	NYT_ENG_20080723.0109.LDC2009T13	It is no longer sufficient to hire a hairstylist and makeup artist to be on hand the day of.
19961	NYT_ENG_20080723.0109.LDC2009T13	Instead, bridal parties are indulging in dermal fillers and tooth-whitening months before the Big Day.
19962	NYT_ENG_20080723.0109.LDC2009T13	Some brides pick up the tab for their attendants, replacing the pillbox inscribed with the wedding date with a well-earned squirt between the eyes.
19963	NYT_ENG_20080723.0109.LDC2009T13	In other cases, bridesmaids -- who may quietly seethe about unflattering dresses -- are surprisingly willing to pay for cosmetic enhancements.
19964	NYT_ENG_20080723.0109.LDC2009T13	"Most women, when they come in here, they want it," said Camille Meyer, the owner of TriBeCa MedSpa.
19965	NYT_ENG_20080723.0109.LDC2009T13	"They know they're aging."
19966	NYT_ENG_20080723.0109.LDC2009T13	For Karen Hohenstein, who held her party at the Tiffani Kim Institute Medical Wellness Spa in Chicago, convincing her friends was as smooth as a Botoxed forehead.
19967	NYT_ENG_20080723.0109.LDC2009T13	"It wasn't me saying, 'Hey, we all could use a little something,"' she said.
19968	NYT_ENG_20080723.0109.LDC2009T13	"It was, 'I want to do this,' and a couple of people said, 'I do, too."'
19969	NYT_ENG_20080723.0109.LDC2009T13	But for every accommodating pal, there's another who feels going under the knife is beyond the duty of bridesmaid.
19970	NYT_ENG_20080723.0109.LDC2009T13	Becky Lee, 39, a Manhattan photographer, declined when a friend asked her -- and five other attendants -- to have their breasts enhanced.
19971	NYT_ENG_20080723.0109.LDC2009T13	"We're all Asian and didn't have a whole lot of cleavage, and she found a doctor in L.A. who was willing to do four for the price of two," said Lee, who wore a push-up bra instead.
19972	NYT_ENG_20080723.0109.LDC2009T13	Not for nothing are some maids known as slaves of honor, but this kind of cajoling is a recent development on the wedding front.
19973	NYT_ENG_20080723.0109.LDC2009T13	Marie Scalogna-Watkinson, the founder of Spa Chicks on-the-Go, a mobile spa, said she receives five to seven calls a month from brides seeking Botox or Restylane for their bridesmaids.
19974	NYT_ENG_20080723.0109.LDC2009T13	Five years ago, collective makeovers were unheard of, she said.
19975	NYT_ENG_20080723.0109.LDC2009T13	Dr. Fardad Forouzanpour, a cosmetic surgeon in Beverly Hills, Calif., said his business has increased more than 40 percent since he began offering what he calls Bridal Beauty Buffets in 2006.
19976	NYT_ENG_20080723.0109.LDC2009T13	In the last two years, bridal party tuneups have increased roughly 25 percent, estimated Susie Ellis, the president of SpaFinder.com, a site that lists 4,500 spas worldwide.
19977	NYT_ENG_20080723.0109.LDC2009T13	Just as timing matters when it comes to securing a hall, it's best that brides-to-be don't delay scheduling appointments, aestheticians and doctors say.
19978	NYT_ENG_20080723.0109.LDC2009T13	"You wouldn't get a cut and color the week before," said Dr. Jessica Wu, a dermatologist in Beverly Hills who advises coming in three to six months before the big day.
19979	NYT_ENG_20080723.0109.LDC2009T13	"We do a trial run of Botox about four months ahead of time.
19980	NYT_ENG_20080723.0109.LDC2009T13	Then, two weeks before the wedding, we do that last treatment."
19981	NYT_ENG_20080723.0109.LDC2009T13	Meyer of TriBeCa MedSpa suggests that a bride contact her the minute the question is popped.
19982	NYT_ENG_20080723.0109.LDC2009T13	"Brides really appreciate the fact that we put everything in a regimented schedule for them," she said.
19983	NYT_ENG_20080723.0109.LDC2009T13	Since February 2007, she has staged more than 30 bridesmaid parties and has 18 planned so far this year.
19984	NYT_ENG_20080723.0109.LDC2009T13	"If you have to do eight treatments, six weeks apart, that could take up to a year," she said.
19985	NYT_ENG_20080723.0109.LDC2009T13	Fraxel laser could also set you back $1,200 a session, which even without the economic downturn, amounts to quite a bit.
19986	NYT_ENG_20080723.0109.LDC2009T13	These days, Robyn Bomar, an event planner in Destin, Fla., overhears brides doing cost-benefit analyses.
19987	NYT_ENG_20080723.0109.LDC2009T13	"They will never choose Botox over a great dress, but they will say 'Maybe I'll have a buffet over a sit-down at the rehearsal dinner,"' she said.
19988	NYT_ENG_20080723.0109.LDC2009T13	Or: "I'll spend the money on Botox rather than lunch."'
19989	NYT_ENG_20080723.0109.LDC2009T13	In June, Jennifer Peterson, 31, a production director in Los Angeles, and eight friends indulged in Botox, Restylane, massages, facials and microdermabrasion at Infinity MedSpa in Valencia, Calif.
19990	NYT_ENG_20080723.0109.LDC2009T13	Her friends chipped in for her treatments, but she is considering giving them each a $100 certificate to the spa -- a gift she is sure they will appreciate.
19991	NYT_ENG_20080723.0109.LDC2009T13	"Everybody does Botox out here," she said.
19992	NYT_ENG_20080723.0109.LDC2009T13	The beauty procedure thank-you gift is becoming more common, said Bomar, who coordinates about three parties a month.
19993	NYT_ENG_20080723.0109.LDC2009T13	Time was when the bride arranged for everyone to get manicures at the same time, followed by lunch.
19994	NYT_ENG_20080723.0109.LDC2009T13	But today?
19995	NYT_ENG_20080723.0109.LDC2009T13	"It's much more likely that she is footing the bill for eyelash extensions, airbrush tanning and a bevy of other cosmetic procedures," she said.
19996	NYT_ENG_20080723.0109.LDC2009T13	Five years ago, plastic surgeons, dermatologists and tooth- whitening centers "were virtually absent" from bridal expos, said William F. Heaton III, the president of the Great Bridal Expo Group, which produces events in 40 cities nationwide.
19997	NYT_ENG_20080723.0109.LDC2009T13	"Now we're getting a half dozen phone calls a week."
19998	NYT_ENG_20080723.0109.LDC2009T13	This year alone, American Laser Centers, a chain, has participated in 830 bridal shows, said Amanda McInnes, a marketing director.
19999	NYT_ENG_20080723.0109.LDC2009T13	Two weeks ago, Health Travel Guides, a medical tourism company, exhibited at the Dallas Bridal Show for the first time.
20000	NYT_ENG_20080723.0109.LDC2009T13	"We received 30 requests for quotes among the bridal show attendees -- mostly for plastic surgery such as liposuction and breast augmentation," said Sandra Miller, the company's chief marketing officer.
20001	NYT_ENG_20080723.0109.LDC2009T13	"But also many for cosmetic dentistry and inquiries for providing quotes for bachelorette getaways that will feature beauty treatments."
20002	NYT_ENG_20080723.0109.LDC2009T13	A bride's request that you whiten your grayish teeth can strain a relationship.
20003	NYT_ENG_20080723.0109.LDC2009T13	Samantha Goldberg, a wedding planner in Chester, N.J., recalled a bride who asked her attendants to get professionally spray-tanned for a Hawaiian-theme reception.
20004	NYT_ENG_20080723.0109.LDC2009T13	Alas, two women were claustrophobic and couldn't bear standing in a tanning capsule.
20005	NYT_ENG_20080723.0109.LDC2009T13	"They asked the bride if they could use regular tanning cream from a salon," Goldberg said.
20006	NYT_ENG_20080723.0109.LDC2009T13	The bride refused
20007	NYT_ENG_20080723.0109.LDC2009T13	she wanted everyone to be the same shade.
20008	NYT_ENG_20080723.0109.LDC2009T13	The women ultimately declined to be bridesmaids.
20009	NYT_ENG_20080723.0109.LDC2009T13	"Friendships of 20-plus years gone over a spray tan?"
20010	NYT_ENG_20080723.0109.LDC2009T13	Goldberg said.
20011	NYT_ENG_20080723.0109.LDC2009T13	"Sad!"
20012	NYT_ENG_20080723.0109.LDC2009T13	And how does a bride break it to a mother-in-law that she'd love her crow's feet to be frozen into submission?
20013	NYT_ENG_20080723.0109.LDC2009T13	Very delicately.
20014	NYT_ENG_20080723.0109.LDC2009T13	"My mother is in her 60s.
20015	NYT_ENG_20080723.0109.LDC2009T13	She's been talking about it for so long, so I said 'Let's do it,"' said Stacey Berlin, 29, a marketing consultant, who is having a party at Aquamedica Day Spa in Long Branch, N.J.
20016	NYT_ENG_20080723.0109.LDC2009T13	It was trickier with her future mother-in-law.
20017	NYT_ENG_20080723.0109.LDC2009T13	"To her," Berlin said, "I said it as a joke: 'You should do Botox for the wedding!'
20018	NYT_ENG_20080723.0109.LDC2009T13	She giggled, and then I said, 'I'm serious.
20019	NYT_ENG_20080723.0109.LDC2009T13	It's exactly what you need to freshen up.'
20020	NYT_ENG_20080723.0109.LDC2009T13	At first she kind of laughed it off, but the more we talked about it and I told her my mom was going to do it, she said 'OK."'

20022	NYT_ENG_20080818.0071.LDC2009T13	HONDA CR-V THE KING OF THE SMALLER HAULERS
20023	NYT_ENG_20080818.0071.LDC2009T13	The world of more expensive gasoline is trying its level best to bring about the death of big SUVs and pickup trucks.
20024	NYT_ENG_20080818.0071.LDC2009T13	These are the mammoth haulers, the vehicles a brawny nation needs (or thinks it needs) and when you load up half a ton of stuff into a big wagon that already weighs nearly three tons, then hitch a speedboat to the back, you need a brawny engine to pull it all.
20025	NYT_ENG_20080818.0071.LDC2009T13	That burns gas.
20026	NYT_ENG_20080818.0071.LDC2009T13	Lots of it.
20027	NYT_ENG_20080818.0071.LDC2009T13	What to do?
20028	NYT_ENG_20080818.0071.LDC2009T13	One thing is to scale back, which is something many of us seem to be doing.
20029	NYT_ENG_20080818.0071.LDC2009T13	Park the Chevy Suburban and take the bus or train to work.
20030	NYT_ENG_20080818.0071.LDC2009T13	Forego the weekend waterskiing up at the lake because it could set you back more than $150 in fuel alone.
20031	NYT_ENG_20080818.0071.LDC2009T13	But we still need to haul people and things and that's where the smaller SUVs come in -- I prefer to call them wagons, because that's what they are
20032	NYT_ENG_20080818.0071.LDC2009T13	they're just a bit taller than traditional station wagons.
20033	NYT_ENG_20080818.0071.LDC2009T13	The small wagons can easily get in the mid-20s in the mile-per- gallon sweepstakes and still haul more than 70 cubic feet of cargo with the second row of seats down.
20034	NYT_ENG_20080818.0071.LDC2009T13	At least, that's what we found with Honda's 2008 CR-V.
20035	NYT_ENG_20080818.0071.LDC2009T13	The CR-V has become a class-leading favorite in this pack of smaller haulers, a group populated by some stiff competition -- Edmunds.com lists 26 of them, including the Toyota RAV4, Ford Escape, Hyundai Tucson, Subaru Forester and Suzuki Grand Vitara -- and it's done so in quiet way, given that it's been around, in various forms, since it was introduced in 1996.
20036	NYT_ENG_20080818.0071.LDC2009T13	The current incarnation, which came in the 2007 model year, is the kind of car where, if you look at it and its predecessors, you say, "they finally got it right."
20037	NYT_ENG_20080818.0071.LDC2009T13	The first generation CR-V was kind of a gawky-looking underpowered thing.
20038	NYT_ENG_20080818.0071.LDC2009T13	It was replaced in 2002 with a more substantial CR-V, but it looked as if the product planners did the whole inside, then realized they didn't have a place for the spare tire.
20039	NYT_ENG_20080818.0071.LDC2009T13	So they stuck it on a side- opening tailgate, which wasn't the most satisfactory solution.
20040	NYT_ENG_20080818.0071.LDC2009T13	Now, the spare tire is underneath the rear cargo platform and the whole redesign makes the CR-V a far better-looking, far smoother car, particularly for a station wagon.
20041	NYT_ENG_20080818.0071.LDC2009T13	(They're high, they're bulky, they're meant to be practical.)
20042	NYT_ENG_20080818.0071.LDC2009T13	The CR-V comes in three trim levels -- LX, EX and EX-L, the L standing for leather.
20043	NYT_ENG_20080818.0071.LDC2009T13	There's also an EX-L with navigation.
20044	NYT_ENG_20080818.0071.LDC2009T13	You can get front-wheel-drive or all-wheel-drive.
20045	NYT_ENG_20080818.0071.LDC2009T13	The test model we had was the most expensive -- the EX-L with navigation -- and my feeling was that if you're going to have one of these for 10 or 12 years, putting on maybe 150,000 miles, spring for the one with the goodies.
20046	NYT_ENG_20080818.0071.LDC2009T13	For years, I've thought navigation units were superfluous and too expensive -- you can buy a portable unit for much, much less, and you can move it from car to car.
20047	NYT_ENG_20080818.0071.LDC2009T13	But the built-in navis have large screens and you don't have to worry as much about having them stolen.
20048	NYT_ENG_20080818.0071.LDC2009T13	And speaking of the CR-V's navigation unit, when the nav lady speaks, the volume on the audio system conveniently dips low and then recovers its full voice when Ms. Navi is done telling you to make that turn.
20049	NYT_ENG_20080818.0071.LDC2009T13	Inside, Honda has made this crossover car as comfortable as you can get, given it's still a utility vehicle, and it handles highways and smaller byways fine.
20050	NYT_ENG_20080818.0071.LDC2009T13	But it's not an Accord and you aren't going to get that smoother, less jouncy sedan ride that you might expect.
20051	NYT_ENG_20080818.0071.LDC2009T13	The dash is laid out logically, with the two requisite tach and speedo pods, and you also get such niceties as a bar meter that tells you what kind of mileage you're getting.
20052	NYT_ENG_20080818.0071.LDC2009T13	(In a 950-mile trip, we averaged 25.6 miles per gallon, and we weren't exactly lazing along.
20053	NYT_ENG_20080818.0071.LDC2009T13	Try that in your Suburban.)
20054	NYT_ENG_20080818.0071.LDC2009T13	Honda could, however, take a leaf from Toyota's RAV4 playbook and give CR-V customers a choice of a four-cylinder or a V6.
20055	NYT_ENG_20080818.0071.LDC2009T13	The CR-V has a 2.4-liter, 166-horsepower engine and it's, well, adequate to the task, but you do feel and hear that four-cylinder buzz when you hit that freeway on-ramp.
20056	NYT_ENG_20080818.0071.LDC2009T13	The CR-V and RAV4 four- cylinder have identical (22 mpg) mileage figures in the new federal government calculations.
20057	NYT_ENG_20080818.0071.LDC2009T13	The RAV4 V6 version, smoother and more powerful than the two four-bangers, suffers only one mpg by comparison.
20058	NYT_ENG_20080818.0071.LDC2009T13	Other small nits on the CR-V: I liked the stiff panel over the cargo area, but thought it could be higher at the level of the tops of the rear seats.
20059	NYT_ENG_20080818.0071.LDC2009T13	As it is, you can slide a suitcase or two under it, but the space above is wasted since you can only put a max of 20 pounds on the shelf itself.
20060	NYT_ENG_20080818.0071.LDC2009T13	Oddly enough, Honda sells a separate accessory retractable cargo cover that fits over the top part of the cargo area, but you have to go to the Honda parts counter and part with $240 to get it.
20061	NYT_ENG_20080818.0071.LDC2009T13	But it's hard to find much fault with this little SUV.
20062	NYT_ENG_20080818.0071.LDC2009T13	It has plenty of space for five people, it has Honda's vaunted reputation for reliability, and it's not going to break the piggy bank when it's time to fill the tank.

20083	NYT_ENG_20080824.0209.LDC2009T13	"She keeps him in check," said Bethann Hester, 45, of Chicago, a friend of Michelle Obama's for 15 years.
20084	NYT_ENG_20080824.0209.LDC2009T13	"She holds him to a high standard."
20085	NYT_ENG_20080824.0209.LDC2009T13	Michelle Obama takes the stage in Denver Monday night, where she'll seek to sell her husband to America, sharing stories about "the values that drive him, experiences that shaped him, and why I believe he will be an extraordinary president," she said in an e-mail response to questions submitted by The Denver Post.
20086	NYT_ENG_20080824.0209.LDC2009T13	"I'll also share stories about my life and my background with the country."
20087	NYT_ENG_20080824.0209.LDC2009T13	While those details might win some voters, just as important, political historians said, is what Michelle Obama, 45, will reveal about her relationship with her husband and how they'd interact in the White House.
20088	NYT_ENG_20080824.0209.LDC2009T13	The first lady, they said, is the person perhaps best positioned to tell the president the truth when he needs to hear it.
20089	NYT_ENG_20080824.0209.LDC2009T13	"Figuring out what the first lady is going to do in the office is one thing, but even more important is the partnership between a first lady and her husband," said Doris Kearns Goodwin, author of several books on presidents.
20090	NYT_ENG_20080824.0209.LDC2009T13	"That's where the influence can be monumental."
20091	NYT_ENG_20080824.0209.LDC2009T13	Michelle Obama's influence likely will be large.
20092	NYT_ENG_20080824.0209.LDC2009T13	She and her husband are so intertwined that one can't be examined without looking at the other, family and friends say.
20093	NYT_ENG_20080824.0209.LDC2009T13	They finish each other's sentences, needle each other when needed, are best friends, partners and genuinely in love.
20094	NYT_ENG_20080824.0209.LDC2009T13	Asked during an event last week at Saddleback Church in California which three people he trusted most and would rely on as president, Obama named his wife first.
20095	NYT_ENG_20080824.0209.LDC2009T13	"Barack is a wonderful husband and father," Michelle Obama said.
20096	NYT_ENG_20080824.0209.LDC2009T13	"He is a total partner to me -- my best friend, my greatest adviser, my rock.
20097	NYT_ENG_20080824.0209.LDC2009T13	We take great care of each other -- in part because we have complementary strengths.
20098	NYT_ENG_20080824.0209.LDC2009T13	I've helped him become more organized.
20099	NYT_ENG_20080824.0209.LDC2009T13	He's helped me become more patient."
20100	NYT_ENG_20080824.0209.LDC2009T13	Michelle Obama, as described by her family and friends, is equal parts Wonder Woman and Everywoman.
20101	NYT_ENG_20080824.0209.LDC2009T13	A successful businesswoman, she is seen as dedicated to her daughters Malia, 10, and Sasha, 7, adored by her husband, and shaped by the values of her working-class parents.
20102	NYT_ENG_20080824.0209.LDC2009T13	"She's the kindest person that I know," said Yvonne Davila, 49, of Chicago, who's known Michelle Obama since they worked together in Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley's office 18 years ago.
20103	NYT_ENG_20080824.0209.LDC2009T13	At the same time, Michelle Obama has plenty of critics.
20104	NYT_ENG_20080824.0209.LDC2009T13	Obama opponents pounced when she remarked in February, "for the first time in my adult lifetime, I'm really proud of my country."
20105	NYT_ENG_20080824.0209.LDC2009T13	Obama's camp said the remark referred to pride in Americans becoming involved in the democratic process.
20106	NYT_ENG_20080824.0209.LDC2009T13	It's a comment Republicans will remind people of often throughout the election.
20107	NYT_ENG_20080824.0209.LDC2009T13	In eastern Colorado, people who lost their jobs in 2006 when a pickle plant closed question what role Michelle Obama played.
20108	NYT_ENG_20080824.0209.LDC2009T13	She was on the board of directors of TreeHouse Foods, which shuttered the facility.
20109	NYT_ENG_20080824.0209.LDC2009T13	"We started hearing after everybody lost their jobs, (that) she had a lot to do with it," said Michelle Barela, 45, of La Junta, who had worked at the pickle plant 15 years.
20110	NYT_ENG_20080824.0209.LDC2009T13	Obama spokeswoman Jen Psaki told The Denver Post in 2006 that Michelle Obama "was not the sole vote or even major decider on this issue."
20111	NYT_ENG_20080824.0209.LDC2009T13	The daughter of Fraser and Marian Robinson, Michelle Obama grew up in a one-bedroom apartment above her aunt's home on Chicago's South Side.
20112	NYT_ENG_20080824.0209.LDC2009T13	The Robinson children learned an ethic of hard work, especially from Michelle Obama's father, who was diagnosed at age 30 with multiple sclerosis and continued working as a pump operator for the Chicago water department, said Michelle Obama's brother, Craig Robinson, 46.
20113	NYT_ENG_20080824.0209.LDC2009T13	As a result, he said, both he and his sister "value how lucky you are to be able to get up and go to work.
20114	NYT_ENG_20080824.0209.LDC2009T13	You can't complain about anything when you had a dad with MS who gets up and goes to work every day."
20115	NYT_ENG_20080824.0209.LDC2009T13	Michelle Obama went to Princeton University on a scholarship, then Harvard Law School, then to corporate law firm Sidley Austin LLP, where she met Barack Obama in 1989 when she was assigned as his mentor.
20116	NYT_ENG_20080824.0209.LDC2009T13	"They told her this brilliant young Harvard kid is coming here," said author Kearns Goodwin, who talked with Michelle Obama during the 2004 Democratic National Convention.
20117	NYT_ENG_20080824.0209.LDC2009T13	"She felt her job in some ways was to knock him down a few pegs, to keep him in line."
20118	NYT_ENG_20080824.0209.LDC2009T13	On their first date the two saw the Spike Lee movie "Do The Right Thing" and went for ice cream.
20119	NYT_ENG_20080824.0209.LDC2009T13	A few months later, Michelle Obama asked her brother to help evaluate her new beau.
20120	NYT_ENG_20080824.0209.LDC2009T13	"She said,'Hey, take him to play a game of basketball and tell me what you think,' " said Robinson, head basketball coach at Oregon State University.
20121	NYT_ENG_20080824.0209.LDC2009T13	Their father, Robinson said, believed that a basketball game revealed people's personality.
20122	NYT_ENG_20080824.0209.LDC2009T13	"I found him to be extremely confident but not cocky," Robinson said.
20123	NYT_ENG_20080824.0209.LDC2009T13	"I found him to have a good sense of team."
20124	NYT_ENG_20080824.0209.LDC2009T13	The Obamas were married in 1992.
20125	NYT_ENG_20080824.0209.LDC2009T13	Their marriage makes each of them stronger, Robinson said.
20126	NYT_ENG_20080824.0209.LDC2009T13	"They complement each other in a way that makes them both better collectively and individually," Robinson said.
20127	NYT_ENG_20080904.0049.LDC2009T13	BP COMPROMISES ON RUSSIAN OIL VENTURE
20128	NYT_ENG_20080904.0049.LDC2009T13	PARIS
20129	NYT_ENG_20080904.0049.LDC2009T13	BP, the British energy company, agreed Thursday to replace the head of its Russian joint venture and surrender some control on the board to resolve a dispute with its billionaire Russian partners and hold on to its most important source of new oil reserves.
20130	NYT_ENG_20080904.0049.LDC2009T13	Under the deal, the chief executive of the joint venture, Robert Dudley, an American, will step down by the end of the year, to be succeeded by "a Russian-speaking candidate with extensive Russian business experience" who will be nominated by BP.
20131	NYT_ENG_20080904.0049.LDC2009T13	The new chief executive will be charged with improving "transparency, financial returns and the market value of the company's share."
20132	NYT_ENG_20080904.0049.LDC2009T13	The deal, which is to be finalized over the next few months, calls for a reorganization of the TNK-BP board through the appointment of three new independent directors.
20133	NYT_ENG_20080904.0049.LDC2009T13	That could help to end a deadlock in which the partners, each of which has five directors, were unable to agree on strategy.
20134	NYT_ENG_20080904.0049.LDC2009T13	The companies also said they had agreed to an option for TNK-BP to sell up to 20 percent of its shares through an initial public offering, "subject to the consent of the Russian authorities."
20135	NYT_ENG_20080904.0049.LDC2009T13	BP had been locked in a struggle with its four Russian partners, all billionaires, over control of the venture, in which BP and the billionaires' consortium each holds 50 percent.
20136	NYT_ENG_20080904.0049.LDC2009T13	The Russian investors' side of the venture is called AAR, and consists of Viktor Vekselberg, Mikhail Fridman, German Khan and Leonid Blavatnik.
20137	NYT_ENG_20080904.0049.LDC2009T13	Fridman, chairman of the TNK-BP Ltd. board, said in a statement released by AAR that the deal marked "an exciting new chapter in the development of a great company," adding: "As long-term investors, we are ambitious to see our joint venture with BP achieve great success."
20138	NYT_ENG_20080904.0049.LDC2009T13	The BP chairman, Peter Sutherland, said in a separate statement that the deal would ease management conflicts by aligning shareholders' interests.
20139	NYT_ENG_20080904.0049.LDC2009T13	"It will create a stable base from which to grow the joint venture to the benefit of everyone involved," Sutherland said, "including the Russian state for which strong capital investment and continued technical innovation to boost declining oil output are so important."
20140	NYT_ENG_20080904.0049.LDC2009T13	Dudley, whose tenure at the top of the company had become increasingly tenuous, was denied a Russian work visa in July.
20141	NYT_ENG_20080904.0049.LDC2009T13	He has continued to operate as chief executive from abroad.
20142	NYT_ENG_20080904.0049.LDC2009T13	Robert Wine, a BP spokesman in London, said the deal in no way reflected badly on Dudley.
20143	NYT_ENG_20080904.0049.LDC2009T13	"He's an exceptional CEO who's delivered everything that was expected of him and more," Wine said.
20144	NYT_ENG_20080904.0049.LDC2009T13	Uncertainty over the venture has weighed on BP's stock for months, as it has accounted for nearly all of the growth in BP's oil reserves in recent years.
20145	NYT_ENG_20080904.0049.LDC2009T13	On Thursday, BP shares rose 4.3 percent in early London trading.
20146	NYT_ENG_20080904.0049.LDC2009T13	"We are pleased that this situation has been resolved and the shareholders have come to an agreement without the involvement of third parties, including the state," Igor Sechin, deputy prime minister of the Russian Federation, said in the AAR statement.
20147	NYT_ENG_20080904.0049.LDC2009T13	"This is a positive signal for the Russian market.
20148	NYT_ENG_20080904.0049.LDC2009T13	We support the development of TNK-BP and believe that this company has excellent long-term prospects."
20149	NYT_ENG_20080909.0108.LDC2009T13	MCCAIN FOCUSES ON BONUS PAY AND TUTORS
20150	NYT_ENG_20080909.0108.LDC2009T13	In comparison with Sen. Barack Obama's education plan, Sen. John McCain's is terse.
20151	NYT_ENG_20080909.0108.LDC2009T13	Among his short list of initiatives, McCain, the Republican presidential nominee, includes bonus pay for teachers who raise student achievement or who take jobs in hard-to-staff schools, an expansion of after-school tutoring, and new federal support for online schools and for the voucher program in Washington, D.C.
20152	NYT_ENG_20080909.0108.LDC2009T13	The brevity of McCain's plan reflects his view that the federal government should play a limited role in public education, and his commitment to holding the line on education spending, said Lisa Graham Keegan, a McCain adviser and former Arizona education commissioner.
20153	NYT_ENG_20080909.0108.LDC2009T13	"Education is obviously not the issue Sen. McCain spends the most time on," Keegan said, adding that his plan's limited scope should not be interpreted as a lack of commitment to education and school reform.
20154	NYT_ENG_20080909.0108.LDC2009T13	"He's been a quiet and consistent supporter of parents and educators who he thinks are making a difference."
20155	NYT_ENG_20080909.0108.LDC2009T13	McCain would make it easier for students in failing schools to get taxpayer-financed after-school tutoring by private companies.
20156	NYT_ENG_20080909.0108.LDC2009T13	Under President Bush's No Child Left Behind law, students at schools that have repeatedly missed testing goals are eligible, but few parents nationwide have taken advantage of those services.
20157	NYT_ENG_20080909.0108.LDC2009T13	That is because, in McCain's view, local school districts often set up a cumbersome process for certifying the tutors and do a poor job of getting the word out to parents.
20158	NYT_ENG_20080909.0108.LDC2009T13	Under McCain's plan, the federal government would certify tutoring companies, letting them market directly to parents.
20159	NYT_ENG_20080909.0108.LDC2009T13	Both the McCain and Obama plans acknowledge that the No Child Left Behind law has helped the nation focus on closing the achievement gap between minorities and whites, but they also promise changes to the law without offering many specifics.
20160	NYT_ENG_20080909.0108.LDC2009T13	And both are silent on the law's deadline requiring that all students be proficient in reading and math by 2014.
20161	NYT_ENG_20080909.0108.LDC2009T13	Both plans also propose performance pay initiatives.
20162	NYT_ENG_20080909.0108.LDC2009T13	McCain would reallocate 60 percent of the $3 billion in current federal spending on teacher quality programs to finance direct payments to "high-performing teachers" who take jobs in high-needs schools and to those who improve achievement.
20163	NYT_ENG_20080909.0108.LDC2009T13	Obama's plan would offer federal financing to districts that negotiate performance pay programs with teachers unions.
20164	NYT_ENG_20080909.0108.LDC2009T13	It would allow bonuses for veteran teachers who help novice colleagues as well as those who teach in hard-to-staff schools or demonstrate high levels of performance.
20165	NYT_ENG_20080909.0108.LDC2009T13	Both national teachers' unions have endorsed Obama.

20182	NYT_ENG_20081008.0089.LDC2009T13	WASHINGTON
20183	NYT_ENG_20081008.0089.LDC2009T13	Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., the leader of Democratic Party efforts to gain Senate seats in the Nov. 4 elections, said Wednesday that polls show Democratic candidates leading in five states with incumbent Republican senators.
20184	NYT_ENG_20081008.0089.LDC2009T13	Schumer said polls indicate that his party's candidates are ahead in Virginia, New Mexico, Colorado, New Hampshire and Alaska, states now held by Republican senators.
20185	NYT_ENG_20081008.0089.LDC2009T13	Democratic candidates are also doing well in their Senate races in North Carolina and Oregon, Schumer said, and are close in Mississippi, Minnesota, Georgia and Kentucky.
20186	NYT_ENG_20081008.0089.LDC2009T13	"We're doing extremely well in places we didn't expect to do well," Schumer, chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, told reporters on Wednesday, though he declined to predict how many seats he expects the party to win in November.
20187	NYT_ENG_20081008.0089.LDC2009T13	Schumer also maintained that it was "too early" to predict whether his party would end up with the 60 seats needed to block filibusters in the chamber.
20188	NYT_ENG_20081008.0089.LDC2009T13	"The wind is more strongly at our back than ever," Schumer said.
20189	NYT_ENG_20081008.0089.LDC2009T13	"We're doing better.
20190	NYT_ENG_20081008.0089.LDC2009T13	Where it ends up, I don't know."
20191	NYT_ENG_20081008.0089.LDC2009T13	The DSCC raises and distributes campaign funds and recruits and advises candidates.
20192	NYT_ENG_20081008.0089.LDC2009T13	Schumer criticized the Chamber of Commerce, which he termed "a wing" of the Republican Senate campaign committee.
20193	NYT_ENG_20081008.0089.LDC2009T13	The business group has donated money almost exclusively to Senate candidates, rather than House races or the presidential contest, Schumer said.
20194	NYT_ENG_20081008.0089.LDC2009T13	Schumer said the chamber has given over $16 million to Republican candidates this year but only $329,000 to their Democratic counterparts.
20195	NYT_ENG_20081008.0089.LDC2009T13	In a statement responding to Schumer, R. Bruce Josten, the chamber's executive vice president of government affairs, said the organization is "pro-growth and pro-jobs" and supports candidates who work toward these aims.
20196	NYT_ENG_20081008.0089.LDC2009T13	"It's a shame that Sen. Schumer would try to turn our pro-jobs, pro-growth agenda into a partisan issue for his campaign purposes -- especially at a time when our nation needs leadership and unity in Washington," Josten said.
20197	NYT_ENG_20081008.0089.LDC2009T13	"The U.S. Chamber is focused on eliminating barriers to economic growth.
20198	NYT_ENG_20081008.0089.LDC2009T13	To that end, we support candidates and policies that will reduce government waste, reduce taxes, and eliminate lawsuit abuse."
20199	NYT_ENG_20081008.0089.LDC2009T13	Democrats currently maintain a 51-49 advantage in the Senate -- a count that includes two independents: Sen. Bernard Sanders, I-Vt., and Sen. Joe Lieberman, I-Conn., who caucus with the Democrats and thus provide the margin of control of the Senate.
20200	NYT_ENG_20081008.0089.LDC2009T13	Twenty-three of the 35 contested Senate seats on Nov. 4 are held by Republicans.
20201	NYT_ENG_20081008.0089.LDC2009T13	The last time a party gained the 60 seats required to block a filibuster was during the 95th Congress of 1977-1978, when the Democratic Party controlled 61 seats.

20204	NYT_ENG_20081008.0179.LDC2009T13	Philadelphia -- For someone who greets teammates with "que paso" so often it inspired a Dodgers' T-shirt, for someone who grooves to the irresistibly catchy "Paper Planes" dance lyrics, Manny Ramirez sure gets taken seriously.
20205	NYT_ENG_20081008.0179.LDC2009T13	Ramirez has taken the Los Angeles Dodgers further than they have gone in 20 years -- to the National League Championship Series, which begins Thursday night against the Philadelphia Phillies.
20206	NYT_ENG_20081008.0179.LDC2009T13	But there are critics who'd rather he not enjoy the ride.
20207	NYT_ENG_20081008.0179.LDC2009T13	Fox broadcaster Tim McCarver on Tuesday called Ramirez's exit from Boston despicable.
20208	NYT_ENG_20081008.0179.LDC2009T13	Ramirez deflected questions about the comment on Wednesday.
20209	NYT_ENG_20081008.0179.LDC2009T13	Ramirez has been labeled everything from high-maintenance to Terrell Owens in dreadlocks.
20210	NYT_ENG_20081008.0179.LDC2009T13	And yet, he continues to hit.
20211	NYT_ENG_20081008.0179.LDC2009T13	That's what Ramirez has always done, since he was a rookie in Cleveland, since he was a $20 million man in Boston and since he became a cultural phenomenon in Los Angeles the past three months.
20212	NYT_ENG_20081008.0179.LDC2009T13	Reasons to pick the Dodgers to advance to the World Series all eventually come back to Ramirez.
20213	NYT_ENG_20081008.0179.LDC2009T13	He's so good, he helped carry two teams to the postseason this season.
20214	NYT_ENG_20081008.0179.LDC2009T13	So just scribbling his name in the lineup, whether he takes a swing or not, makes the Dodgers better.
20215	NYT_ENG_20081008.0179.LDC2009T13	"I don't know about all that.
20216	NYT_ENG_20081008.0179.LDC2009T13	I just know that I am happy here," said Ramirez, who walked through the bowels of Citizens Bank Park on Wednesday undisturbed and unrecognized in baggy jeans, a white pullover and music strumming in his ears.
20217	NYT_ENG_20081008.0179.LDC2009T13	"I am enjoying the game.
20218	NYT_ENG_20081008.0179.LDC2009T13	I play hard and go home happy.
20219	NYT_ENG_20081008.0179.LDC2009T13	If you are dogging it, that's when you have problems."
20220	NYT_ENG_20081008.0179.LDC2009T13	McCarver is the latest to contend Ramirez did just that in Boston in order to facilitate his exit.
20221	NYT_ENG_20081008.0179.LDC2009T13	His last days in Boston were ugly.
20222	NYT_ENG_20081008.0179.LDC2009T13	Ramirez admits that sometimes "he jogged it out" rather than hustle.
20223	NYT_ENG_20081008.0179.LDC2009T13	But Ramirez has undeniably made an impact in Los Angeles.
20224	NYT_ENG_20081008.0179.LDC2009T13	With Ramirez in the lineup, the Dodgers' batting average has gone from .256 to .280.
20225	NYT_ENG_20081008.0179.LDC2009T13	Runs have spiked from 4.2 to 4.7 per game.
20226	NYT_ENG_20081008.0179.LDC2009T13	So potent is Ramirez that talk here Wednesday centered on what he won't do -- namely be given the opportunity to squash the Phillies.
20227	NYT_ENG_20081008.0179.LDC2009T13	"He's as good as it gets right now, we have to make sure we pitch him intelligently," Phillies closer Brad Lidge said.
20228	NYT_ENG_20081008.0179.LDC2009T13	Shortstop Jimmy Rollins was more blunt:"If Manny is swinging a hot bat, we better not pitch to him, you let somebody else beat you."
20229	NYT_ENG_20081008.0179.LDC2009T13	This Dodgers' lineup bears little resemblance to the one that slogged its way through much of the season.
20230	NYT_ENG_20081008.0179.LDC2009T13	Nomar Garciaparra, Jeff Kent, Andruw Jones, Juan Pierre and shortstops du jour are on the bench.
20231	NYT_ENG_20081008.0179.LDC2009T13	While Ramirez has reveled in his role of hero, Rafael Furcal's return has been just as important in the playoffs.
20232	NYT_ENG_20081008.0179.LDC2009T13	Furcal was one of baseball's best players when he irritated a disc in his back on May 5, missing the next 4 1/2 months.
20233	NYT_ENG_20081008.0179.LDC2009T13	The Dodgers were 18-14, and he was hitting .366.
20234	NYT_ENG_20081008.0179.LDC2009T13	Furcal went 4-for-12 in the division series sweep of the Chicago Cubs, creating havoc that did not exist with miscast Russell Martin or Matt Kemp batting leadoff.
20235	NYT_ENG_20081008.0179.LDC2009T13	"He's a lot like Jimmy Rollins, a switch-hitter with power who can steal bases," Phillies manager Charlie Manuel said.
20236	NYT_ENG_20081008.0179.LDC2009T13	Furcal's return has moved James Loney, a great mistake hitter, into a run-producing spot, with trade acquisition Casey Blake left to give professional at-bats at the bottom of the lineup.
20237	NYT_ENG_20081008.0179.LDC2009T13	"When Blake got here, that's when things started to change," Dodgers manager Joe Torre said.
20238	NYT_ENG_20081008.0179.LDC2009T13	"He's been the glue."
20239	NYT_ENG_20081008.0179.LDC2009T13	Ramirez, though, is the guy Phillies' fans don't want up in a sticky situation.
20240	NYT_ENG_20081008.0179.LDC2009T13	There is nothing about his October performance that is a fluke.
20241	NYT_ENG_20081008.0179.LDC2009T13	He has hit safely in 38 of his past 43 playoff games (57-for-163), and homered twice in the Cubs' brooming.
20242	NYT_ENG_20081008.0179.LDC2009T13	"I look at Manny in this series like Barry Bonds," Manuel said.
20243	NYT_ENG_20081008.0179.LDC2009T13	"He will make you change your ideas on things.
20244	NYT_ENG_20081008.0179.LDC2009T13	He puts pressure on you because you know he can beat you."
20245	NYT_ENG_20081021.0051.LDC2009T13	SHIPS ORDERED TO SLOW DOWN TO SAVE WHALES FOR SUNDAY, OCT. 26.
20246	NYT_ENG_20081021.0051.LDC2009T13	Cox News Service
20247	NYT_ENG_20081021.0051.LDC2009T13	MELBOURNE, Fla. - The giant, lumbering right whales that winter along Florida's coastline will soon be protected by a new federally imposed speed limit on large ships, a victory for environmentalists in a long-running struggle.
20248	NYT_ENG_20081021.0051.LDC2009T13	But the controversy over protecting the whales is far from over.
20249	NYT_ENG_20081021.0051.LDC2009T13	Some shipping industry representatives doubt the scientific studies underpinning the rule, which will lapse in five years if it is not renewed by federal regulators.
20250	NYT_ENG_20081021.0051.LDC2009T13	The measure, which takes effect in December, calls for ships over 65 feet in length to slow to 10 knots in areas out to 20 miles offshore along the Eastern Seaboard where the whales congregate.
20251	NYT_ENG_20081021.0051.LDC2009T13	Environmental groups had asked the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration for a 30-mile slow-speed zone, but nevertheless hailed the new regulation.
20252	NYT_ENG_20081021.0051.LDC2009T13	"It's a huge step for the right whale," said Amy Knowlton, a research scientist at the New England Aquarium, which has studied the whales for decades.
20253	NYT_ENG_20081021.0051.LDC2009T13	"We're disappointed about some aspects of the rule, but it hasn't been so watered down that it won't be effective."
20254	NYT_ENG_20081021.0051.LDC2009T13	Don O'Hare, a spokesman for the World Shipping Council, a trade group that has been critical of the rule, said shippers will cooperate, even as they push for more studies and new technologies they hope will protect the whales without impeding shipping.
20255	NYT_ENG_20081021.0051.LDC2009T13	"While we have differences of opinion with NOAA on what the science says should be done to protect the right whales, the shipping industry respects their efforts and intentions with these new regulations," O'Hare said in an e-mailed response to the new agency rule.
20256	NYT_ENG_20081021.0051.LDC2009T13	Right whales, prized for their oil-rich blubber, were hunted nearly to extinction in the 1800s.
20257	NYT_ENG_20081021.0051.LDC2009T13	The behemoths, which grow as large as 60 feet in length, were easy targets because of their slow movements, their preference for near-shore waters and the fact that their bodies floated after they were killed.
20258	NYT_ENG_20081021.0051.LDC2009T13	They spend their summers off the New England coast, but females come south in winter to give birth off the coasts of Georgia and Florida.
20259	NYT_ENG_20081021.0051.LDC2009T13	Along Florida's coast from Jacksonville to Palm Beach, beach- goers are sometimes delighted to spot the whales during winter months just a few dozen yards off the shoreline.
20260	NYT_ENG_20081021.0051.LDC2009T13	But many do more than simply watch
20261	NYT_ENG_20081021.0051.LDC2009T13	a network of some 800 volunteers have been trained to call in whale sightings, with the information relayed to the Coast Guard, which passes the word to ships.
20262	NYT_ENG_20081021.0051.LDC2009T13	"When they see a whale they call us and once we get photographers to confirm it, we report it," said Julie Albert, coordinator of the right whale project for the Florida Marine Resources Council, a non-profit group based in Brevard County.
20263	NYT_ENG_20081021.0051.LDC2009T13	"The new speed limits will definitely be good for the whales.
20264	NYT_ENG_20081021.0051.LDC2009T13	It's scary that there are so few of them left."
20265	NYT_ENG_20081021.0051.LDC2009T13	Protected by federal regulations for decades, the whales have still struggled to survive.
20266	NYT_ENG_20081021.0051.LDC2009T13	Between 1991 and 2002, 14 whales were confirmed victims of ship strikes, while 8 more died that way between 2002 and 2007.
20267	NYT_ENG_20081021.0051.LDC2009T13	Scientists say more whales may be killed by ships but their bodies never recovered.
20268	NYT_ENG_20081021.0051.LDC2009T13	They also say entanglement in fishing lines is another menace threatening the species.
20269	NYT_ENG_20081021.0051.LDC2009T13	Researchers estimate there are about 300 to 400 right whales remaining.
20270	NYT_ENG_20081021.0051.LDC2009T13	Shippers say the new speed limits may cost them time and money while not being that effective.
20271	NYT_ENG_20081021.0051.LDC2009T13	Federal estimates say the limits should cost less than 1 percent of the $300 billion trade value of U.S. East Coast shipping, and should add only about an hour to the trip into port for most ships.
20272	NYT_ENG_20081021.0051.LDC2009T13	Edwin Fendig III, a harbor pilot in Brunswick, Ga., said ship captains do all they can to avoid the whales and want to see them survive, but worry that the speed limits will increase the danger of accidents.
20273	NYT_ENG_20081021.0051.LDC2009T13	"It's very unsafe for us to drive a ship at 10 knots," he said, noting that the Brunswick shipping channel is only 500 feet wide and holding a giant vessel on course in those confines in stormy weather is a challenge.
20274	NYT_ENG_20081021.0051.LDC2009T13	"We're extremely environmentally sensitive to the whales, but if cargo isn't brought into port in a safe and timely fashion, what will that cost the U.S.?"
20275	NYT_ENG_20081021.0051.LDC2009T13	The federal rule allows an exception for ship captains to exceed the 10-knot limit if they deem it necessary for the safety of the vessel.
20276	NYT_ENG_20081021.0051.LDC2009T13	Researchers have developed high-tech buoys that aid in spotting the whales.
20277	NYT_ENG_20081021.0051.LDC2009T13	Teams from Cornell University and Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution have developed the devices, which listen for whale sounds with underwater hydro-phones and then relay the information by satellite, with the locations eventually passed on to ships.
20278	NYT_ENG_20081021.0051.LDC2009T13	A network of the buoys is already deployed off parts of the New England coast, where the whales congregate in summer.
20279	NYT_ENG_20081021.0051.LDC2009T13	Two of the buoys were set off the Georgia coast near Brunswick last winter, and two will be placed this winter near the entrance to the Jacksonville port.
20280	NYT_ENG_20081021.0051.LDC2009T13	"The goal is to make all the information immediately available to shippers," said Chris Clark of Cornell's Bioacoustics Research Program.
20281	NYT_ENG_20081021.0051.LDC2009T13	Environmentalists, however, point out that the buoys are only effective if the whales are making sounds.
20282	NYT_ENG_20081021.0051.LDC2009T13	"It doesn't substitute for aerial surveys," the method used for decades to locate the whales, said Vicki Cornish of the Ocean Conservancy, an environmental group which pushed for the speed limits.
20283	NYT_ENG_20081021.0051.LDC2009T13	"And funding for the aerial surveys has been cut.
20284	NYT_ENG_20081021.0051.LDC2009T13	We really think it's important these ships slow down.
20285	NYT_ENG_20081021.0051.LDC2009T13	It's only for 20 miles."
20286	NYT_ENG_20081021.0051.LDC2009T13	Cindy Dolaway, a retired teacher from New York who now lives in Brevard County and volunteers for the whale-spotting network, said many people don't know the whales spend part of their lives off the Florida coastline.
20287	NYT_ENG_20081021.0051.LDC2009T13	"It's really exciting to see them," she said.
20288	NYT_ENG_20081021.0051.LDC2009T13	"I tell people they are the length of two school buses.
20289	NYT_ENG_20081021.0051.LDC2009T13	I've seen them right on the other side of the break off the beach."

20296	NYT_ENG_20081101.0132.LDC2009T13	Responding to a report that a Kenyan relative of Sen. Barack Obama was living in the United States illegally, his campaign on Saturday said that he had no knowledge of her immigration status and that "any and all appropriate laws" should be followed.
20297	NYT_ENG_20081101.0132.LDC2009T13	The woman, Zeituni Onyango, referred to as "Auntie Zeituni" in a passage in Obama's memoir, applied for political asylum in the United States in 2004, but a federal immigration judge rejected her request and instructed her to leave the country, said a government official with knowledge of the case who asked not to be identified because of its sensitive nature.
20298	NYT_ENG_20081101.0132.LDC2009T13	Onyango's legal status was first reported by The Associated Press on Friday.
20299	NYT_ENG_20081101.0132.LDC2009T13	The disclosure came as the presidential campaign hurtled toward Election Day on Tuesday, and it left the Obama campaign answering questions about what he knew of her situation.
20300	NYT_ENG_20081101.0132.LDC2009T13	Some Democrats suggested that the timing of the disclosure could have been politically motivated, and some immigration lawyers said that for government officials to disclose information about an asylum applicant was unethical or perhaps illegal.
20301	NYT_ENG_20081101.0132.LDC2009T13	"People are suspicious about stories that surface in the last 72 hours of a national campaign, and I think they're going to put it in that context," David Axelrod, Obama's chief strategist, told reporters on Saturday.
20302	NYT_ENG_20081101.0132.LDC2009T13	Sen. John McCain's campaign declined to comment, and neither McCain nor his running mate, Gov. Sarah Palin, raised the issue on the campaign trail.
20303	NYT_ENG_20081101.0132.LDC2009T13	Kelly Nantel, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency, said that the matter had been referred to the agency's inspector general and office of professional responsibility.
20304	NYT_ENG_20081101.0132.LDC2009T13	Nantel said that she could not comment on the matter.
20305	NYT_ENG_20081101.0132.LDC2009T13	A White House spokesman, Scott Stanzel, said the White House had no involvement in the matter.
20306	NYT_ENG_20081101.0132.LDC2009T13	Onyango is the half- sister of Obama's father and is part of an extensive network of paternal relatives with whom Obama has had limited contact, his aides said.
20307	NYT_ENG_20081101.0132.LDC2009T13	Obama, who was largely raised by his maternal grandparents in Honolulu, first met Onyango when he traveled to Africa as an adult.
20308	NYT_ENG_20081101.0132.LDC2009T13	Axelrod said that Obama and Onyango did not have "a real close relationship."
20309	NYT_ENG_20081101.0132.LDC2009T13	Onyango attended the ceremony when Obama was sworn in to the U.S. Senate in 2004, but campaign officials said the senator had provided no assistance in getting her a tourist visa and did not know the details of her stay.
20310	NYT_ENG_20081101.0132.LDC2009T13	At the time of the ceremony, Onyango and another relative said in interviews that they had flown to the United States from Kenya to witness the moment.
20311	NYT_ENG_20081101.0132.LDC2009T13	Obama last heard from her about two years ago when she called to say she was in Boston, but he did not see her there, the campaign said.
20312	NYT_ENG_20081101.0132.LDC2009T13	Federal Election Commission records list a Zeituni Onyango in South Boston as making a series of contributions, totaling $265, to the Obama campaign, with the most recent contribution, $5, made on Sept. 19.
20313	NYT_ENG_20081101.0132.LDC2009T13	Obama's campaign said the money was being refunded.
20314	NYT_ENG_20081101.0132.LDC2009T13	It is illegal for foreign citizens and immigrants without green cards to make political donations.
20315	NYT_ENG_20081101.0132.LDC2009T13	Aides said that the donations came through the normal channels, and that no one at the campaign knew that Onyango was related to Obama or of her immigration status.
20316	NYT_ENG_20081101.0132.LDC2009T13	The Times of London first reported on Thursday that Onyango lived in public housing in Boston.
20317	NYT_ENG_20081101.0132.LDC2009T13	On Friday, The Associated Press reported that she was in the country illegally and that her case had led to an unusual nationwide directive from the Immigrations and Customs Enforcement requiring that any deportations before Tuesday's election be approved at least at the level of regional directors.
20318	NYT_ENG_20081101.0132.LDC2009T13	Onyango lives in a disabled-access apartment, and worked as a volunteer resident health advocate for the Boston Housing Authority before stopping recently for physical therapy following back surgery, said William McGonagle, deputy director of the authority.
20319	NYT_ENG_20081101.0132.LDC2009T13	On Saturday, a police officer was stationed outside the low brick public housing complex where Onyango lives.

20369	NYT_ENG_20081201.0134.LDC2009T13	For the Big Three automakers to win over Washington lawmakers in their bid for federal aid, they will have to address a key question in the business plans they present Congress with on Tuesday.
20370	NYT_ENG_20081201.0134.LDC2009T13	Just how serious are they about shrinking their vast lineups of different brands and models to match the current harsh reality of the market?
20371	NYT_ENG_20081201.0134.LDC2009T13	Between them, General Motors, Ford Motor and Chrysler sell 112 different car and truck models through 15 brands in the United States.
20372	NYT_ENG_20081201.0134.LDC2009T13	By contrast, the top three Japanese automakers -- Toyota, Honda and Nissan -- have roughly half as many choices with 58 models combined sold through seven brands.
20373	NYT_ENG_20081201.0134.LDC2009T13	A wide range of offerings was historically a source of strength for the American companies when they dominated the vehicle market -- a strategy of providing a car for "every purse and purpose" as Alfred P. Sloan, GM's leader in the 1920s and 1930s, once said.
20374	NYT_ENG_20081201.0134.LDC2009T13	But the Big Three now sell fewer than half of all new vehicles in this country, with a market share of about 47 percent this year, compared with 62 percent just five years ago.
20375	NYT_ENG_20081201.0134.LDC2009T13	Supporting all those models and brands with separate marketing budgets, design teams, dealers and management divisions represents an enormous expense, particularly for GM.
20376	NYT_ENG_20081201.0134.LDC2009T13	The proliferation of models is one big reason why the American companies are losing so much money as vehicle sales slump to their lowest point in 15 years.
20377	NYT_ENG_20081201.0134.LDC2009T13	As part of their plans to get $25 billion in federal aid, the Detroit companies will be making many promises, including symbolic ones.
20378	NYT_ENG_20081201.0134.LDC2009T13	For example, Ford's chief executive, Alan R. Mulally, will offer to take a pay cut from his last year's compensation of $21 million, according to people familiar with the company's plans.
20379	NYT_ENG_20081201.0134.LDC2009T13	Mulally is also traveling to Washington in a Ford Escape Hybrid (two weeks ago, the Big Three CEO's traveled by corporate jet, inviting barbs from lawmakers.
20380	NYT_ENG_20081201.0134.LDC2009T13	GM and Chrysler declined to disclose the travel plans of their leaders this time).
20381	NYT_ENG_20081201.0134.LDC2009T13	But the Big Three also need substantive changes to drastically cut costs, industry analysts said, including trimming their glut of products and sprawling distribution networks to go with their shrinking market shares.
20382	NYT_ENG_20081201.0134.LDC2009T13	"Downsizing brands and models is the minimum they have to do," said John Casesa, a principal in the auto consulting firm the Casesa Shapiro Group.
20383	NYT_ENG_20081201.0134.LDC2009T13	"This can't just be about resizing the companies, but also restructuring them."
20384	NYT_ENG_20081201.0134.LDC2009T13	Ford took a step on Monday toward reducing its brand lineup by announcing plans to consider the sale of Volvo, its Swedish luxury brand that has seen sales fall 28 percent so far this year.
20385	NYT_ENG_20081201.0134.LDC2009T13	"Given the unprecedented external challenges facing Ford and the entire industry, it is prudent for Ford to evaluate options for Volvo," Mulally said.
20386	NYT_ENG_20081201.0134.LDC2009T13	GM is already trying to sell its Hummer brand.
20387	NYT_ENG_20081201.0134.LDC2009T13	In its report to Congress on Tuesday, the company may settle widespread speculation that it is considering selling or eliminating the Saab, Saturn and Pontiac brands as well.
20388	NYT_ENG_20081201.0134.LDC2009T13	People familiar with GM's deliberations said that the company had previously considered a plan earlier this fall to put the Saab and Saturn brands up for sale.
20389	NYT_ENG_20081201.0134.LDC2009T13	But those plans were dropped because of the lack of potential buyers.
20390	NYT_ENG_20081201.0134.LDC2009T13	With a market share so far this year of about 22 percent in the United States, GM is struggling with the costs of filling showrooms with eight separate brand lineups.
20391	NYT_ENG_20081201.0134.LDC2009T13	"Cutting Saab and Hummer are no-brainers because each of them has 0.2 percent of market share, so they're irrelevant," said Jerome P. York, who was a member of GM's board during 2006.
20392	NYT_ENG_20081201.0134.LDC2009T13	"Beyond that, Pontiac looks very suspect to me."
20393	NYT_ENG_20081201.0134.LDC2009T13	But shutting down a brand also is a complicated and costly effort that requires buying out dealers protected by state franchise laws, as well as scaling back production of vehicles.
20394	NYT_ENG_20081201.0134.LDC2009T13	In 2000, GM decided to eliminate its Oldsmobile brand after its sales fell from 1.1 million vehicles in 1985 to about 265,000 a year.
20395	NYT_ENG_20081201.0134.LDC2009T13	But the process took nearly four years and cost GM more than $1 billion.
20396	NYT_ENG_20081201.0134.LDC2009T13	Rick Wagoner, the automaker's chairman, has repeatedly cited the problems of closing Oldsmobile as a prime reason to avoid eliminating more brands.
20397	NYT_ENG_20081201.0134.LDC2009T13	GM, however, is spending down its cash hoard by $2 billion a month, and the company has acknowledged that it is teetering dangerously close to bankruptcy.
20398	NYT_ENG_20081201.0134.LDC2009T13	In asking for up to $12 billion in federal loans, Wagoner told lawmakers last month that the company could run out of cash by the end of the year without government assistance.
20399	NYT_ENG_20081201.0134.LDC2009T13	Shrinking dealer networks may be another key component of the business plans that GM, Ford and Chrysler will present Tuesday in an effort to convince Congress that they have viable, long-term strategies.
20400	NYT_ENG_20081201.0134.LDC2009T13	GM, for example, has about 6,700 dealers in the United States, compared to 1,200 for Toyota (the disparity is even greater when franchises are counted -- GM dealers operate 14,000 franchises for its many brands, compared to 1,600 franchises for Toyota).
20401	NYT_ENG_20081201.0134.LDC2009T13	A thorny question for GM, and to a lesser extent Ford and Chrysler, is whether they can cut the number of dealers without incurring huge expenses to buy them out.
20402	NYT_ENG_20081201.0134.LDC2009T13	The automakers are also bracing for news on Tuesday of yet another dismal month in the marketplace.
20403	NYT_ENG_20081201.0134.LDC2009T13	Sales of new vehicles are expected to fall 27 percent for November from the same period last year, according to the auto research Web site Edmunds.com
20404	NYT_ENG_20081201.0134.LDC2009T13	The forecasts by Edmunds.com suggest that Chrysler's sales were down 41 percent in November, Ford's 33 percent, and GM's 28 percent.
20405	NYT_ENG_20081201.0134.LDC2009T13	Analysts said that dealers are still being hurt by a lack of available credit for consumers who are shopping for new vehicles.
20406	NYT_ENG_20081201.0134.LDC2009T13	"Until credit actually loosens up, we're going to see a suppressed situation that is not sustainable in the long term," said Tom Libby, senior director of industry analysis for J.D. Power and Associates.

20415	NYT_ENG_20081204.0154.LDC2009T13	But these players are women, and their names also serve as signposts on the long road to acceptance and opportunity.

20417	NYT_ENG_20081204.0154.LDC2009T13	Nowhere is that more evident than at Oklahoma, home of the nation's sixth-ranked team, where athletic pedigree may be unmatched by any other team in the country, male or female.
20418	NYT_ENG_20081204.0154.LDC2009T13	Most of the Sooners' 13-player roster is composed of the children of high-level athletes.
20419	NYT_ENG_20081204.0154.LDC2009T13	Oklahoma's 6-foot-4 reserve center, Abi Olajuwon, a junior, is the daughter of the Hall of Famer Hakeem Olajuwon.

20423	NYT_ENG_20081204.0154.LDC2009T13	The opportunities afforded by Title IX have dovetailed with the desire of elite athletes for their children to have similar chances to excel, Oklahoma coach Sherri Coale said.
20424	NYT_ENG_20081204.0154.LDC2009T13	But fathers are not the only influence on female athletes.
20425	NYT_ENG_20081204.0154.LDC2009T13	Increasingly, the role models for this second generation of Title IX competitors are likely to include their mothers.
20426	NYT_ENG_20081204.0154.LDC2009T13	The mothers of Carlee Roethlisberger and Danielle Robinson, the Sooners' point guard, played college basketball, while the mother of guard Lauren Willis was an all-American track and field athlete.
20427	NYT_ENG_20081204.0154.LDC2009T13	Having parents who were standout athletes "completely deters you and you don't want be around sports, or does the opposite and inspires you," said Jessica Mendoza, the president-elect of the Women's Sports Foundation and a two-time Olympic medalist in softball.
20428	NYT_ENG_20081204.0154.LDC2009T13	Her father was a college football player and coach.
20429	NYT_ENG_20081204.0154.LDC2009T13	"A while back, a lot of dads and moms didn't want their daughters to play sports," Mendoza said.
20430	NYT_ENG_20081204.0154.LDC2009T13	"They were fearful they wouldn't be the ideal daughter.

20432	NYT_ENG_20081204.0154.LDC2009T13	Not just for the sweating, but for what they can learn -- leadership, self-confidence, body image, which is a huge issue with girls."
20433	NYT_ENG_20081204.0154.LDC2009T13	The gender playing field is not yet level 26 years after the NCAA began to sponsor women's basketball.

20440	NYT_ENG_20081204.0154.LDC2009T13	"I think that's a natural evolutionary process based on opportunities afforded women, whether it be male athletes or female athletes whose children are exposed to sports at an early age," said Coale, who coached Oklahoma to the national title game in 2002.
20441	NYT_ENG_20081204.0154.LDC2009T13	"They get a mind-set for that.

20445	NYT_ENG_20081204.0154.LDC2009T13	A number of the Oklahoma players were coached by their parents as young girls.

20449	NYT_ENG_20081204.0154.LDC2009T13	But Coale cautioned against the notion that children of high-profile athletes, as a group, had a better understanding of the commitment required to succeed and a greater willingness than others to work hard.
20450	NYT_ENG_20081204.0154.LDC2009T13	"The only commonality I find is that they tend not to be so blown away by the stage, by the media attention, the travel," Coale said.

20463	NYT_ENG_20081204.0154.LDC2009T13	Several parents said that as stereotypes about the femininity of female athletes had faded, elite male athletes seemingly had become more eager to marry elite female athletes instead of say, models or cheerleaders.
20464	NYT_ENG_20081204.0154.LDC2009T13	A result for their children is a double dip in the athletic gene pool.

20494	NYT_ENG_20081212.0130.LDC2009T13	Nearly a million homes and businesses in New England are facing a weekend without electricity after a rare combination of low pressure, moist air, and cold, powerful winds Thursday night and Friday produced a punishing ice storm that swept through the region, felling countless power lines and trees and closing hundreds of roads.
20495	NYT_ENG_20081212.0130.LDC2009T13	The storm, which has caused tens of millions of dollars in damage throughout the region, led Governor Deval Patrick to declare a state of emergency, allowing him to mobilize 500 members of the National Guard to help clear roads and provide support.
20496	NYT_ENG_20081212.0130.LDC2009T13	Patrick, who estimated the cost to the state at about $7 million, said he would seek a presidential disaster declaration to make federal money available for recovery efforts.
20497	NYT_ENG_20081212.0130.LDC2009T13	"I don't think anyone is expecting the power will be back in large numbers for a few days," Patrick said in a telephone interview Friday night.
20498	NYT_ENG_20081212.0130.LDC2009T13	"I think it could be longer than Monday for certain parts of the Commonwealth.
20499	NYT_ENG_20081212.0130.LDC2009T13	We'll know more after a lot of the debris is cleared in the next few days."
20500	NYT_ENG_20081212.0130.LDC2009T13	No deaths or serious injuries were reported, but the storm left utility companies grappling with unprecedented power outages.
20501	NYT_ENG_20081212.0130.LDC2009T13	As much as 4 inches of rain fell over the region from late Tuesday night through Friday morning as a low-pressure system from the south and a cold front from the north stalled over New England.
20502	NYT_ENG_20081212.0130.LDC2009T13	But the Boston area, which had only torrential rain, did not experience the icing that areas outside Interstate 495 and along the New Hampshire border did, where the rain immediately froze on contact with the ground and everything else it touched.
20503	NYT_ENG_20081212.0130.LDC2009T13	"Nobody expected that the impact of this storm to be quite so devastating," Worcester Mayor Konstantina Lukes said.
20504	NYT_ENG_20081212.0130.LDC2009T13	"Trees are falling on cars, they are falling on houses, and they are trapping people in their homes."
20505	NYT_ENG_20081212.0130.LDC2009T13	In Massachusetts, about 326,000 customers lost electricity.
20506	NYT_ENG_20081212.0130.LDC2009T13	In New Hampshire, which also declared a state of emergency, more than 400,000 homes and business were in the dark.
20507	NYT_ENG_20081212.0130.LDC2009T13	And in Maine, 200,000 lost power, according to the state's emergency management agency.

20511	NYT_ENG_20081212.0130.LDC2009T13	In Vermont, at least 36,000 utility customers lost electricity, and power went out for about 6,000 National Grid customers in Rhode Island.
20512	NYT_ENG_20081212.0130.LDC2009T13	"What we're seeing is unprecedented in terms of New Hampshire storms," said Martin Murray, a spokesman for Public Service of New Hampshire, which provides electricity to about 72 percent of the state.
20513	NYT_ENG_20081212.0130.LDC2009T13	"We've never had any power outages approaching this.
20514	NYT_ENG_20081212.0130.LDC2009T13	Virtually every part of the state is affected, and the damage is extensive."
20515	NYT_ENG_20081212.0130.LDC2009T13	With the number of work crews overburdened, New Hampshire and Maine sought help from Canada.
20516	NYT_ENG_20081212.0130.LDC2009T13	"It's just a massive task, and there isn't a lot of mutual aid available," said Lynette Miller, a spokeswoman for the Maine Emergency Management Agency.
20517	NYT_ENG_20081212.0130.LDC2009T13	"In terms of the effects and number of outages, we haven't seen this many issues in a decade."
20518	NYT_ENG_20081212.0130.LDC2009T13	National Grid, which serves 1.2 million customers in Massachusetts, had more than 650 crews working around the state to repair power lines, and they called in help from as far as Washington, D.C., and Ohio.
20519	NYT_ENG_20081212.0130.LDC2009T13	"This is an extreme situation," said Debbie Drew, a spokesman for National Grid.
20520	NYT_ENG_20081212.0130.LDC2009T13	"This will be a multiday restoration effort."
20521	NYT_ENG_20081212.0130.LDC2009T13	Throughout the region, the storm destroyed roofs, shuttered businesses, and made just about everything more difficult.
20522	NYT_ENG_20081212.0130.LDC2009T13	Trains throughout the region were delayed or canceled.
20523	NYT_ENG_20081212.0130.LDC2009T13	Crowds of customers at hardware stores jostled to buy generators.
20524	NYT_ENG_20081212.0130.LDC2009T13	Blood banks collections were hampered.
20525	NYT_ENG_20081212.0130.LDC2009T13	"There's tons and tons of debris out there, which is impacting the utilities' ability to restore power," said Peter Judge, a spokesman for the Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency.
20526	NYT_ENG_20081212.0130.LDC2009T13	"It's as bad as we've seen at least over the last 10 years."
20527	NYT_ENG_20081212.0130.LDC2009T13	With signal systems down and trees blocking tracks, there was also widespread disruption of service on all commuter rail trains leaving North Station.
20528	NYT_ENG_20081212.0130.LDC2009T13	"This morning was as bad as it gets.
20529	NYT_ENG_20081212.0130.LDC2009T13	... Mother Nature wreaked havoc," said Scott Farmelant, a spokesman for the Massachusetts Bay Commuter Railroad Company.
20530	NYT_ENG_20081212.0130.LDC2009T13	There may have been at least one victim attributable to the storm.
20531	NYT_ENG_20081212.0130.LDC2009T13	Authorities in Marlborough were searching for Kevin Connolly, 50, a Department of Public Works employee whose city- issued truck was found abandoned by a creek behind the department's parking lot.
20532	NYT_ENG_20081212.0130.LDC2009T13	He was last seen at about 4 a.m. Friday after he reported to work and was dispatched to help sand roads and clear tree limbs.
20533	NYT_ENG_20081212.0130.LDC2009T13	"There has been an enormous amount of people" looking for him, said Marlborough police Lieutenant Tom Boland.
20534	NYT_ENG_20081212.0130.LDC2009T13	Hardest hit in Massachusetts was northern Worcester County, where more than 100,000 homes remained without electricity Friday afternoon.
20535	NYT_ENG_20081212.0130.LDC2009T13	Worcester had the additional problem of controlling all the downed limbs, many of which are infested with Asian long- horned beetles.
20536	NYT_ENG_20081212.0130.LDC2009T13	Worcester officials called on residents to leave the fallen branches for street cleanup crews or take them to designated city chipping centers, so the beetles do not spread to other areas.
20537	NYT_ENG_20081212.0130.LDC2009T13	"We were supposed to start removing the trees next week from public property, but that might be delayed now," said Christina Andreoli, a spokeswoman for City Manager Michael V. O'Brien.
20538	NYT_ENG_20081212.0130.LDC2009T13	Neighborhoods in the northern and western parts of Worcester were most affected and three high schools were opened as emergency shelters.
20539	NYT_ENG_20081212.0130.LDC2009T13	An estimated 25,000 people there were without power Friday night, she said.
20540	NYT_ENG_20081212.0130.LDC2009T13	On Ogden Avenue in Worcester, the problem was the once-massive tree in Dave Rousseau's backyard.
20541	NYT_ENG_20081212.0130.LDC2009T13	One branch broke off at about 3 a.m. and fell onto the cars and trucks in Rousseau's driveway, denting and damaging hoods, roofs, and doors of the vehicles.
20542	NYT_ENG_20081212.0130.LDC2009T13	About an hour later, a tree trunk came to rest on a neighboring three-decker.
20543	NYT_ENG_20081212.0130.LDC2009T13	"We've got to look on the bright side," Rousseau said.
20544	NYT_ENG_20081212.0130.LDC2009T13	"No one was hurt."
20545	NYT_ENG_20081212.0130.LDC2009T13	Downed trees and sagging power lines also made many roads impassable in Fitchburg, Leominster, and Holden, where so much ice and debris rained from trees that parents sent children outside to play wearing bicycle helmets.
20546	NYT_ENG_20081212.0130.LDC2009T13	After spending the night before his birthday in the basement of their single-story home in Holden, Mike Fahey awoke to find a tree that cleaved into two separate trunks.
20547	NYT_ENG_20081212.0130.LDC2009T13	"I took a picture and I told my wife, 'These trees are coming down,"' he said.
20548	NYT_ENG_20081212.0130.LDC2009T13	Seconds later, both trunks gave way.
20549	NYT_ENG_20081212.0130.LDC2009T13	One slammed onto the roof of Fahey's home.
20550	NYT_ENG_20081212.0130.LDC2009T13	"This is a not a good birthday," he said.
20551	NYT_ENG_20081212.0130.LDC2009T13	Every tree and utility wire in Holden seemed to be encased in ice, some of which appeared to be an inch thick.
20552	NYT_ENG_20081212.0130.LDC2009T13	Power and utility lines were down on every street and some side roads were blocked by fallen branches.
20553	NYT_ENG_20081212.0130.LDC2009T13	Utility lines sagged over Main Street, and residents flagged them with cloth and pieces of plastic.
20554	NYT_ENG_20081212.0130.LDC2009T13	On other streets, residents built paths between piles of branches to guide drivers.
20555	NYT_ENG_20081212.0130.LDC2009T13	Authorities throughout the state also eyed cresting rivers.
20556	NYT_ENG_20081212.0130.LDC2009T13	The 2 to 4 inches of rain that fell during the storm caused minor flooding.
20557	NYT_ENG_20081212.0130.LDC2009T13	The headwaters of the Charles River in Medway rose just above the flood stage, as did the Aberjona River in Winchester, the Old Swamp River in South Weymouth, and the Jones Brook in Billerica.
20558	NYT_ENG_20081212.0130.LDC2009T13	The good news to report is that the weather is improving.
20559	NYT_ENG_20081212.0130.LDC2009T13	With the storm now hovering somewhere over the Atlantic, the sun will shine throughout the metropolitan area over the weekend, said Alan Dunham, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Taunton.
20560	NYT_ENG_20081212.0130.LDC2009T13	The temperature Saturday should reach a high of 29 degrees but fall to 19 Saturday.

20562	NYT_ENG_20081212.0130.LDC2009T13	Sunday, there will be a few more clouds, but the temperature should rise into the 40s.

20564	NYT_ENG_20081216.0069.LDC2009T13	MADOFF ' S METHOD
20565	NYT_ENG_20081216.0069.LDC2009T13	How did he fool all those people?
20566	NYT_ENG_20081216.0069.LDC2009T13	That question comes up every time a new investment con, especially any Ponzi-style scam, is exposed to the light of day.
20567	NYT_ENG_20081216.0069.LDC2009T13	The Bernard Madoff case raises it one more time, along with a special sense of amazement.
20568	NYT_ENG_20081216.0069.LDC2009T13	For one thing, the numbers (something between $24 billion and $50 billion from a long list of clients) are unprecedented.
20569	NYT_ENG_20081216.0069.LDC2009T13	But the particular people and institutions who lost all that money by investing with Madoff are even more intriguing.
20570	NYT_ENG_20081216.0069.LDC2009T13	The people at the head of the list are uniformly wealthy and sophisticated when it comes to money.
20571	NYT_ENG_20081216.0069.LDC2009T13	The institutions - investment vehicles and private banks around the world - exist to protect their rich clients from hidden financial risk.
20572	NYT_ENG_20081216.0069.LDC2009T13	These are the last people and organizations anyone would expect to get taken by an investment scam.
20573	NYT_ENG_20081216.0069.LDC2009T13	It turns out they were attracted by one reliable element of most long-term investment scams.
20574	NYT_ENG_20081216.0069.LDC2009T13	Reports of consistently good but never spectacular gains can lull all kinds of investors into a false sense of security over time.
20575	NYT_ENG_20081216.0069.LDC2009T13	Though some Madoff investors are extremely wealthy, many others, like George Rautenberg of Lexington, are merely well-off.
20576	NYT_ENG_20081216.0069.LDC2009T13	Rautenberg, now 85, first invested with Madoff in 1992 and earned very steady returns over the next 16 years.
20577	NYT_ENG_20081216.0069.LDC2009T13	He kept a close eye on the details of his account and believed Madoff's strategy would in fact produce the kinds of gains recorded.
20578	NYT_ENG_20081216.0069.LDC2009T13	"They weren't outrageous compared with what Harvard was telling you they were doing and what all those other smart guys were doing," says Rautenberg, who invested after he and his brother sold their Boston manufacturing company.
20579	NYT_ENG_20081216.0069.LDC2009T13	"He wasn't winning big at all in the good years.
20580	NYT_ENG_20081216.0069.LDC2009T13	He stayed fairly stable."
20581	NYT_ENG_20081216.0069.LDC2009T13	How stable?
20582	NYT_ENG_20081216.0069.LDC2009T13	Here are the annual returns Rautenberg's account earned over the past decade: 11.5 percent in 2007, 13.36 percent in 2006, 10 percent in 2005, 10.52 percent in 2004, 10.37 percent in 2003, 13.9 percent in 2002, and 14 percent in 2001.
20583	NYT_ENG_20081216.0069.LDC2009T13	Numbers like that have an obvious appeal, and they are a staple of modern Ponzi schemes.
20584	NYT_ENG_20081216.0069.LDC2009T13	Clients buy into the idea they are acting conservatively, choosing a manager who never swings for the fences, but still makes plenty of money for them.
20585	NYT_ENG_20081216.0069.LDC2009T13	They believe they have chosen the responsible path and put their money in relatively safe hands.
20586	NYT_ENG_20081216.0069.LDC2009T13	Be honest: Wouldn't you?
20587	NYT_ENG_20081216.0069.LDC2009T13	Of course, there's more to it than that.
20588	NYT_ENG_20081216.0069.LDC2009T13	Big investment cons commonly penetrate tight social circles, and friends reinforce each other's faith in the person holding their money.
20589	NYT_ENG_20081216.0069.LDC2009T13	Hustler investment managers keep moving money, robbing Peter to pay Paul, until someone wants too much cash back and the whole con falls on its face.
20590	NYT_ENG_20081216.0069.LDC2009T13	The lure of solid, low-risk returns appeal to rich and middle- class investors alike.
20591	NYT_ENG_20081216.0069.LDC2009T13	Clients who are savvy about money and those without much financial experience can feel the attraction.
20592	NYT_ENG_20081216.0069.LDC2009T13	While FBI agents were arresting Madoff in New York Thursday, another financial con man was making his own court appearance in Boston.

20594	NYT_ENG_20081216.0069.LDC2009T13	Bleidt is serving 11 years in prison for swindling more than 100 clients who lost $27 million in what passed for a notorious case at the time.
20595	NYT_ENG_20081216.0069.LDC2009T13	He testified last week in a lawsuit brought by investors trying to squeeze money out of his old firm's bank, alleging it should have caught on to the scam.
20596	NYT_ENG_20081216.0069.LDC2009T13	The money in the Bleidt case pales in comparison with the billions lost by people who invested with Madoff.
20597	NYT_ENG_20081216.0069.LDC2009T13	Most clients who gave Bleidt their money, sometimes their life savings, weren't rich and never claimed to be financial experts.
20598	NYT_ENG_20081216.0069.LDC2009T13	But they heard a familiar story.
20599	NYT_ENG_20081216.0069.LDC2009T13	Bleidt kept clients happy with promises of the same kind of reliable, moderate returns.
20600	NYT_ENG_20081216.0069.LDC2009T13	He told them not to expect to shoot the lights out.
20601	NYT_ENG_20081216.0069.LDC2009T13	They were sold.
20602	NYT_ENG_20081216.0069.LDC2009T13	No regulator or other outsider was paying very much attention to Brad Bleidt.
20603	NYT_ENG_20081216.0069.LDC2009T13	Lots of people looked closely at Bernie Madoff's business and some were skeptical, but no one stopped him.
20604	NYT_ENG_20081216.0069.LDC2009T13	Both were exposed the way all financial cons eventually end.
20605	NYT_ENG_20081216.0069.LDC2009T13	Sooner or later, too many people want their money back and it just isn't there.

20609	NYT_ENG_20081222.0205.LDC2009T13	VIENNA, Va.
20610	NYT_ENG_20081222.0205.LDC2009T13	When a dozen consumers gathered over the weekend to discuss health care at the behest of President-elect Barack Obama, they quickly agreed on one point: They despise health insurance companies.
20611	NYT_ENG_20081222.0205.LDC2009T13	They also agreed that health care was a right
20612	NYT_ENG_20081222.0205.LDC2009T13	that insurance should cover "everything," not just some services
20613	NYT_ENG_20081222.0205.LDC2009T13	and that coverage should be readily available from the government, as well as from employers.
20614	NYT_ENG_20081222.0205.LDC2009T13	Those were the conclusions of a house party held here in Northern Virginia at the home of Karima Hijane and Theodore A. Kolovos, information technology consultants who have been married for seven years.
20615	NYT_ENG_20081222.0205.LDC2009T13	It was one of more than 4,200 such events being held around the country Dec. 15-31, as part of an experiment in grass- roots politics and policy-making, to provide recommendations to the president-elect.
20616	NYT_ENG_20081222.0205.LDC2009T13	One of the people seated around Hijane's dining room table, Bruce D. Chatman, worked for IBM for 29 years.
20617	NYT_ENG_20081222.0205.LDC2009T13	Corporations, he said, have too much influence in the legislative process and the health care system.
20618	NYT_ENG_20081222.0205.LDC2009T13	He wants to counterbalance their power with the energy and passion of citizens lobbying for themselves.
20619	NYT_ENG_20081222.0205.LDC2009T13	Shiva S. Makki, an economist, complained that in many cases, insurers did not cover the costs of screening procedures and preventive care.
20620	NYT_ENG_20081222.0205.LDC2009T13	Dr. Lawrence M. Nelson, a scientist at the National Institutes of Health who emphasized that he was speaking as a private citizen, said: "The incentives in the current health insurance system are upside down.
20621	NYT_ENG_20081222.0205.LDC2009T13	The less care you provide, the bigger your profits."
20622	NYT_ENG_20081222.0205.LDC2009T13	Nelson said he liked Obama's proposal to create a new public plan, similar to Medicare, that would compete with private insurance companies.
20623	NYT_ENG_20081222.0205.LDC2009T13	Hamudi Almasri, a 35-year-old information technology consultant, said that when he changed jobs, he had to change health plans and doctors.
20624	NYT_ENG_20081222.0205.LDC2009T13	"If I change employers, why should it be such a hassle?"
20625	NYT_ENG_20081222.0205.LDC2009T13	Almasri asked.
20626	NYT_ENG_20081222.0205.LDC2009T13	The Obama transition team did not ask people how a new health care system should be financed, but several people here said that individuals and businesses should have to pay a small health care tax -- some preferred to call it a "contribution" -- so that everyone could be covered.
20627	NYT_ENG_20081222.0205.LDC2009T13	Chatman said he expected insurance companies and others in the health care industry to resist many of Obama's proposals.
20628	NYT_ENG_20081222.0205.LDC2009T13	"This is warfare for the health care of our country," Chatman said.
20629	NYT_ENG_20081222.0205.LDC2009T13	"The question is, Will money win, or will the people win?
20630	NYT_ENG_20081222.0205.LDC2009T13	If we lose, we'll be a second-class country."

20647	NYT_ENG_20081226.0131.LDC2009T13	As a high school senior, Jeff Feagles was encouraged by his football coach to play free safety.
20648	NYT_ENG_20081226.0131.LDC2009T13	Feagles stood 6 feet 1 inch and weighed about 200 pounds, the perfect size for the last line of defense.
20649	NYT_ENG_20081226.0131.LDC2009T13	"I was supposed to make a lot of tackles," he said.
20650	NYT_ENG_20081226.0131.LDC2009T13	"I hated it.
20651	NYT_ENG_20081226.0131.LDC2009T13	I was always getting the wind knocked out of me.
20652	NYT_ENG_20081226.0131.LDC2009T13	That stuck with me: I am not going to do this."
20653	NYT_ENG_20081226.0131.LDC2009T13	So he doesn't.
20654	NYT_ENG_20081226.0131.LDC2009T13	Feagles, the Giants' punter who is in his 21st NFL season, has made only 11 tackles in the past 15 years.
20655	NYT_ENG_20081226.0131.LDC2009T13	It makes him among the active players most desperate to avoid contact.
20656	NYT_ENG_20081226.0131.LDC2009T13	Kickers and punters have long been snidely considered something less than football players, and Feagles actually embraces the life apart.
20657	NYT_ENG_20081226.0131.LDC2009T13	He considers himself a specialist.
20658	NYT_ENG_20081226.0131.LDC2009T13	But he may soon be obsolete: The most recent generation of kickers and punters seem to have made a philosophical choice to reject their reputation and dive into the pile.
20659	NYT_ENG_20081226.0131.LDC2009T13	Jay Feely of the Jets, regarded by his peers as the most aggressive and perhaps craziest tackler among today's kickers, recently notched one against San Francisco.
20660	NYT_ENG_20081226.0131.LDC2009T13	It was his fourth of the season and the 27th of his eight-year career, according to Stats LLC.
20661	NYT_ENG_20081226.0131.LDC2009T13	Feely and his counterpart on the Arizona Cardinals, Neil Rackers, enjoy tackling so much that they made a friendly wager before their teams played in September over who would make more tackles in the game.
20662	NYT_ENG_20081226.0131.LDC2009T13	Neither was credited with even an assist, although Rackers has recorded six tackles this season to lead all kickers.
20663	NYT_ENG_20081226.0131.LDC2009T13	In November, Jacksonville punter Adam Podlesh proved the folly of having a kicker channel his inner Ray Lewis when he sustained a season-ending knee injury in his money leg while trying to make a tackle.
20664	NYT_ENG_20081226.0131.LDC2009T13	Podlesh said he had since experienced fleeting thoughts that maybe he should avoid tackling to keep himself healthy.
20665	NYT_ENG_20081226.0131.LDC2009T13	Then again, he doubts he will shy away next season.
20666	NYT_ENG_20081226.0131.LDC2009T13	"It's kind of cool getting down there and living the glory days of high school," said Podlesh, who was a starting linebacker in high school and has been relatively prolific with five tackles the past two seasons.
20667	NYT_ENG_20081226.0131.LDC2009T13	"At the same time, it's also a job.
20668	NYT_ENG_20081226.0131.LDC2009T13	In my mind, I might as well try.
20669	NYT_ENG_20081226.0131.LDC2009T13	One thing I don't like is people questioning my effort."

20671	XIN_ENG_20070104.0162.LDC2009T13	BEIJING, Jan. 4 (Xinhua)
20672	XIN_ENG_20070104.0162.LDC2009T13	The Chinese government on Thursday urged local authorities to step up efforts to care for leprosy patients and fight social discrimination.
20673	XIN_ENG_20070104.0162.LDC2009T13	Despite sustained efforts -- and considerable success -- in bringing the disease under control, leprosy is still a serious disease in some parts of China and people who have been cured of the disease continue to suffer discrimination.
20674	XIN_ENG_20070104.0162.LDC2009T13	As World Leprosy Day approaches on Jan. 28, the Ministry of Health and three other departments have asked local authorities to offer more care to leprosy sufferers by carrying out home visits and providing new facilities.
20675	XIN_ENG_20070104.0162.LDC2009T13	Leprosy, which is one of the oldest recorded diseases in the world -- first mentioned in writing in 600 B.C. -- causes deformities and nerve damage.
20676	XIN_ENG_20070104.0162.LDC2009T13	It incubates in the human body for up to 20 years and is transmitted via droplets from the nose and mouth during contact with untreated, infected sufferers.
20677	XIN_ENG_20070104.0162.LDC2009T13	However, it can be cured by a sustained year-long antibiotic treatment.
20678	XIN_ENG_20070104.0162.LDC2009T13	China had reported and treated 500,000 leprosy cases by the end of 2005, 60 percent of them in the nation's southwestern areas.
20679	XIN_ENG_20070104.0162.LDC2009T13	While the disease is under general control, the situation in some areas is worsening, says the health ministry.
20680	XIN_ENG_20070104.0162.LDC2009T13	The government has asked local authorities to wage an education campaign about the prevention and control of the disease, and called for the eradication of discrimination against leprosy patients.
20681	XIN_ENG_20070104.0162.LDC2009T13	"Society should mobilize to support and care for leprosy patients.
20682	XIN_ENG_20070104.0162.LDC2009T13	Their living, treatment and convalescence problems must be actively managed," the department said in a statement on Thursday.
20683	XIN_ENG_20070104.0162.LDC2009T13	Officials should pay visits to leprosy hospitals and families and send them Spring Festival greetings, it says.
20684	XIN_ENG_20070104.0162.LDC2009T13	Last July, the health ministry published a leprosy control plan, vowing to eradicate the disease in Anhui and Qinghai by 2008 and in Chongqing, Guangdong and Shaanxi by 2010.
20685	XIN_ENG_20070104.0162.LDC2009T13	The government has been providing free treatment for leprosy patients.
20686	XIN_ENG_20070104.0162.LDC2009T13	But there are still 6,300 leprosy patients in the country, and the number is currently increasing by 1,600 a year.
20687	XIN_ENG_20070104.0162.LDC2009T13	Most leprosy cases are found in Yunnan, Guizhou, Sichuan, Hunan and Tibet.
20688	XIN_ENG_20070104.0162.LDC2009T13	Children account for 2.1 percent of new cases.

20742	XIN_ENG_20070226.0133.LDC2009T13	"We value Russia's position and we want to discuss the results of the agreement, recently reached in Mecca, with the Russian leadership," Meshaal was quoted by the Interfax news agency as saying upon arrival.
20743	XIN_ENG_20070226.0133.LDC2009T13	"We lay weight on Russia's position regarding the lifting of the economic blockade on Palestine," he said.
20744	XIN_ENG_20070226.0133.LDC2009T13	"Our goal is to launch interaction between the international community and the new Palestinian government.
20745	XIN_ENG_20070226.0133.LDC2009T13	The agreement reached in Mecca underscores certain progress and makes our program public," he said.
20746	XIN_ENG_20070226.0133.LDC2009T13	The rival Palestinian movements Fatah and Hamas agreed in the Saudi holy city of Mecca earlier this month to form a national unity government to replace the Hamas-led government in a bid to lift the siege on the Palestinians.
20747	XIN_ENG_20070226.0133.LDC2009T13	Meshaal said Israel was "not making concessions" in negotiations and appealed to the Quartet and Israel to respect the Mecca deal.
20748	XIN_ENG_20070226.0133.LDC2009T13	"The Quartet of international mediators should discuss with Israel the issue of respect for the agreement reached in Mecca," he said.

20774	XIN_ENG_20070313.0139.LDC2009T13	WELLINGTON, March 13 (Xinhua)
20775	XIN_ENG_20070313.0139.LDC2009T13	Fiji's deposed Prime Minister Laisenia Qarase is seeking a court order to allow him to return to capital Suva since last December coup.
20776	XIN_ENG_20070313.0139.LDC2009T13	His lawyer Tevita Fa confirmed that they are looking into the matter.
20777	XIN_ENG_20070313.0139.LDC2009T13	According to Radio NZ, Qarase's lawyer, Tevita Fa, said Tuesday while Qarase already has a case before the High Court challenging the legality of the interim administration, that does not stop him bringing an additional case.
20778	XIN_ENG_20070313.0139.LDC2009T13	"Under the constitution, Qarase's right to free movement in Fiji is guaranteed and that right can't be taken away by decree," said Fa.
20779	XIN_ENG_20070313.0139.LDC2009T13	"It will be a case filed separately (to the current case challenging the military overthrow)," said Fa.
20780	XIN_ENG_20070313.0139.LDC2009T13	Qarase has been on his home island in the Lau group since he fled the capital after the military coup.
20781	XIN_ENG_20070313.0139.LDC2009T13	He has not been allowed back into Suva since then with airlines and shipping companies reportedly told not to give Qarase passage.
20782	XIN_ENG_20070313.0139.LDC2009T13	Qarase has questioned why the army is prohibiting him from leaving his island home on Mavana, Lau since the coup.
20783	XIN_ENG_20070313.0139.LDC2009T13	Qarase has described the military's action as ungodly and inexplicable.
20784	XIN_ENG_20070313.0139.LDC2009T13	He also said that he "will come to Suva when he wants to", but is enjoying the island lifestyle for now.
20785	XIN_ENG_20070313.0139.LDC2009T13	But Qarase is now facing more pressure.
20786	XIN_ENG_20070313.0139.LDC2009T13	The police in Fiji are investigating whether he should be charged with treason over the allegations he called for armed intervention from Australia and New Zealand to prevent the coup.
20787	XIN_ENG_20070313.0139.LDC2009T13	Under Fijian law, anyone who instigates an invasion from abroad may be charged with treason.
20788	XIN_ENG_20070313.0139.LDC2009T13	But Qarase has publicly denied the allegation, said Fijilive, a Suva-based news service.
20789	XIN_ENG_20070313.0139.LDC2009T13	Qarase said he is obliged to assist police with their investigations over allegations of treason.
20790	XIN_ENG_20070313.0139.LDC2009T13	Qarase said he understands what he has to do when police arrive and will assist officers.
20791	XIN_ENG_20070313.0139.LDC2009T13	Qarase said, however, there is a double standard operating because police have dropped investigations into the military commander's actions in conducting the coup.
20792	XIN_ENG_20070313.0139.LDC2009T13	Commodore Voreqe Bainimarama, Fiji's military chief, now the interim Prime Minister, overthrew Qarase with the support of the 3, 500-strong armed forces after accusing the government of corruption.
20793	XIN_ENG_20070313.0139.LDC2009T13	"I am concerned, the allegations are of absolutely no basis.
20794	XIN_ENG_20070313.0139.LDC2009T13	I see no reason why I am being investigated," said Qarase.
20795	XIN_ENG_20070313.0139.LDC2009T13	In the meantime, New Zealand Prime Minister Helen Clark said it was "extraordinary" that Qarase was being accused of treason following allegations he asked for Australian and New Zealand forces to help him fight the military takeover.
20796	XIN_ENG_20070313.0139.LDC2009T13	Clark said Monday it was abundantly clear from the report that no one, except those who had seized power in Fiji, thought what had happened was anything but "unconstitutional and illegal."

20805	XIN_ENG_20070320.0047.LDC2009T13	"The remainder has to be left idle."
20806	XIN_ENG_20070320.0047.LDC2009T13	The water shortage has also affected power generation at Daguangba and Niululing hydropower stations, two main power producers on the island.

20817	XIN_ENG_20070320.0092.LDC2009T13	The government notice also required that school-owned Internet bars must be directly managed by the school, operated on a not- for-profit basis and must not be leased to individuals.

20852	XIN_ENG_20070406.0236.LDC2009T13	WASHINGTON, April 6 (Xinhua)
20853	XIN_ENG_20070406.0236.LDC2009T13	The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on Friday announced the approval of HepaGam B for the prevention of hepatitis B reinfection in certain liver transplant patients.
20854	XIN_ENG_20070406.0236.LDC2009T13	HepaGam B is the first product of its kind (an immune globulin product) approved for this purpose.
20855	XIN_ENG_20070406.0236.LDC2009T13	Hepatitis B is a serious disease caused by a virus that attacks the liver and can cause lifelong infection, liver cancer, liver failure and death.
20856	XIN_ENG_20070406.0236.LDC2009T13	Liver transplant patients who have already been exposed to the hepatitis B virus (HBV) are at an increased risk of reinfection because they have weakened immune systems.
20857	XIN_ENG_20070406.0236.LDC2009T13	"This approval provides a new treatment option for the reduction of hepatitis B recurrence in liver transplant patients with a prior history of this serious disease," said Jesse Goodman, director of FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research. "
20858	XIN_ENG_20070406.0236.LDC2009T13	It is the first immune globulin product -- one of several classes of proteins derived from human plasma -- approved for this use."
20859	XIN_ENG_20070406.0236.LDC2009T13	HepaGam B works by providing an immediate immune response to the virus.
20860	XIN_ENG_20070406.0236.LDC2009T13	This immunity protects patients previously exposed to HBV.
20861	XIN_ENG_20070406.0236.LDC2009T13	Patients must receive injections at the time of their liver transplant and throughout their lives.
20862	XIN_ENG_20070406.0236.LDC2009T13	This product is manufactured from human plasma collected at U.S. licensed plasma centers from healthy donors.
20863	XIN_ENG_20070406.0236.LDC2009T13	FDA based its approval on the company's clinical data in a study of HBV-infected persons undergoing full liver transplants, which showed a reduction in the virus recurrence rate from 86 percent to about 13 percent.
20864	XIN_ENG_20070406.0236.LDC2009T13	Adverse reactions were similar to other immune globulin products for other indications and included headache and hypertension.
20865	XIN_ENG_20070406.0236.LDC2009T13	In January 2006, FDA licensed HepaGam B to prevent infection with HBV for the following other purposes: after acute exposure to blood or certain body fluids containing HBV

20977	XIN_ENG_20070805.0044.LDC2009T13	According to a statement of the local governor's office, the PKK rebels, who came to Cepkenli village of Gurpinar town two days ago, killed 55-year-old Ikram Oner when he refused to give food and supply to them.
20978	XIN_ENG_20070805.0044.LDC2009T13	Operations are under way to capture the Kurdish rebels who fled after the incident, the report said.
20979	XIN_ENG_20070805.0044.LDC2009T13	Meanwhile, four soldiers were wounded in a clash with PKK members in Siran town of the Black Sea province of Gumushane on Saturday, the report said.
20980	XIN_ENG_20070805.0044.LDC2009T13	The wounded have been taken to Siran State Hospital for treatment, it added.
20981	XIN_ENG_20070805.0044.LDC2009T13	The PKK has increased attacks on Turkish troops in southeastern Turkey in recent months that led to Turkey's mounting intention of an incursion into northern Iraq to crush the PKK.
20982	XIN_ENG_20070805.0044.LDC2009T13	The PKK launched an armed campaign for an ethnic homeland in the mainly Kurdish southeastern Turkey in 1984, sparking decades of strife that has claimed more than 30,000 lives.

20985	XIN_ENG_20070807.0328.LDC2009T13	JOHANNESBURG, August 7 (Xinhua)
20986	XIN_ENG_20070807.0328.LDC2009T13	World soccer governing body FIFA and South Africa on Tuesday agreed to internationally use a dual-name system for three 2010 World Cup host cities in the country.
20987	XIN_ENG_20070807.0328.LDC2009T13	This compromise was reached amid South Africa's controversial name-changing campaigns, with objectors warning that new names of the host cities could cause unnecessary confusion internationally.
20988	XIN_ENG_20070807.0328.LDC2009T13	FIFA and the 2010 Local Organizing Committee (LOC) agreed that the three host cities would be internationally known as Pretoria/Tshwane, Bloemfontein/Mangaung and Port Elizabeth/Nelson Mandela Bay, state broadcaster SABC reported on Tuesday.
20989	XIN_ENG_20070807.0328.LDC2009T13	The double-barrel names will also be printed on the tickets of the 2010 matches, according to the decision made after the monthly 2010 board meeting in Johannesburg.
20990	XIN_ENG_20070807.0328.LDC2009T13	But within South Africa, the cities will only be known as Tshwane, Mangaung and the Nelson Mandela Bay municipality, SABC said.
20991	XIN_ENG_20070807.0328.LDC2009T13	Decision has yet been made on whether Nelspruit, another host city, will be called Mbombela.
20992	XIN_ENG_20070807.0328.LDC2009T13	South Africa's black government has for years advocated the campaign to change names of hundreds of streets and cities, which were considered as legacies of the country's colonial past.
20993	XIN_ENG_20070807.0328.LDC2009T13	Pretoria, the South African capital that was named after Boer settler and Afrikaner hero Andries Pretorius, has been proposed to be renamed Tshwane, the name of a pre-colonial local chief, which means "we are the same".
20994	XIN_ENG_20070807.0328.LDC2009T13	Supporters of the change say the switch will underscore South Africa's break with apartheid in 1994.
20995	XIN_ENG_20070807.0328.LDC2009T13	But objectors, predominantly white people of Afrikaner origin, said they had a feeling of being alienated in new South Africa, and many feel that the enormous cost of the name change would be better spent dealing with the country's high poverty rates and current AIDS crisis.
20996	XIN_ENG_20070807.0328.LDC2009T13	The government has made it clear that the name change plan retains " Pretoria" as part of the bigger Tshwane municipality.
20997	XIN_ENG_20070807.0328.LDC2009T13	Although many South African governmental organs and a few media, including SABC, have started to refer Tshwane as the South African capital, large amount of media, businesses and institutions both in South Africa and internationally still use Pretoria as the city's name.
20998	XIN_ENG_20070807.0328.LDC2009T13	Last week, City of Tshwane spokesman Console Tleane confirmed plans to change road signs from "Pretoria" to "Tshwane" or "City of Tshwane".

21001	XIN_ENG_20070808.0243.LDC2009T13	On the last day of July, just days before the 40th Anniversary of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), foreign ministers from the 10 ASEAN member countries and China, Japan and South Korea (10+3) gathered in Manila of the Philippines to discuss issues including economy, politics and security.
21002	XIN_ENG_20070808.0243.LDC2009T13	Leaders and high ranking officials of 10+3 sitting together to have meetings was incogitable for most of people a decade ago.
21003	XIN_ENG_20070808.0243.LDC2009T13	But now all the politicians and observers have noticed that the relationship of partners within 10+3 is unprecedented close and comprehensive today.
21004	XIN_ENG_20070808.0243.LDC2009T13	On Dec. 15, 1997 in Malaysia, leaders of ASEAN's member countries and China, Japan and South Korea historically gathered together to discuss the future of East Asia, cheering the establishment of 10+3 framework.
21005	XIN_ENG_20070808.0243.LDC2009T13	As two of the most economic energetic regions in the world, the cooperation between Southeast Asia and Northeast Asia mainly focused in the fields of trade and economy at the first phase, and reached a prodigious success soon.
21006	XIN_ENG_20070808.0243.LDC2009T13	Take China-ASEAN trade as an example, in the past decade, the two-way trade volume has increased yearly about 20 percent.
21007	XIN_ENG_20070808.0243.LDC2009T13	According to statistics of China's Ministry of Commerce, it reached to 160.8 billion U.S. dollars in 2006, and the figure is expected to surpass 180 billion U.S. dollars this year.
21008	XIN_ENG_20070808.0243.LDC2009T13	Now China is the fourth biggest trade partner of ASEAN, and ASEAN the fifth of China.
21009	XIN_ENG_20070808.0243.LDC2009T13	In 2002, China became the first country to sign agreement with ASEAN on building Free Trade Area (FTA), which will be completed by 2010.
21010	XIN_ENG_20070808.0243.LDC2009T13	In the past five years, taxes of about 7,000 kinds of goods has lowered down, scale of mutually direct investment went on bulge, China-ASEAN Expo which held in China's Nanning every year since 2004 has become an important stage for bilateral trade and communications.
21011	XIN_ENG_20070808.0243.LDC2009T13	People of both sides have benefited a lot in the FTA.
21012	XIN_ENG_20070808.0243.LDC2009T13	South Korea and Japan also do not want to lag behind in term of 10+3 cooperation.
21013	XIN_ENG_20070808.0243.LDC2009T13	A free-trade deal covering merchandise between South Korea and ASEAN, excluding Thailand, came into force on June 1.
21014	XIN_ENG_20070808.0243.LDC2009T13	Negotiations covering services and investment will end by the end of this year.
21015	XIN_ENG_20070808.0243.LDC2009T13	The trade volume of South Korea and ASEAN reached 53.5 billion U.S. dollars, account for one tenth of South Korea's total trade, in the year 2005.
21016	XIN_ENG_20070808.0243.LDC2009T13	Investment of 12.5 billion U.S. dollars from South Korea flew to ASEAN in 2006.
21017	XIN_ENG_20070808.0243.LDC2009T13	Although Japan has not signed free trade deal with ASEAN, it has been one of the countries that invest most in ASEAN members in the past 30 years.
21018	XIN_ENG_20070808.0243.LDC2009T13	In a healthy competition of the three countries so far to boost trade and investment in ASEAN, economic integration in East Asia becomes foreseeable.
21019	XIN_ENG_20070808.0243.LDC2009T13	As the cooperation is deepening and broadening, the concerned topics of 10+3 gradually expand to politics, security, culture and other fields.
21020	XIN_ENG_20070808.0243.LDC2009T13	Under the framework, minister-level meeting system in the diplomatic, financial, economic, agricultural, tourism and labor fields has built up and run healthily.

21022	XIN_ENG_20070808.0243.LDC2009T13	At Manila, the ministers urged to draft the 2nd Joint Statement on East Asia Cooperation to round up the accomplishments, because the 10+3 framework compiled in 1999 had not covered with all aspects of cooperation.
21023	XIN_ENG_20070808.0243.LDC2009T13	As another strong signal, the ministers also discussed regional hot issues such as the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula.
21024	XIN_ENG_20070808.0243.LDC2009T13	It shows that the 10+3 nations have the common interest in keeping peace and stability in the region and the world.
21025	XIN_ENG_20070808.0243.LDC2009T13	After establishment, 10+3 persist on supporting ASEAN to play an important role in framework like East Asia Summit (EAS), ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF), Asia Cooperation Dialogue (ACD), Asian- Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC), Asia- Europe Meeting (ASEM) and integration of East Asia.
21026	XIN_ENG_20070808.0243.LDC2009T13	However, East Asia, with huge diversities in religions, ideology and culture background, disputes left behind by history and great imbalance in levels of economy and society development, it is still a long way for a final integration.
21027	XIN_ENG_20070808.0243.LDC2009T13	"Economic development in our region is still unbalanced and some countries still lag behind in economic and social development, " Chinese foreign minister Yang Jiechi said to his counterparts in Manila, "The overall competitiveness of East Asia needs to be enhanced."
21028	XIN_ENG_20070808.0243.LDC2009T13	No matter how, the 10+3 has become a win-win road for integration of East Asia, and more important, as leaders stressed in Manila that the 10+3 is one of the most important cooperation frameworks in the region and the main tool in the long-term goal of establishing an East Asian Community.

21050	XIN_ENG_20070822.0160.LDC2009T13	The health authorities attributed the increased number of dengue fever cases so far this year to early onset of monsoon, torrential rain and widespread flood in the country.

21093	XIN_ENG_20070922.0188.LDC2009T13	Firas Moulla, a former world-class long-distance swimmer, thus became the first person in the world to swim across the waters between Europe and Asia in the Mediterranean, who would in turn enter the Guinness Book of World Records.
21094	XIN_ENG_20070922.0188.LDC2009T13	Moulla, 36, began his long journey Thursday evening from the north point of Cyprus, Cape Andreas, and arrived at Lattakia Saturday morning.
21095	XIN_ENG_20070922.0188.LDC2009T13	He was scheduled to go a distance of 110 km, but the currents forced him to swim 14 km more, making the total course at 124 km.
21096	XIN_ENG_20070922.0188.LDC2009T13	"This is the most difficult attempt in my swimming career which was completed 3 years after my retirement, and it will be a perfect curtain call for my sports life," Moulla told reporters after he was landed.
21097	XIN_ENG_20070922.0188.LDC2009T13	Moulla, who has been training for a year and a half in preparation for his latest challenge, failed in his first attempt on Sept. 11 after the navigating ships deviated from the original course to the direction of Turkey.
21098	XIN_ENG_20070922.0188.LDC2009T13	He had to abandon his plan after swimming 36 km at that time.
21099	XIN_ENG_20070922.0188.LDC2009T13	Moulla, the Asian long-distance swimming champion in 2002, had dominated the inter-Arab long-distance swimming championships during 1991-2003.
21100	XIN_ENG_20070922.0188.LDC2009T13	He also won the fourth place in the world swimming championship in 1998 in Japan and performed strongly in world championships in Canada, Argentina and Croatia.
21101	XIN_ENG_20070922.0188.LDC2009T13	Moulla, currently Chairman of the Asian Long-distance Swimming Association and Vice Chairman both of the Syrian Sports Association and the Syrian Olympic Committee, had previously swum the English Channel between Dover and Callais.

21104	XIN_ENG_20070928.0097.LDC2009T13	Russian First Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev expressed congratulations on the Chinese national day, saying that his country values friendship and cooperation with China and will further strengthen bilateral relations.
21105	XIN_ENG_20070928.0097.LDC2009T13	Medvedev made the remarks Thursday evening at the reception of the Chinese national day held by the Chinese embassy in Moscow.
21106	XIN_ENG_20070928.0097.LDC2009T13	China has achieved enormous achievements in the fields of socio- economy, science, technology and culture, and held an important position in the international arena since it was founded on Oct. 1, 1949, he said.
21107	XIN_ENG_20070928.0097.LDC2009T13	The Russia-China relations have currently attained to a new level on the basis of mutual respect and mutual trust, which indicates great potentials to further such cooperation, Medvedev said.
21108	XIN_ENG_20070928.0097.LDC2009T13	He stressed that the theme years held in China and Russia increase bilateral exchanges and promote pragmatic cooperation in many fields, strengthening mutual understanding of the peoples of the two countries.
21109	XIN_ENG_20070928.0097.LDC2009T13	Chinese Ambassador to Russia Liu Guchang lauded the Sino-Russian relations, which he said are in the best period for a full-scale and rapid development.
21110	XIN_ENG_20070928.0097.LDC2009T13	The activities conducted under the framework of the theme years make the peoples of the two nations closer to each other and help forge a closer cooperation in various areas, Liu said.

21112	XIN_ENG_20071012.0258.LDC2009T13	BERLIN, Oct. 12 (Xinhua)
21113	XIN_ENG_20071012.0258.LDC2009T13	German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Friday met with Polish President Lech Kaczynski over a disputed European Union treaty draft a week before the upcoming EU summit.
21114	XIN_ENG_20071012.0258.LDC2009T13	Kaczynski told reporters before the meeting in Berlin that " there are still details to smooth out, details which in one or two cases are fairly important."
21115	XIN_ENG_20071012.0258.LDC2009T13	Still, the president said he was "optimistic" that an agreement could be reached during the summit in Lisbon on Oct. 18.
21116	XIN_ENG_20071012.0258.LDC2009T13	Merkel said she was ready to clear up the remaining issues with the Polish president so that the 27 EU members could ratify the treaty draft in the Lisbon meeting as planned.
21117	XIN_ENG_20071012.0258.LDC2009T13	At the EU summit in June, EU leaders signed an agreement on hammering out the final text for a new treaty to reform the EU's institutions, ending a two-year stalemate after France and the Netherlands rejected the previously proposed constitution in referendums.
21118	XIN_ENG_20071012.0258.LDC2009T13	Poland had managed to persuade EU partners to delay the implementation of a new voting system which some EU nations fear will give too much power to bigger states.

21120	XIN_ENG_20071017.0353.LDC2009T13	KHARTOUM, Oct. 17 (Xinhua)
21121	XIN_ENG_20071017.0353.LDC2009T13	Egypt reiterated on Wednesday its concern over the crisis in the Sudanese government aroused by the former southern rebel movement's suspension of its participation in the government.
21122	XIN_ENG_20071017.0353.LDC2009T13	During a visit to Sudan Wednesday, an Egyptian delegation led by Foreign Minister Ahmed Aboul Gheit and intelligence chief Omar Suleiman delivered a message by President Hosni Mubarak to Sudanese President Omer al-Bashir.
21123	XIN_ENG_20071017.0353.LDC2009T13	"The message of President Mubarak reflects his concern and that of Egypt and its people with the affairs of Sudan and its desire and hope for strong and united Sudan," the Egyptian foreign minister told reporters at the end of a meeting with al-Bashir.
21124	XIN_ENG_20071017.0353.LDC2009T13	He said that the message also dealt with the bilateral relations between the two countries as well as the stances of Egypt and its concern with realization of peace and stability in Sudan.
21125	XIN_ENG_20071017.0353.LDC2009T13	The meeting at the Presidential Guest House in Khartoum followed a short visit of the Egyptian delegation to Juba, the capital of southern Sudan, where they held talks with Sudanese First Vice President and Chairman of the former rebel Sudan People 's Liberation Movement (SPLM) Salva Kiir Mayardit and other senior SPLM officials.
21126	XIN_ENG_20071017.0353.LDC2009T13	After the meetings in both Khartoum and Juba, the Egyptian foreign minister said that they were greatly encouraged as "they feel the two sides, the SPLM and the National Congress Party (NCP), are working to maintain contacts and full implementation of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA)."
21127	XIN_ENG_20071017.0353.LDC2009T13	NCP is the ruling Sudanese political party led by al-Bashir, who signed the CPA with the SPLM in 2005 to end a 21-year conflict between them, which has constituted the longest civil war in the African continent.
21128	XIN_ENG_20071017.0353.LDC2009T13	On Thursday, SPLM decided to withhold the participation of the movement's ministers in the central government and freeze the partnership between the SPLM and the NCP until pending issues between them were settled.
21129	XIN_ENG_20071017.0353.LDC2009T13	This is the most serious political crisis for the Sudanese government of national unity since it was established in September, 2005, in which the political power is shared between the SPLM and the NCP.

21131	XIN_ENG_20071017.0451.LDC2009T13	RIO DE JANEIRO, Oct. 17 (Xinhua)
21132	XIN_ENG_20071017.0451.LDC2009T13	Thirty hostages, including 16 children, taken captive during a prison riot in Maranhao state, northeastern Brazil, were released Wednesday.
21133	XIN_ENG_20071017.0451.LDC2009T13	The hostages had been held for nearly 24 hours.
21134	XIN_ENG_20071017.0451.LDC2009T13	The inmates involved in the riot also surrendered to the police and handed over a firearm they had used during the incident.
21135	XIN_ENG_20071017.0451.LDC2009T13	The prisoners backed down following negotiations with the police and Charlene Ribeiro, wife of Bruno Monteiro da Silva, leader of the riot.
21136	XIN_ENG_20071017.0451.LDC2009T13	The inmates agreed to surrender after the center's administrative director signed a document promising not to torture any of the rioters.
21137	XIN_ENG_20071017.0451.LDC2009T13	The riot broke out when Da Silva started shooting while penitentiary agents were distributing snacks to the inmates' children.
21138	XIN_ENG_20071017.0451.LDC2009T13	The children were visiting the inmate center to attend a party celebrating Children's Day.
21139	XIN_ENG_20071017.0451.LDC2009T13	Four people were injured, including two agents.
21140	XIN_ENG_20071017.0451.LDC2009T13	During the negotiations, the inmates also requested the transfer of Da Silva, charged with provoking the riot, to another inmate center.
21141	XIN_ENG_20071017.0451.LDC2009T13	Maranhao's Secretariat of Public Security said it will investigate how the firearm was taken into the prison.
21142	XIN_ENG_20071017.0451.LDC2009T13	This was the third prison riot this month in Sao Luis, the state's capital city.
21143	XIN_ENG_20071017.0453.LDC2009T13	Roundup: EU seeks to clinch deal on institutional reform
21144	XIN_ENG_20071017.0453.LDC2009T13	LISBON, Oct. 17 (Xinhua)
21145	XIN_ENG_20071017.0453.LDC2009T13	European Union (EU) leaders meet in Lisbon on Thursday and Friday to try to agree on the text of a draft treaty after years of debate over institutional reform of the 27-nation bloc.
21146	XIN_ENG_20071017.0453.LDC2009T13	At the informal summit, hosted annually by the incumbent EU president in autumn, national leaders will look at the Reform Treaty prepared by the intergovernmental conference (IGC) according to the guidelines set out by the leaders after a marathon meeting in June.
21147	XIN_ENG_20071017.0453.LDC2009T13	The treaty will replace the controversial Constitutional Treaty, which was signed by EU states in 2004 but was permanently frozen after French and Dutch voters gave it a thumbs-down in 2005.
21148	XIN_ENG_20071017.0453.LDC2009T13	The new treaty, hammered out by EU legal experts earlier this month, is expected to make the EU's decision-making mechanism more efficient yet more democratic, and to accelerate integration in Europe.
21149	XIN_ENG_20071017.0453.LDC2009T13	The EU's successive enlargements in recent years have made the body increasingly difficult to run smoothly.
21150	XIN_ENG_20071017.0453.LDC2009T13	TIME TO MOVE ON
21151	XIN_ENG_20071017.0453.LDC2009T13	"We need the EU to speak with the single strong voice to deliver global leadership.
21152	XIN_ENG_20071017.0453.LDC2009T13	We need more efficient and democratic decision-making to deliver policy results that benefit our citizens," Jose Manuel Barroso, president of the European Commission, the executive arm of the EU, said Wednesday.
21153	XIN_ENG_20071017.0453.LDC2009T13	"We need to put this institutional debate behind us.
21154	XIN_ENG_20071017.0453.LDC2009T13	We have spent six years discussing the institutional architecture.
21155	XIN_ENG_20071017.0453.LDC2009T13	It is time to move on," he said.
21156	XIN_ENG_20071017.0453.LDC2009T13	After two years of reviewing the fate of the EU constitution, and months of intense negotiations among member states since the beginning of this year, Barroso believes the current draft treaty "is the best deal that is on offer."
21157	XIN_ENG_20071017.0453.LDC2009T13	"There are no reasons, no excuses not to solve this issue this week," he said.
21158	XIN_ENG_20071017.0453.LDC2009T13	TREATY REVISED
21159	XIN_ENG_20071017.0453.LDC2009T13	Unlike the constitution, which was meant to replace all earlier EU treaties and start afresh, the Reform Treaty is designed to amend the Treaty on the European Union (the Maastricht Treaty) and the Treaty Establishing the European Community (the Rome Treaty).
21160	XIN_ENG_20071017.0453.LDC2009T13	It also scraps all reference to EU symbols - the flag, the anthem and the motto, and shies away from any phrase which smacks of "a European Superstate."
21161	XIN_ENG_20071017.0453.LDC2009T13	Hence the title "constitution," which is loathed by many skeptical EU citizens, is dropped.
21162	XIN_ENG_20071017.0453.LDC2009T13	However, the new treaty retains many of the changes the constitution attempted to introduce.
21163	XIN_ENG_20071017.0453.LDC2009T13	They include:
21164	XIN_ENG_20071017.0453.LDC2009T13	- a president of the European council who would serve a two-and-a half-year term.
21165	XIN_ENG_20071017.0453.LDC2009T13	This would replace the current system of a rolling six-month presidency
21166	XIN_ENG_20071017.0453.LDC2009T13	- an EU higher representative for foreign and security policy.
21167	XIN_ENG_20071017.0453.LDC2009T13	This would combine the jobs of foreign affairs chief Javier Solana and External Affairs Commissioner Benita Ferrero-Waldner
21168	XIN_ENG_20071017.0453.LDC2009T13	- reducing the size of the European Commission, from 27 commissioners to 18, from 2014
21169	XIN_ENG_20071017.0453.LDC2009T13	- introducing double majority rule for Council decisions in 2014: proposed EU legislation requiring a qualified majority needs to muster the support of 55 percent of member states and of 65 percent of the EU's population.
21170	XIN_ENG_20071017.0453.LDC2009T13	But, in a concession to Poland, member states will be able to invoke the old system until 2017
21171	XIN_ENG_20071017.0453.LDC2009T13	- a redistribution of voting weights between the member states, phased in between 2014 and 2017
21172	XIN_ENG_20071017.0453.LDC2009T13	- new powers for the European commission, European parliament and European court of justice, in areas such as justice and home affairs
21173	XIN_ENG_20071017.0453.LDC2009T13	- the removal of the national veto in a number of policy areas.
21174	XIN_ENG_20071017.0453.LDC2009T13	Put simply, the new treaty is widely seen as having preserved the main substance of the constitution.
21175	XIN_ENG_20071017.0453.LDC2009T13	STICKING POINTS
21176	XIN_ENG_20071017.0453.LDC2009T13	Squabbling over the new treaty never seems to end.
21177	XIN_ENG_20071017.0453.LDC2009T13	Poland, Britain, Italy and Austria are among those member states which have their own issues.
21178	XIN_ENG_20071017.0453.LDC2009T13	Poland, which holds elections on Oct. 21, wants a future EU voting mechanism that would allow EU decisions to be frozen temporarily when a minority of member nations disagree.
21179	XIN_ENG_20071017.0453.LDC2009T13	Poland, which claims that the new treaty would give bigger member states more leverage than before, said the decision-blocking mechanism, or the Ioannina clause, should be written into the treaty.
21180	XIN_ENG_20071017.0453.LDC2009T13	Until now it is written in a declaration which has no legal standing.
21181	XIN_ENG_20071017.0453.LDC2009T13	London negotiated complex opt-outs on police and judicial cooperation and from the Charter of Fundamental Rights.
21182	XIN_ENG_20071017.0453.LDC2009T13	Poland also chose not to be bound by the Charter of Fundamental Rights.
21183	XIN_ENG_20071017.0453.LDC2009T13	Italy disputes a decision on how EU parliamentary seats should be distributed.
21184	XIN_ENG_20071017.0453.LDC2009T13	According to the new rules, Rome's seats should be cut from 78 to 72 in 2009, the biggest drop among member states.
21185	XIN_ENG_20071017.0453.LDC2009T13	Austria, which complains about a big influx of German students in its medical schools, demands certain limits on the number of foreign students who could be enrolled in its universities.
21186	XIN_ENG_20071017.0453.LDC2009T13	FATE OF TREATY UNKNOWN
21187	XIN_ENG_20071017.0453.LDC2009T13	Although there are still points to settle, some EU officials are optimistic about the prospect of a successful summit.
21188	XIN_ENG_20071017.0453.LDC2009T13	French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner said Monday that all the differences among member states are minor and EU leaders will conclude the meeting within 30 minutes.
21189	XIN_ENG_20071017.0453.LDC2009T13	But others are more cautious.
21190	XIN_ENG_20071017.0453.LDC2009T13	They say that it is not uncommon for member states to raise new demands in the eleventh hour and capsize the boat.
21191	XIN_ENG_20071017.0453.LDC2009T13	Even if the draft is approved at this meeting, the Reform Treaty will not be signed right away, said Portugal, which holds the EU presidency.
21192	XIN_ENG_20071017.0453.LDC2009T13	The informal meeting is just an opportunity for heads of state to see the results of legal work carried out on the treaty over the autumn.
21193	XIN_ENG_20071017.0453.LDC2009T13	Hopefully, it will be signed by member states at the formal summit in Brussels in December.
21194	XIN_ENG_20071017.0453.LDC2009T13	After that, the treaty need to be ratified by each of the 27 member states before it becomes a legally binding document.
21195	XIN_ENG_20071017.0453.LDC2009T13	EU leaders want the treaty in place ahead of next European Parliament elections scheduled for 2009.
21196	XIN_ENG_20071018.0319.LDC2009T13	South Africa to tighten security of shopping centers
21197	XIN_ENG_20071018.0319.LDC2009T13	JOHANNESBURG, Oct. 18 (Xinhua)
21198	XIN_ENG_20071018.0319.LDC2009T13	South African shopping centers across the country are going to tighten security as the annual major festival is approaching, Business Against Crime (BAC) said here on Thursday.
21199	XIN_ENG_20071018.0319.LDC2009T13	Addressing a media conference, BAC's Jenni Irish-Qhobosheane said the prevalence of violent crimes in shopping centers was of serious concerns for the government, the business sector and the law abiding citizens of the country.
21200	XIN_ENG_20071018.0319.LDC2009T13	South African police said that there are a sharp increase in violent crimes in the country as Christmas is approaching.
21201	XIN_ENG_20071018.0319.LDC2009T13	December is the most dangerous season in the year with dramatic growth in armed robberies.
21202	XIN_ENG_20071018.0319.LDC2009T13	She said this led to an establishment of a shopping center security initiative, which is a partnership between the South Africa Council of Shopping Centers, South African Property Owners, the Consumer Goods Council of South Africa, and the BAC.
21203	XIN_ENG_20071018.0319.LDC2009T13	"The initiative provides an early warning system which assists centers to identify their immediate risk," she added.
21204	XIN_ENG_20071018.0319.LDC2009T13	Irish-Qhobosheane said the BAC was working with the SA Police Service to provide center management with information on latest trends regarding violent crime.
21205	XIN_ENG_20071018.0319.LDC2009T13	"Our focus is more on how to prevent the occurrence of the violent crimes than to deal with them."
21206	XIN_ENG_20071018.0319.LDC2009T13	Since the establishment of the initiative late last year, there had been a 30 percent decrease in violent shopping center crimes.
21207	XIN_ENG_20071018.0319.LDC2009T13	The initiative was initially funded by Liberty Life Properties and Pareto, but since its inception several major property owners and managing companies had participated, Irish-Qhobosheane said.

21209	XIN_ENG_20071022.0285.LDC2009T13	NEW YORK, Oct. 22 (Xinhua)
21210	XIN_ENG_20071022.0285.LDC2009T13	Bear Stearns, the U.S. investment bank battered by slumping mortgage markets, and China's CITIC Securities have agreed to swap stakes in each other and form a broad alliance, the firms said on Monday.
21211	XIN_ENG_20071022.0285.LDC2009T13	The deal would bolster access to business in booming China for Bear, which lags bigger Wall Street rivals in expanding its business beyond the United States, according to a CNBC website report.
21212	XIN_ENG_20071022.0285.LDC2009T13	Under the preliminary agreement, CITIC would invest about 1 billion U.S. dollars in Bear Stearns securities that would convert into about 6 percent of the New York-based investment bank.
21213	XIN_ENG_20071022.0285.LDC2009T13	Bear Stearns would buy 1 billion dollars of CITIC debt that would over time amount to a 2 percent stake in the Beijing-based firm.
21214	XIN_ENG_20071022.0285.LDC2009T13	Neither company could hold more than 9.9 percent of the other's stock.

21218	XIN_ENG_20071031.0021.LDC2009T13	"The international reserves are in a comfort level at the meantime," Bank Indonesia deputy governor Miranda Goeltom said here.
21219	XIN_ENG_20071031.0021.LDC2009T13	The rupiah has gained 0.6 percent against the dollar so far this year, she said.
21220	XIN_ENG_20071031.0021.LDC2009T13	"The gain supported our balance of payment and in a short-term created a bigger surplus."

21223	XIN_ENG_20071031.0246.LDC2009T13	Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapakse decided to revoke with immediate effect a gazette notification issued earlier on Wednesday imposing a military news censorship, a top official said Wednesday.
21224	XIN_ENG_20071031.0246.LDC2009T13	"The president has decided to revoke the gazette.
21225	XIN_ENG_20071031.0246.LDC2009T13	He expects the media to act responsibly," Chandrapala Liyanage, the president 's director general for media said.
21226	XIN_ENG_20071031.0246.LDC2009T13	The government gazette bearing number 1521/3 dated Oct. 29 was issued Wednesday barring the media from disseminating information on military operations or information with regard to the procurement of military equipment.
21227	XIN_ENG_20071031.0246.LDC2009T13	The violating editors were to be subject to a jail term not less than three years in addition to being imposed fines.
21228	XIN_ENG_20071031.0246.LDC2009T13	"The president later decided that existing laws are enough to deal with anyone who acts irresponsibly so there is no need for a censorship," Liyanage said.
21229	XIN_ENG_20071031.0246.LDC2009T13	The gazette came to be issued as the government last week withdrew broadcasting licenses of five radio channels for irresponsible dissemination of incorrect information.
21230	XIN_ENG_20071031.0246.LDC2009T13	The government had a similar news censorship during 2000-2001 period at the height of a military campaign against the rebel Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE).
21231	XIN_ENG_20071031.0246.LDC2009T13	Conflict between government troops and the LTTE has been escalating since the end of 2005, making the Norwegian brokered peace agreement exist only on paper.
21232	XIN_ENG_20071031.0246.LDC2009T13	Claiming discrimination at the hands of the Sinhala majority, the LTTE has been fighting the government since the mid-1980s to establish a separate homeland for the minority Tamils in the north and east.

21235	XIN_ENG_20071031.0320.LDC2009T13	Spain's Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero said on Wednesday that the harsh sentences dictated on Wednesday for the March 11 of 2004 terrorist attacks have made justice and established "the truth of the facts."
21236	XIN_ENG_20071031.0320.LDC2009T13	Zapatero recalled the victims on behalf of all Spaniards and expressed his closeness with the families that lost one of their loved ones that day.
21237	XIN_ENG_20071031.0320.LDC2009T13	Spain's National Court, the highest court in this European country, sentenced two Moroccans convicted as the authors of the attacks to 40,000 years in prison, and sentenced a Spaniard to 35, 000 years for facilitating the explosives.
21238	XIN_ENG_20071031.0320.LDC2009T13	Two other people implicated in the crime received sentences of 15 and 12 years, while eight of the accused were acquitted.
21239	XIN_ENG_20071031.0320.LDC2009T13	Zapatero expressed his confidence that the sentences will grant comfort and relieve to those who lost a loved one that day, although nobody will be able to restore their loss.
21240	XIN_ENG_20071031.0320.LDC2009T13	The trial established "the truth of the facts" and the responsibility of the authors, he said.
21241	XIN_ENG_20071031.0320.LDC2009T13	The sentence is the best lesson so that all parties commit themselves to unity against terrorism, he added said.
21242	XIN_ENG_20071031.0320.LDC2009T13	In the worse terrorist day in Spain's history, the almost simultaneous train bombings in Madrid left at least 191 killed and 1,800 injured on March 11 of 2004.

21257	XIN_ENG_20071107.0307.LDC2009T13	U.S. commercial crude oil inventories fell last week, the third consecutive weekly decline, while gasoline supplies also decreased, the Energy Department reported Wednesday in its weekly survey.
21258	XIN_ENG_20071107.0307.LDC2009T13	In the week ended Nov. 2, the nation's commercial crude oil inventories dropped by 800,000 barrels to 311.9 million.
21259	XIN_ENG_20071107.0307.LDC2009T13	But the drop was half the 1.6 million barrel decline analysts were expecting.
21260	XIN_ENG_20071107.0307.LDC2009T13	Gasoline stockpiles also fell 800,000 barrels last week to 194.
21261	XIN_ENG_20071107.0307.LDC2009T13	3 million.
21262	XIN_ENG_20071107.0307.LDC2009T13	Analysts, however, had been forecasting gasoline supplies to grow by 200,000 barrels.
21263	XIN_ENG_20071107.0307.LDC2009T13	Meanwhile, supplies of distillates, which include heating oil and diesel fuel, rose by 100,000 barrels last week to 135.4 million, defying a decline of 500,000 barrels expected by analysts.
21264	XIN_ENG_20071107.0307.LDC2009T13	The report also showed that U.S. refinery utilization remained flat last week at 86.2 percent of capacity.
21265	XIN_ENG_20071107.0307.LDC2009T13	Analysts had expected an increase of 0.8 percentage point.

21270	XIN_ENG_20071109.0327.LDC2009T13	KATHMANDU, Nov. 10 (Xinhua)
21271	XIN_ENG_20071109.0327.LDC2009T13	Garbage is piling up in the streets of Nepali capital city with the Katmandu Metropolitan City (KMC) stopping collection and management of garbage from Friday.
21272	XIN_ENG_20071109.0327.LDC2009T13	KMC officials said they were compelled to stop the collection of garbage as a protest against frequent obstructions created by the locals living around the landfill sites, a leading website, nepalnews.com reported on Saturday.
21273	XIN_ENG_20071109.0327.LDC2009T13	According to the report, they have demanded that the government make proper arrangements so that dumping of garbage could be done unhindered.
21274	XIN_ENG_20071109.0327.LDC2009T13	The KMC decision came after the locals of Sidol landfill site refused to allow its containers to enter the area.
21275	XIN_ENG_20071109.0327.LDC2009T13	The locals launched their protest in order to pressure the government to take action against a group of the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) members who beat up a local resident a few days earlier.
21276	XIN_ENG_20071109.0327.LDC2009T13	With the KMC officials announcing protest, rubbish is piling up on main roadsides and vegetable markets.

21279	XIN_ENG_20071120.0390.LDC2009T13	WASHINGTON, Nov. 20 (Xinhua)
21280	XIN_ENG_20071120.0390.LDC2009T13	The top U.S. general stressed Tuesday the need to keep the military option against Iran on table while adding that diplomacy is "really important."
21281	XIN_ENG_20071120.0390.LDC2009T13	"I'd never take the military option off the table," Michael Mullen, who chairs the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, told a group of foreign reporters in Washington.
21282	XIN_ENG_20071120.0390.LDC2009T13	However, "having the military option on the table doesn't mean it's going to get used," he went on.
21283	XIN_ENG_20071120.0390.LDC2009T13	"But it certainly is intended to ensure that there's no miscommunication or miscalculation
21284	XIN_ENG_20071120.0390.LDC2009T13	that the potential is there and the resolve is there though it is restrained at this point," Mullen added.
21285	XIN_ENG_20071120.0390.LDC2009T13	Meanwhile, he said, "I think that diplomacy is really important ... I think the diplomatic engagement is really important.
21286	XIN_ENG_20071120.0390.LDC2009T13	I am hopeful that talks will resume with them."
21287	XIN_ENG_20071120.0390.LDC2009T13	Mullen also expressed concerns over Iran's actions.
21288	XIN_ENG_20071120.0390.LDC2009T13	"Their actions and rhetoric have been destabilizing, not only in Iraq, but in the region.
21289	XIN_ENG_20071120.0390.LDC2009T13	And I think we'd all like to see Iran take a constructive and responsible role," he said.
21290	XIN_ENG_20071120.0390.LDC2009T13	Since Mullen became chairman on Oct. 1, he has expressed concern about Iran for several times.
21291	XIN_ENG_20071120.0390.LDC2009T13	He said last month that while military action against Iran is a last resort, the U.S. military has the resources to attack if needed despite the strains of wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.

21298	XIN_ENG_20071221.0231.LDC2009T13	The world's first cloned horse Prometea is pregnant, Italian animal-cloning pioneer Cesare Gallo confirmed during a telephone interview with Xinhua on Friday.
21299	XIN_ENG_20071221.0231.LDC2009T13	Galli, who worked at his reproduction technology farm near Italian northern city Cremona and produced Prometea in 2003, said the pregnancy showed that cloned animals were just as healthy as normal ones.
21300	XIN_ENG_20071221.0231.LDC2009T13	"Prometea will be the first cloned horse to give birth, around the beginning of April.
21301	XIN_ENG_20071221.0231.LDC2009T13	This is further confirmation that clones are completely normal if they are reared healthily," he said.
21302	XIN_ENG_20071221.0231.LDC2009T13	Cats, cows, bulls and mules have been among the animals cloned since the mother of them all, Dolly the sheep, was unveiled to acclaim and controversy in 1996.
21303	XIN_ENG_20071221.0231.LDC2009T13	Aside from ethical issues, opponents of cloning have raised concerns that some animals might have reduced quality of life.
21304	XIN_ENG_20071221.0231.LDC2009T13	It is claimed by some that Dolly aged quickly, dying in 2003 at the age of six and a half.
21305	XIN_ENG_20071221.0231.LDC2009T13	A cloned stallion called Pieraz, created in 2005, was also expecting his first offspring, according to Italian News Agency ANSA.
21306	XIN_ENG_20071221.0231.LDC2009T13	After Galli's pioneering work on horses in Italy, most of the world's horse cloning has moved to Texas.
21307	XIN_ENG_20071221.0231.LDC2009T13	So far about 10 horses have been cloned, including Prometea and Pieraz.

21310	XIN_ENG_20071226.0213.LDC2009T13	U.S. border authorities arrested just under 877,000 illegal crossers in fiscal 2007, which ended in September, down 20 percent compared with the year before, The Los Angeles Times reported Wednesday.
21311	XIN_ENG_20071226.0213.LDC2009T13	A drop in apprehensions is often interpreted as a sign that fewer migrants are attempting the trip, the paper said.
21312	XIN_ENG_20071226.0213.LDC2009T13	The growth rate of the U.S. Mexican-born population has dropped by nearly half to 4.2 percent in 2007 from about 8 percent in 2005 and 2006, the paper quoted an analysis of census data by the Pew Hispanic Center.
21313	XIN_ENG_20071226.0213.LDC2009T13	Employment of foreign-born Hispanics increased at a markedly slower pace in the first quarter of 2007 than during the same period in the previous three years, according to the report.
21314	XIN_ENG_20071226.0213.LDC2009T13	Growth in employment of foreign-born Hispanics in that sector was 10.9 percent early this year, compared with an average first- quarter growth rate of 19.8 percent from 2004 to 2006, said the report.
21315	XIN_ENG_20071226.0213.LDC2009T13	The growth in remittances sent to Mexico has dwindled to a trickle.
21316	XIN_ENG_20071226.0213.LDC2009T13	Through October of this year, Mexicans living abroad sent 20.4 billion U.S. dollars home to their families, a 1.3 percent increase over the same period in 2006, according to Mexico's central bank.
21317	XIN_ENG_20071226.0213.LDC2009T13	Those sums were growing in excess of 20 percent annually just a few years ago.
21318	XIN_ENG_20071226.0213.LDC2009T13	Authorities attributed the apparent decline to the slump in U.S. construction and the result of stepped-up enforcement.
21319	XIN_ENG_20071226.0213.LDC2009T13	U.S. construction has been a magnet for undocumented workers over the last few years -- one in five Latino immigrants works in the building trades.

21474	XIN_ENG_20080214.0317.LDC2009T13	The announcement came a day before a major rally in the capital 's Makati financial district by political opponents of Arroyo to demand her resignation over allegations of corruption linking the first family.
21475	XIN_ENG_20080214.0317.LDC2009T13	Reportedly, the rally is also a reason for Arroyo to cancel the trip.
21476	XIN_ENG_20080214.0317.LDC2009T13	Esperon said the military revealed the plot not to scare the people who may participate in the protest rally.

21481	XIN_ENG_20080215.0112.LDC2009T13	SHIJIAZHUANG, Feb. 15 (Xinhua)
21482	XIN_ENG_20080215.0112.LDC2009T13	The director of Hebei Province's quality inspection agency told reporters here on Friday that the two batches of dumplings involved in food poisoning case in Japan were unlikely to have been contaminated during the transportation process in China.
21483	XIN_ENG_20080215.0112.LDC2009T13	Investigations had shown that the dumplings were kept in the shipping container after they left the manufacturer, Tianyang Food Plant, and the inspection and quarantine authority of Hebei Province made sure that the door and seal of the container were intact when the shipment arrived at the customs facility, said director Cheng Fang.
21484	XIN_ENG_20080215.0112.LDC2009T13	The customs officials followed the rules, checked the documentation for the goods and let the container through without opening it, the official told a press conference.
21485	XIN_ENG_20080215.0112.LDC2009T13	Earlier this month, Japanese and Chinese investigators inspected the company but found nothing irregular.
21486	XIN_ENG_20080215.0112.LDC2009T13	They also found no problems related to the purchase of raw materials or the production process.
21487	XIN_ENG_20080215.0112.LDC2009T13	"The plant is very clean and well-managed, and no abnormality has been detected," a Japanese investigator told the press after the inspection.
21488	XIN_ENG_20080215.0112.LDC2009T13	He said Japan would conduct a further analysis based on data collected in the plant.
21489	XIN_ENG_20080215.0112.LDC2009T13	Di Menglu, head of Tianyang, said that there was little possibility of contamination during production.
21490	XIN_ENG_20080215.0112.LDC2009T13	Workers had to wear work clothes that covered them from head to toe and pass through two checkpoints before they could enter the production area, to ensure that they brought nothing in.
21491	XIN_ENG_20080215.0112.LDC2009T13	Cameras monitored the entire production line, and the large number of workers grouped in close conditions would make it difficult to do anything without detection, he said.
21492	XIN_ENG_20080215.0112.LDC2009T13	Production at the 800-worker factory had been suspended since the incident, and the recalled dumplings were kept in the cold storage, with seals from the inspection authority, he said.
21493	XIN_ENG_20080215.0112.LDC2009T13	"We suffered severe losses."
21494	XIN_ENG_20080215.0112.LDC2009T13	"With no work to do, we had to stay at home, waiting for the solution," said Yan Aiguo, a worker.
21495	XIN_ENG_20080215.0112.LDC2009T13	Tianyang Food Plant has been exporting to Japan for 10 years, and it sent 3,970 tonnes of dumplings to Japan last year.
21496	XIN_ENG_20080215.0112.LDC2009T13	Di quoted an announcement from the Japanese Ministry of Education dated Feb. 6, which said that other schools serving dumplings from the same batches did not report any poisoning cases.
21497	XIN_ENG_20080215.0112.LDC2009T13	Earlier tests showed the rest of the dumplings from the same batches sold in Japan, totaling more than 2,000 packages, were safe.
21498	XIN_ENG_20080215.0112.LDC2009T13	So were all the other products made by the Chinese company.
21499	XIN_ENG_20080215.0112.LDC2009T13	A Japanese local government official admitted on Thursday that a pesticide detected recently on the outside of the packaging of some Chinese-made dumplings was dichlorvos, which had been used in the store.
21500	XIN_ENG_20080215.0112.LDC2009T13	At a news conference, Tokushima Prefecture Governor Kamon Iizumi said that dichlorvos had also been detected on frozen food made in Japan and showcases at the store, but the amount had been too small to cause any injury, Kyodo News reported.
21501	XIN_ENG_20080215.0112.LDC2009T13	The governor denied any relationship between the incident and recent unsolved poisoning cases involving Chinese-made dumplings sold in Japan.
21502	XIN_ENG_20080215.0112.LDC2009T13	Analysts said that the case in Tokushima indicated the possibility that food products might be contaminated during the distribution and retail process in Japan.
21503	XIN_ENG_20080215.0112.LDC2009T13	The Japanese health ministry issued a notice in 2004 forbidding the placement of pesticide in areas for foods.

21508	XIN_ENG_20080221.0277.LDC2009T13	NAIROBI, Feb. 21 (Xinhua)
21509	XIN_ENG_20080221.0277.LDC2009T13	U.S. President George W. Bush promised U.S. support for Liberia's recovery from a crippling civil war as he visited Thursday the staunchest ally of America in Africa, on the fifth and final stop of his trip to the continent.
21510	XIN_ENG_20080221.0277.LDC2009T13	"We want to help you recover from a horrible period and live lives of hope and peace," Bush told Liberian President Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf in Monrovia, the war- damaged coastal capital of the small West African state, according to reports reaching here.
21511	XIN_ENG_20080221.0277.LDC2009T13	It was the first visit in 30 years by a U.S. president to Liberia, which, being Africa's first republic founded by freed slaves from America in 1847, has close ties with the United States.
21512	XIN_ENG_20080221.0277.LDC2009T13	Praising her "courage and leadership," Bush presented Johnson- Sirleaf, Africa's first elected woman head of state, with the National Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian award that a U.S. president can bestow.
21513	XIN_ENG_20080221.0277.LDC2009T13	Bush vowed sustained U.S. help to battle poverty and disease as well as an education initiative -- 1 million textbooks and desks and seating for 10,000 students by the beginning of the next school year.
21514	XIN_ENG_20080221.0277.LDC2009T13	The U.S. First Lady Laura Bush pledged to about a dozen Liberian school children she met at the foreign affairs ministry offices that "We American people are going to do everything we can to help Liberians overcome the challenges they are facing."
21515	XIN_ENG_20080221.0277.LDC2009T13	Bush was in Liberia at the end of a trip that has taken him to Benin, Tanzania, Rwanda and Ghana, bearing more than 1 billion dollars in aid as he tried to highlight U.S. backed "success stories" and urged an end to regional conflicts.
21516	XIN_ENG_20080221.0277.LDC2009T13	The U.S. president noted that the United States, partnering with the United Nations, has been working to train a new Liberian armed forces after the latest gruesome fighting claimed some 200, 000 lives.
21517	XIN_ENG_20080221.0277.LDC2009T13	"We are working to heal the wounds of war, and strengthen democracy, and build a new armed forces that will be a source of security for the Liberian people, instead of a source of terror," he was quoted as saying.
21518	XIN_ENG_20080221.0277.LDC2009T13	He visited a U.S. funded military training facility where U.S. defense contractors have been training the new Liberian army following the end of a devastating 1989-2003 civil war.
21519	XIN_ENG_20080221.0277.LDC2009T13	Since 2003, Washington has spent 139 million U.S. dollars to help modernize Liberia's armed forces.
21520	XIN_ENG_20080221.0277.LDC2009T13	Different from other African countries, who have spurned U.S. overtures for a greater military presence on the continent, Liberia has said it is willing to host a new continental U.S. military command, known as AFRICOM.
21521	XIN_ENG_20080221.0277.LDC2009T13	However, Bush and his host did not publicly discuss Liberia's offer to host the AFRICOM.
21522	XIN_ENG_20080221.0277.LDC2009T13	Some African critics have tied AFRICOM to the fact that by 2015 Washington expects that 25 percent of the oil it imports will come from the continent, basically from the Gulf of Guinea.
21523	XIN_ENG_20080221.0277.LDC2009T13	In Ghana, however, Bush denied any plans for new bases and said AFRICOM "is aiming to help provide military assistance to African nations, so African nations are more capable of dealing with Africa's conflicts, like peacekeeping training."
21524	XIN_ENG_20080221.0277.LDC2009T13	Under a nine-year U.S. African Education Initiative, Liberia is receiving 600 million dollars until 2010.
21525	XIN_ENG_20080221.0277.LDC2009T13	The trip, which started last Saturday, is Bush's second visit to the continent since he became president more than seven years ago.
21526	XIN_ENG_20080221.0277.LDC2009T13	It is also probably the last one before his term ends in January next year.
21527	XIN_ENG_20080221.0277.LDC2009T13	The White House said Bush's main focus was on the development agenda.
21528	XIN_ENG_20080221.0277.LDC2009T13	But analysts believe the ultimate goal of the visit is to promote U.S. long-term strategic interests in Africa.

21568	XIN_ENG_20080412.0083.LDC2009T13	Silvio Berlusconi is seeking a third term as Italy's prime minister as voters go to polls Sunday and Monday to decide who will lead their country during the next five years.
21569	XIN_ENG_20080412.0083.LDC2009T13	Born in Milan on Sept. 29, 1936, Berlusconi is not only a former prime minister, but also an entrepreneur and media mogul.
21570	XIN_ENG_20080412.0083.LDC2009T13	He entered politics in 1994 as founder of the center-right Forza Italia (Go, Italy) party and before the 2008 general election he launched the new political party People of Freedom in February which merged Forza Italia with National Alliance and other liberal and conservative parties.
21571	XIN_ENG_20080412.0083.LDC2009T13	Berlusconi was elected prime minister following the March 1994 elections, when Forza Italia gained a relative majority a mere three months after having been officially launched.
21572	XIN_ENG_20080412.0083.LDC2009T13	He formed the first right-wing administration in 34 years.
21573	XIN_ENG_20080412.0083.LDC2009T13	However, his cabinet collapsed after seven months, due to internal disagreements in the center-right coalition.
21574	XIN_ENG_20080412.0083.LDC2009T13	In the 1996 elections, he ran for prime minister again but was defeated by centre-left candidate Romano Prodi.
21575	XIN_ENG_20080412.0083.LDC2009T13	From 1996 to 2001 he was the leader of the parliamentary opposition.
21576	XIN_ENG_20080412.0083.LDC2009T13	In the 2001 elections, he was again the center-right candidate for prime minister and won against the center-left candidate Francesco Rutelli.
21577	XIN_ENG_20080412.0083.LDC2009T13	Berlusconi then led the only one Italian government in the last 50 years that has lasted a full five-year term, but he lost the April 2006 general election to Prodi, whose government collapsed in January after 20 months in power.
21578	XIN_ENG_20080412.0083.LDC2009T13	An early election was therefore called for April 13 and 14.
21579	XIN_ENG_20080412.0083.LDC2009T13	Latest opinion polls put Berlusconi five to nine percentage points ahead of his main opponent -- former Rome mayor Walter Veltroni.
21580	XIN_ENG_20080412.0083.LDC2009T13	Four days ahead of the general election, Berlusconi said he was 100-percent sure that he could win, appealing to his supporters to bring in more voters.
21581	XIN_ENG_20080412.0083.LDC2009T13	In economics, Berlusconi has endorsed conservative policies, such as lowering taxes and generally placing fewer constraints on enterprise, in an effort to encourage growth but also with the risk of raising public deficit.
21582	XIN_ENG_20080412.0083.LDC2009T13	In foreign policy, his views have been strongly pro-American, even at the expense of causing some damage to relations with other European countries.
21583	XIN_ENG_20080412.0083.LDC2009T13	In particular he supported George W. Bush in the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in 2003 by sending Italian troops to Iraq.
21584	XIN_ENG_20080412.0083.LDC2009T13	In social policy matters, the former Berlusconi government implemented a conservative program: passing stricter laws concerning immigration, artificial insemination and drug use.
21585	XIN_ENG_20080412.0083.LDC2009T13	In addition to a star politician, Berlusconi is the founder and main shareholder of Fininvest, one of the ten largest Italian privately-owned companies, which operate in media and finance.
21586	XIN_ENG_20080412.0083.LDC2009T13	He owns three of the seven national television channels, which account for nearly half the Italian TV market, as well as some of the country's most important newspapers.

21590	XIN_ENG_20080412.0083.LDC2009T13	Berlusconi's ownership of Italian television channels has been controversial.
21591	XIN_ENG_20080412.0083.LDC2009T13	According to Berlusconi's adversaries, his media empire has played a crucial role in his political success.
21592	XIN_ENG_20080412.0083.LDC2009T13	In contrast, his supporters claim the networks have always maintained a neutral political stance.

21600	XIN_ENG_20080413.0219.LDC2009T13	Relaxing Western music, huge wooden boxes and Shaolin monks: the seemingly incompatible elements are being combined into a new dancing performance set to debut in London next month.
21601	XIN_ENG_20080413.0219.LDC2009T13	"Sutra", the latest production by Flemish-Moroccan choreographer Sidi Larbi Cherkaoui, will be on show in the Sadler's Wells Theater from May 27 to 31.
21602	XIN_ENG_20080413.0219.LDC2009T13	The ticket prices range from 10 British pounds (19.70 U.S. dollars) to 35 pounds, he told Xinhua while directing a rehearsal at the Shaolin Temple, in central China's Henan Province, on Sunday.
21603	XIN_ENG_20080413.0219.LDC2009T13	Cherkaoui takes a completely unconventional method to interpret the martial art by underlining its contemplative spirit, beautiful movements and imitation of animals, rather than violence.
21604	XIN_ENG_20080413.0219.LDC2009T13	In the creative pantomime, 17 Buddhist Shaolin monks will make movements such as standing in the huge boxes that fall down one by one like dominos.
21605	XIN_ENG_20080413.0219.LDC2009T13	They also jump like frogs.
21606	XIN_ENG_20080413.0219.LDC2009T13	"I was inspired by the Shaolin understanding of movement, their complete identification with the living beings around them, and that remarkable ability to become the essence of a tiger, crane or snake," Cherkaoui said.
21607	XIN_ENG_20080413.0219.LDC2009T13	"I want to show my audience another layer of kung-fu."
21608	XIN_ENG_20080413.0219.LDC2009T13	In "Sutra", the 17 Shaolin kung-fu experts will show poetic and thought- provoking images of how human or animal life goes from beginning to the end.
21609	XIN_ENG_20080413.0219.LDC2009T13	"We wanted to go back to the internal conceits of Chan Buddhism, about the philosophy of emptiness and how energy goes through but is never contained by the body," Cherkaoui added.
21610	XIN_ENG_20080413.0219.LDC2009T13	"We want to show all qualities of kung-fu: relaxation as well as tension."
21611	XIN_ENG_20080413.0219.LDC2009T13	Hisashi Itoh, the pantomime producer, who called the kung-fu movement "the most beautiful over the past 15 decades", said they approached martial arts from a different perspective because there have been "too much entertainment for Shaolin".
21612	XIN_ENG_20080413.0219.LDC2009T13	"It should be something of our inner part, rather than just tense movement," he said.
21613	XIN_ENG_20080413.0219.LDC2009T13	Shi Xiaodong, 10, the youngest in the show, said the performance was just like playing a game.
21614	XIN_ENG_20080413.0219.LDC2009T13	"I don't understand what the pantomime intends to tell, but some of the actions in the performance were part of my routine, such as sitting in meditation."
21615	XIN_ENG_20080413.0219.LDC2009T13	The show, a joint work of Cherkaoui and famed British sculptor Antony Gormley, who created a constructed environment for the performers, would be part of the Chinese dance season to be held in the theater in May and June.
21616	XIN_ENG_20080413.0219.LDC2009T13	Established about 1,500 years ago, the Shaolin Temple is famous for combining martial arts with Buddhism and is a popular tourist attraction.

21620	XIN_ENG_20080421.0057.LDC2009T13	The Indonesian government has no evidence linking its citizens with an assassination attempt against Timor Leste President Jose Ramos-Horta, The Jakarta Post newspaper quoted a spokesman as reporting on Monday.
21621	XIN_ENG_20080421.0057.LDC2009T13	There was no evidence indicating a role of any Indonesian individuals in the February 11 attempt, Dino Patti Djalal, spokesman for President Susilo bambang Yudhoyono, said the newspaper.
21622	XIN_ENG_20080421.0057.LDC2009T13	"Based on evidence we have collected so far, there are no Indonesian citizens involved in the assassination attempt," he told English-language daily.
21623	XIN_ENG_20080421.0057.LDC2009T13	Dino was responding to Horta's allegations that Indonesia's private broadcaster MetroTV and officials of East Nusa Tenggara province had facilitated Maj. Alfredo Reinado's travel to Jakarta with false documents ahead of the assassination attempt.
21624	XIN_ENG_20080421.0057.LDC2009T13	Horta accused Metro TV of helping fugitive rebel Reinado visit Jakarta for an interview in May 2007.
21625	XIN_ENG_20080421.0057.LDC2009T13	Reinado was killed in one of two simultaneous attacks on Feb. 11 which targeted both Horta and Timor Leste Prime Minister Xanana Gusmao.
21626	XIN_ENG_20080421.0057.LDC2009T13	He specifically accused Metro TV journalist Desi Anwar, who he said organized the interview, of breaching a fundamental code of ethics and violating Timor Leste's law.
21627	XIN_ENG_20080421.0057.LDC2009T13	Horta said Metro TV and other Indonesian elements' actions contributed to the assassination attempt and that he could not rest until the truth of their involvement with Reinado was uncovered.
21628	XIN_ENG_20080421.0057.LDC2009T13	MetroTV dismissed all accusations against it and Desi.
21629	XIN_ENG_20080421.0057.LDC2009T13	"It is not true at all.
21630	XIN_ENG_20080421.0057.LDC2009T13	We are a TV station, not an institution to issue documents.
21631	XIN_ENG_20080421.0057.LDC2009T13	What we do is just interviewing, and broadcasting, nothing else," Metro TV deputy chief editor Makroen Sanjaya said.
21632	XIN_ENG_20080421.0057.LDC2009T13	Dino, too, rejected any possible involvement of Desi and Metro TV, saying such an interview did not mean they helped Reinado.
21633	XIN_ENG_20080421.0057.LDC2009T13	"Journalists can interview anyone.
21634	XIN_ENG_20080421.0057.LDC2009T13	But that does not mean they gave help.
21635	XIN_ENG_20080421.0057.LDC2009T13	Unless we have strong evidence, we can't say anyone was involved," Dino said.
21636	XIN_ENG_20080421.0057.LDC2009T13	On Friday, President Susilo said he was surprised at the reports.
21637	XIN_ENG_20080421.0057.LDC2009T13	He said Timor Leste leaders should not issue any statement to insinuate involvement on the part of Indonesia, which may cause confusion or misinterpretation by the international community and for the Indonesian people, and disrupt both countries' bilateral relations.

21642	XIN_ENG_20080423.0121.LDC2009T13	"I think Secretary Gates said it well.
21643	XIN_ENG_20080423.0121.LDC2009T13	'Soon' is a good, short answer," White House spokeswoman Dana Perino told reporters at her daily briefing.
21644	XIN_ENG_20080423.0121.LDC2009T13	"I'm not going to be able to say much on it today.
21645	XIN_ENG_20080423.0121.LDC2009T13	And I'm not confirming anything at this briefing in regards to the substance," Perino added, declining to give any reason for her silence.
21646	XIN_ENG_20080423.0121.LDC2009T13	It was reported that the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) would tell lawmakers that Israel hit a nuclear site, possibly a reactor, allegedly being constructed with the DPRK help.
21647	XIN_ENG_20080423.0121.LDC2009T13	The Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday that the DPRK was helping Syria build a plutonium-producing nuclear reactor before Israel bombed the site last September.
21648	XIN_ENG_20080423.0121.LDC2009T13	The Bush administration is set to tell Congress.
21649	XIN_ENG_20080423.0121.LDC2009T13	Neither Israel nor the United States has made public information about the strike in Syria, though speculation has been widespread that the targeted site was a nascent nuclear reactor.

21675	XIN_ENG_20080513.0311.LDC2009T13	At least 1,000 students and teachers were buried when a school in Beichuan County in southwest China collapsed, following Monday's earthquake measuring 7.8 on the Richter scale.
21676	XIN_ENG_20080513.0311.LDC2009T13	The main building of the Beichuan Middle School in Mianyang City, about 160 kilometers northeast of the epicenter in Wenchuan County, collapsed when the quake hit at about 2:30 p.m. and few students escaped, parents and rescuers said.

21682	XIN_ENG_20080513.0311.LDC2009T13	"I just pray my child is safe and sound," said one tearful mother.

21715	XIN_ENG_20080703.0057.LDC2009T13	Vietnam's total fertility rate (TFR) was decreasing, indicating the growth rate of population is slowing down, the Vietnam News Agency reported here Thursday.
21716	XIN_ENG_20080703.0057.LDC2009T13	Fertility rate refers to the number of births per women give.
21717	XIN_ENG_20080703.0057.LDC2009T13	The rate was 2.07 in 2007 in Vietnam, lowest since 1999 and marking a 0.2 drop from 2000, the agency cited officials from the United Nations Population Fund as saying.
21718	XIN_ENG_20080703.0057.LDC2009T13	The rate was lower than Laos of 4.4 and Cambodia of 3.6.
21719	XIN_ENG_20080703.0057.LDC2009T13	It varies geographically within Vietnam, ranging from 2.8 in the central highlands, to 1.7 in the southeastern regions.
21720	XIN_ENG_20080703.0057.LDC2009T13	The decrease is largely due to the increasing usage of contraceptive methods, according to the fund.

21731	XIN_ENG_20080706.0027.LDC2009T13	Islamic Hamas movement on Sunday warned Israel against carrying out any military action in the Gaza Strip in response to homemade rockets from Gaza at Israel.
21732	XIN_ENG_20080706.0027.LDC2009T13	"Israel would be playing with fire in case it carries out any military action against Gaza," said Sami Abu Zuhri, Hamas spokesman in Gaza, adding "The occupation (Israel) should think carefully before carrying out such an action."
21733	XIN_ENG_20080706.0027.LDC2009T13	Egypt brokered on June 19 a ceasefire between Israel and Gaza militant groups, led by Hamas movement.
21734	XIN_ENG_20080706.0027.LDC2009T13	Israel agreed to stop military actions in Gaza and lifting blockade against Gaza in exchange for the Palestinian militants stopping homemade rocket attacks on Israel.
21735	XIN_ENG_20080706.0027.LDC2009T13	However, since June 19, the day the truce came into effect in Gaza, three homemade rockets have been fired from Gaza at Israel, for which the Islamic Jihad and Fatah armed wing claimed responsibilities.
21736	XIN_ENG_20080706.0027.LDC2009T13	During the start of the ceasefire, Israel has opened Gaza crossings only for eight days and kept the crossings closed following the three separate homemade rocket attacks.
21737	XIN_ENG_20080706.0027.LDC2009T13	One of the truce conditions between Hamas and Israel is that Israel eases a one- year blockade on the Strip and allows needed goods and raw materials for construction and industry into the enclave.
21738	XIN_ENG_20080706.0027.LDC2009T13	"So far, we don't see a real Israeli commitment to the truce.
21739	XIN_ENG_20080706.0027.LDC2009T13	The violations of the truce are still going on and the extent of reopening of the crossings is much less than what was agreed upon, " said Abu Zuhri.

21741	XIN_ENG_20080709.0185.LDC2009T13	by Wang Jiangang
21742	XIN_ENG_20080709.0185.LDC2009T13	NEW YORK, July 9 (Xinhua) -- When Alfred Abati first visited China in 1988, he never thought that this ancient civilization would be able to host such a huge international event like the Olympic Games so soon.
21743	XIN_ENG_20080709.0185.LDC2009T13	Two decades later, just one month before the kickoff of the Beijing Olympic Games, Abati, vice president of the New York Chapter of the U.S.-China People's Friendship Association (USCPFA), said that any miracles can happen in China.
21744	XIN_ENG_20080709.0185.LDC2009T13	"Although I will not be there physically, I will be there with the Chinese people in spirit and cheer on all the athletes," Abati said with delight, despite his poor health condition.
21745	XIN_ENG_20080709.0185.LDC2009T13	Abati said although he has not been to Beijing for four years, he never stopped keeping an eye on the developments in China.
21746	XIN_ENG_20080709.0185.LDC2009T13	"I have been very impressed with the preparations that Beijing has made for the upcoming Olympics," he said, adding that the event was "wonderful" for all the Chinese people.
21747	XIN_ENG_20080709.0185.LDC2009T13	"The Chinese people should be so proud of their country that they have been able to pull this off," he said.
21748	XIN_ENG_20080709.0185.LDC2009T13	Abati has been to China several times, but he seems to have an exceptionally strong memory of his trip to Beijing in 2004 when he was selected as a special delegate for the celebrations marking the 55th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.
21749	XIN_ENG_20080709.0185.LDC2009T13	Abati recalled that he was received by the Chinese People's Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries.
21750	XIN_ENG_20080709.0185.LDC2009T13	He visited the building of the Beijing organizing Committee for the Games of the 29th Olympiad (BOCOG) where he was presented with Beijing Olympic Games posters.
21751	XIN_ENG_20080709.0185.LDC2009T13	As for the politicization of the Beijing Olympic Games, Abati said it is not fair to do that as it will hurt the feelings of the athletes.
21752	XIN_ENG_20080709.0185.LDC2009T13	The athletes have been working very hard, and they should have the opportunity to do their activities, Abati said, adding that the Olympics must be "politics free."
21753	XIN_ENG_20080709.0185.LDC2009T13	Abati used to be a member of the swimming team in Staten Island where he lives.
21754	XIN_ENG_20080709.0185.LDC2009T13	Founded in 1974, the USCPFA is a non-profit, tax-exempt educational organization with the aim of promoting friendship and understanding between the American and Chinese people.
21755	XIN_ENG_20080709.0185.LDC2009T13	He added that the friendship between the two peoples was important as it would help improve relations between the two countries.
21756	XIN_ENG_20080709.0185.LDC2009T13	Abati said that through decades of hard work, China has become a major world power.
21757	XIN_ENG_20080709.0185.LDC2009T13	He believes that China will surely make the Olympic Games a great success.
21758	XIN_ENG_20080709.0185.LDC2009T13	"I feel happy for the Chinese people and they will give the world a pleasant surprise," he said.

21760	XIN_ENG_20080729.0322.LDC2009T13	BEIJING, July 29 (Xinhua)
21761	XIN_ENG_20080729.0322.LDC2009T13	The Beijing Olympic canoe/kayak slalom water course is the world's best and also the hardest, said Russian and British paddlers on Tuesday.
21762	XIN_ENG_20080729.0322.LDC2009T13	"The slalom course is the world's finest, but it is also very challenging," said Russian kayaker Perova Aleksandra.
21763	XIN_ENG_20080729.0322.LDC2009T13	"This, however, can make us enjoy more of the event, and the audience can also watch more exciting competitions."
21764	XIN_ENG_20080729.0322.LDC2009T13	Aleksandra, 7th finisher at the Canoe/Kayak Slalom Racing World Championships 2006, is the first woman paddler to represent Russia at the Olympics.
21765	XIN_ENG_20080729.0322.LDC2009T13	The Russian noted that there was no slalom course in her country and she trained in Czech, home to the world's top paddlers, to prepare for the Beijing Games.
21766	XIN_ENG_20080729.0322.LDC2009T13	Aleksandra said she would strive for a good result at the Games, but added that her rivals from Germany, Czech and China were obstacles to her target.
21767	XIN_ENG_20080729.0322.LDC2009T13	"Chinese paddlers were at the same level with us four years ago," she said.
21768	XIN_ENG_20080729.0322.LDC2009T13	"We made progress over the past four years, but China made a stunning leap forward and left us far behind."
21769	XIN_ENG_20080729.0322.LDC2009T13	Chinese paddlers in canoe double (C2) and kayak single (K1) had made very impressive progress, and the home water would help to make them the Olympic medal hopefuls, Aleksandra added.
21770	XIN_ENG_20080729.0322.LDC2009T13	"The water course is very good, but it is tricky and tough," British canoist David Florence said after a one-hour afternoon training session at the Shunyi Olympic Rowing and Canoeing Park, venue for the Olympic rowing, canoeing, and marathon swimming events.
21771	XIN_ENG_20080729.0322.LDC2009T13	Florence arrived at Beijing on Saturday and started training on Sunday.
21772	XIN_ENG_20080729.0322.LDC2009T13	"I'll get used to the course in the two-week training in the run-up to the Games," he said.
21773	XIN_ENG_20080729.0322.LDC2009T13	There are four disciplines in the canoe/kayak slalom event, men's C1, C2, K1, and women's K1.

21782	XIN_ENG_20080808.0267.LDC2009T13	Many Olympic sailors felt proud of carrying the national flag of their own countries at the opening ceremony on Friday before sailing their nations to Olympic glory.
21783	XIN_ENG_20080808.0267.LDC2009T13	Ciara Peelo, Ireland's most dedicated Laser Radial sailor, will lead the 51-strong Olympic team at the National Stadium in Beijing.
21784	XIN_ENG_20080808.0267.LDC2009T13	"The Olympic Games themselves are an inspiration.
21785	XIN_ENG_20080808.0267.LDC2009T13	Honor will help to motivate me to do my best for my country at the Games," she said, the only female sailor of the Irish six-strong sailing team.
21786	XIN_ENG_20080808.0267.LDC2009T13	Brazil's legendary double gold medalist Robert Scheidt also hoped the honorary position would bring him luck for gunning the third Olympic gold in a row.
21787	XIN_ENG_20080808.0267.LDC2009T13	"It was quite emotional.
21788	XIN_ENG_20080808.0267.LDC2009T13	Usually, they do not announce the flag bearer until right before the opening ceremony.
21789	XIN_ENG_20080808.0267.LDC2009T13	It is very special to have a flag presented to me directly from the President," said Scheidt, Laser gold medalist in 1996 and 2004, Laser silver medalist in 2000.
21790	XIN_ENG_20080808.0267.LDC2009T13	Alejandro Foglia, the only sailor from Uruguay, is not only the flag bearer for the opening ceremony in Beijing, but also in Qingdao.
21791	XIN_ENG_20080808.0267.LDC2009T13	"There are not very many Uruguayan athletes competing.
21792	XIN_ENG_20080808.0267.LDC2009T13	I was selected because of my commitment to the sport," said Foglia, 24, from Laser class.
21793	XIN_ENG_20080808.0267.LDC2009T13	Barbara Kendall, windsurfer from New Zealand, is the first woman to parade her country's colors at the opening ceremony.
21794	XIN_ENG_20080808.0267.LDC2009T13	"It is announced only a couple of days before the ceremony and it is quite an event," said the 40-year-old from Auckland.
21795	XIN_ENG_20080808.0267.LDC2009T13	Some 300 sailors and coaches left Qingdao on Friday morning for Beijing in two chartered planes to attend the opening ceremony.

21809	XIN_ENG_20080815.0485.LDC2009T13	Again, the European paddlers dominated the Olympic canoeing slalom event.
21810	XIN_ENG_20080815.0485.LDC2009T13	They swept four gold medals, won three silver and two bronze.
21811	XIN_ENG_20080815.0485.LDC2009T13	Three gold in the men's canoe single (C1) and canoe double (C2), and women's kayak single (K1) went to Slovakia, and one in the men's K1 to Germany.

21813	XIN_ENG_20080815.0485.LDC2009T13	On Friday, the powerful twin brothers Pavol and Peter Hochschorner, Olympic champions in Sdyney and Athens, won the unprecedented third slalom Olympic gold in the men's C2.

21816	XIN_ENG_20080815.0485.LDC2009T13	Togo took bronze in the men's K1, its first-ever Olympic medal.
21817	XIN_ENG_20080815.0485.LDC2009T13	But Togo's Benjamin Boukpeti should by no means be counted as an non-European.
21818	XIN_ENG_20080815.0485.LDC2009T13	He was born and raised in France and has only visited the western African country once.
21819	XIN_ENG_20080815.0485.LDC2009T13	He chose to represent Togo because his father was from there and the selection in France was hard.
21820	XIN_ENG_20080815.0485.LDC2009T13	China's efforts to break the dominance on the home water also came in vain.
21821	XIN_ENG_20080815.0485.LDC2009T13	Its medal hopes, the men's C2 team of Hu Minghai and Shu Junrong, and the women's kayaker Li Jingjing, failed to make finals after incurring heavy penalties for missing gates.

21823	XIN_ENG_20080815.0485.LDC2009T13	Europe's domination would be more prominent if the International Canoe Federation (ICF) allowed all the top paddlers to compete in the Olympics.
21824	XIN_ENG_20080815.0485.LDC2009T13	ICF President, Ulrich Feldhoff, acknowledged on Thursday that many top paddlers who were able to make final in the Olympics had to stay at home because each country was allowed to send at most one boat in each category.
21825	XIN_ENG_20080815.0485.LDC2009T13	"About 75 percent of the athletes qualified by performances, and 25 percent qualified by enthusiasm," said Feldhoff.
21826	XIN_ENG_20080815.0485.LDC2009T13	"We have to strive a balance at the Olympics, as it's no European Championships."
21827	XIN_ENG_20080815.0485.LDC2009T13	Though no break of Europe's dominance was foreseen in the near future, ICF would happy to see more emerging powers in the white water sport, ICF Slalom Committee chairperson, Jean-Michel Prono, told a briefing on Thursday.

21829	XIN_ENG_20080815.0485.LDC2009T13	it's a good signal of the vigor of the sport," said Prono.
21830	XIN_ENG_20080815.0485.LDC2009T13	"The most nations share the medals, the most we get people involved into the sport.
21831	XIN_ENG_20080815.0485.LDC2009T13	That's our goal."

21854	XIN_ENG_20080816.0437.LDC2009T13	In 2006 the boy did two things.
21855	XIN_ENG_20080816.0437.LDC2009T13	One was quitting competitions to join the armed force, where he was supposed to "train soldiers how to shoot".
21856	XIN_ENG_20080816.0437.LDC2009T13	Founded in 1956, the shooting squad of the U.S. armed force has produced many ace shooters.
21857	XIN_ENG_20080816.0437.LDC2009T13	To date, its members have achieved 21 Olympic medals.
21858	XIN_ENG_20080816.0437.LDC2009T13	The team members trained five days a week and five to six hours a day.
21859	XIN_ENG_20080816.0437.LDC2009T13	Like real soldiers, they received psychological drill as well as physical, while psychology is important in shooting competitions.
21860	XIN_ENG_20080816.0437.LDC2009T13	"I learned a lot from the army, like determination, perseverance and discipline," he said, adding that this was helpful in his shooting career.
21861	XIN_ENG_20080816.0437.LDC2009T13	As his coach Lloyd Woodhouse saw it, joining the army could put many ace shooters together for them to compare with each other and improve.
21862	XIN_ENG_20080816.0437.LDC2009T13	"When you train alone, you can work really hard, but you don't know where your problems are," he said.
21863	XIN_ENG_20080816.0437.LDC2009T13	The other thing Hancock did was meeting Rebekah who was from a nurse school.
21864	XIN_ENG_20080816.0437.LDC2009T13	"She is a trap shooter and I saw her competing in the spring of 2006," he recalled.
21865	XIN_ENG_20080816.0437.LDC2009T13	Then Hancock said to himself, this is the girl I was looking for.
21866	XIN_ENG_20080816.0437.LDC2009T13	They held their wedding ceremony this May in Eatonton, Georgia, this year.
21867	XIN_ENG_20080816.0437.LDC2009T13	SHOOTING GENIUS
21868	XIN_ENG_20080816.0437.LDC2009T13	Hancock said he liked the flash target used in the Beijing Olympics, because the pink smoke made him excited.
21869	XIN_ENG_20080816.0437.LDC2009T13	"When I am shooting skeet, I always want to hit the center of the plate and see how it break," he said.
21870	XIN_ENG_20080816.0437.LDC2009T13	The ambitious boy had his goal for this sports gala.
21871	XIN_ENG_20080816.0437.LDC2009T13	"I put a lot of pressure on myself, and it helped me get determined to win," he said.
21872	XIN_ENG_20080816.0437.LDC2009T13	"Olympics is not different from other events, just bigger."
21873	XIN_ENG_20080816.0437.LDC2009T13	During competitions, he did feel nervous, rubbing his sweating hands against his pants from time to time.
21874	XIN_ENG_20080816.0437.LDC2009T13	Fortunately he held his nerves, both in the final round and the shoot-off.
21875	XIN_ENG_20080816.0437.LDC2009T13	When he won the medal, his mother sitting behind shedding tears, while his 74 -year-old gray-haired coach jumped over to hug him.
21876	XIN_ENG_20080816.0437.LDC2009T13	"Hancock is not only talented, he is a genius," said Chinese veteran shooter Zhang Shan, gold medalist in skeet at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics.
21877	XIN_ENG_20080816.0437.LDC2009T13	The big boy well remembered he once pointed at the televised video clip of blockbuster "Hancock" to his wife.
21878	XIN_ENG_20080816.0437.LDC2009T13	"Look, it's me," he said.
21879	XIN_ENG_20080816.0437.LDC2009T13	Rebekah smiled and didn't reply.
21880	XIN_ENG_20080816.0437.LDC2009T13	In retrospect, no matter she agreed or not at that time, the remarks seemed more than a joke.

21888	XIN_ENG_20080818.0408.LDC2009T13	"The Olympic Measurement Committee approved the replacement of the boat and found that it complied with class rules and all equipment inspections carried out in the Medal Race Quarantine Procedures," wrote the hearing document.

21893	XIN_ENG_20080818.0408.LDC2009T13	Iker Martinez from Spain said they were stuck in the jury room on Sunday reading papers for hours.
21894	XIN_ENG_20080818.0408.LDC2009T13	When the decision was made, the first thing that they said to the Danish team was congratulations.

21990	XIN_ENG_20080917.0273.LDC2009T13	BEIJING, Sept. 17 (Xinhua)
21991	XIN_ENG_20080917.0273.LDC2009T13	The Beijing Paralympic Games not free of doping was a pity, said the Internatianal Paralympic Committee (IPC) president Philip Craven here on Wednesday.
21992	XIN_ENG_20080917.0273.LDC2009T13	The IPC reported three doping cases, all from the sport of powerlifting and another positive case under the national Paralympic committee's control came to light during Games.
21993	XIN_ENG_20080917.0273.LDC2009T13	"The winter Games were free of it in Turino Games completely.
21994	XIN_ENG_20080917.0273.LDC2009T13	So we are not happy that there are still three positive tests.
21995	XIN_ENG_20080917.0273.LDC2009T13	I don't think that we are going away and laughing at this and saying that was a pretty good Games in the doping point of view," said Craven.
21996	XIN_ENG_20080917.0273.LDC2009T13	"Those three tests are something that we don't want and we will fight to catch the cheats if they keep on showing on the Games even if it's only the three of them," he said.
21997	XIN_ENG_20080917.0273.LDC2009T13	Pakistani powerlifter Naveed Ahmed Butt became the first to fail the doping test at the Games.
21998	XIN_ENG_20080917.0273.LDC2009T13	Facourou Sissoko of Mali and Liudmyla Osmanova of Ukraine, both powerlifting competitors, were also expelled from the Paralympics after testing positive for steroids.
21999	XIN_ENG_20080917.0273.LDC2009T13	Another doping case was from German wheelchair basketball player Ahmet Coskun who was kicked out of the Games as traces of finasteride were found in his urine sample taken on August 23 but it was not an IPC test.
22000	XIN_ENG_20080917.0273.LDC2009T13	The German National Paralympic Committee announced the positive result and withdrew the player from the Games.
22001	XIN_ENG_20080917.0273.LDC2009T13	Craven said all three doping cases from the Games were found out in out-of- competition tests and the low number proved that the program was effective in the fight against doping.
22002	XIN_ENG_20080917.0273.LDC2009T13	"Each of them is out of competition.
22003	XIN_ENG_20080917.0273.LDC2009T13	To date, we haven't had one in-competition doping case," he said.
22004	XIN_ENG_20080917.0273.LDC2009T13	"We think that what have been put in place here with great cooperation with BOCOG has showed that the Paralympic Games are near enough free of doping."
22005	XIN_ENG_20080917.0273.LDC2009T13	About 1,100 tests both out-of-competition and in-competition would be carried out among some 4,000 athletes during the Sept. 6-17 Games.
22006	XIN_ENG_20080917.0273.LDC2009T13	"We will work even harder on the education.
22007	XIN_ENG_20080917.0273.LDC2009T13	We worked very hard on the education of our sports for the last four years.

22010	XIN_ENG_20080920.0110.LDC2009T13	BERLIN, Sept. 20 (Xinhua)
22011	XIN_ENG_20080920.0110.LDC2009T13	German Chancellor Angela Merkel accused Saturday the United States and Britain of blocking her government's previous efforts to tighten the controls of financial markets.
22012	XIN_ENG_20080920.0110.LDC2009T13	According to German radio Deutsche Welle, Merkel made the remarks when speaking to a rally in Linz of Austria on Saturday, where she was campaigning on behalf of the Austrian conservative People's Party (OeVP).
22013	XIN_ENG_20080920.0110.LDC2009T13	Merkel said her government had tried in vain to win G8 support last year for tighter regulation of hedge funds and financial oversight of capital markets, hinting that she felt vindicated in her stance as a financial disaster unfolded on Wall Street in recent days.
22014	XIN_ENG_20080920.0110.LDC2009T13	"It was said for a long time 'Let the markets take care of themselves' and that there is 'no need for more transparency'," Merkel told the rally.
22015	XIN_ENG_20080920.0110.LDC2009T13	"Today we are a step further because even America and Britain are saying 'Yes, we need more transparency, we need better standards for the ratings agencies'," Merkel was quoted as saying.
22016	XIN_ENG_20080920.0110.LDC2009T13	In a separate interview with a Munich newspaper, Muenchner Merkur, to be published on Monday, Merkel criticized the United States and British governments for obstructing Germany's efforts in the first half of 2007 to bring greater transparency to the markets.
22017	XIN_ENG_20080920.0110.LDC2009T13	"I criticize the perception that the financial markets have of themselves," she told the paper.
22018	XIN_ENG_20080920.0110.LDC2009T13	"Alas, they have opposed for too long the introduction of rules with the backing of the British and American governments," she said.
22019	XIN_ENG_20080920.0110.LDC2009T13	Merkel said when Germany headed the G8 group of industrialized nations last year, it had advocated greater transparency in international financial transactions, especially in hedge funds.
22020	XIN_ENG_20080920.0110.LDC2009T13	She said a single nation like Germany could do little by itself to fix the international financial system.
22021	XIN_ENG_20080920.0110.LDC2009T13	"That's why I and Finance Minister Steinbrueck insisted back in 2007 during the German presidency of the Group of Eight that we need more rules for greater transparency in international money dealing, with the ratings agencies and with the hedge funds," she was quoted as saying.
22022	XIN_ENG_20080920.0110.LDC2009T13	"Some progress was made at the time, but it was not adequately supported by the United States and Britain," she said.
22023	XIN_ENG_20080920.0110.LDC2009T13	On Sept. 14, the fourth largest U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers Holdings announced that it went bankruptcy, triggering worldwide financial turmoil including Germany, the biggest economy of Europe.

22025	XIN_ENG_20080925.0096.LDC2009T13	MOGADISHU, Sept. 25 (Xinhua)
22026	XIN_ENG_20080925.0096.LDC2009T13	Somali Prime Minister Nur Hassan Hussein on Thursday said insurgent groups that have not been part of the peace talks between the Somali transitional government and the opposition can still join in the national reconciliation process.
22027	XIN_ENG_20080925.0096.LDC2009T13	Speaking at a news conference shortly after returning from Djibouti where he led a government delegation to the talks with the opposition, the Alliance for the Reliberation of Somalia, Hussein said "doors are open" for the groups opposed to the peace talks with the transitional government.
22028	XIN_ENG_20080925.0096.LDC2009T13	"It is never late for them to join because our doors are open for every one interested in peace and dialogue," Hussein told reporters at his residence in Mogadishu.
22029	XIN_ENG_20080925.0096.LDC2009T13	A number of insurgent groups have boycotted the peace talks between the transitional government and a major faction of the opposition that has controlled much of southern and central Somalia before their ouster by Somali government troops backed by their Ethiopian allies in December 2006.
22030	XIN_ENG_20080925.0096.LDC2009T13	The Prime Minister condemned the shelling in the past three day of Mogadishu airport by the Al-Shabaab insurgent fighters, who last week threatened to shoot down any plane that lands at the airport which they claimed is being used for military purposes.
22031	XIN_ENG_20080925.0096.LDC2009T13	He called on local airline companies to restart using the airport which he said was serving the public.
22032	XIN_ENG_20080925.0096.LDC2009T13	No commercial plane has landed at the airport since the threat was issued last week.

22035	XIN_ENG_20080926.0273.LDC2009T13	A new hydropower plant started generating electricity in southwest China's Tibet Autonomous Region on Friday.
22036	XIN_ENG_20080926.0273.LDC2009T13	The Xoka Hydropower Station, in Gongbo'gyamda County in east Tibet's Nyingchi Prefecture, has four generating units each with a capacity of 10,000 kw, said Wang Lidong, director of the station's construction headquarters under the Tibet Power Co. Ltd.
22037	XIN_ENG_20080926.0273.LDC2009T13	The station can generate 182 million kwh of electricity a year, Wang said.
22038	XIN_ENG_20080926.0273.LDC2009T13	"It can help ease the power supply shortage in Nyingchi," he said.
22039	XIN_ENG_20080926.0273.LDC2009T13	Construction began in June 2006 with an investment of 723 million yuan (106 million U.S. dollars) and its reservoir holds 860,000 cubic meters of water with a dam of almost 20 meters in height.
22040	XIN_ENG_20080926.0273.LDC2009T13	Nyingchi has been facing power shortage for years, local officials have said.
22041	XIN_ENG_20080926.0273.LDC2009T13	"The operation of the new power station will boost the construction of power and transport facilities in Gongbo'gyamda County," said Li Sang, head of the county.
22042	XIN_ENG_20080926.0273.LDC2009T13	"It will also help improve living conditions for residents," he said.

22048	XIN_ENG_20081008.0078.LDC2009T13	The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) Wednesday started a three- day workshop on avian influenza research activities in Cambodia, said a FAO press release.
22049	XIN_ENG_20081008.0078.LDC2009T13	The workshop took place in Sihanoukville with support from the Cambodian Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries with the aim of bringing together researchers from various disciplines to share the results of their HPAI H5N1-related research in Cambodia, said the release.
22050	XIN_ENG_20081008.0078.LDC2009T13	It also aimed to facilitate dynamic exchange of views between researchers and decision makers on epidemiological, social and economic issues relevant to HPAI H5N1 in Cambodia, according to the release.
22051	XIN_ENG_20081008.0078.LDC2009T13	It still aimed to identify and prioritize major knowledge gaps that research needs to fill and how to best address them in the near future and contribute to the development of a second generation of science-based HPAI H5N1 risk management strategies that carefully consider their impacts on the livelihoods of the poor, the release added.
22052	XIN_ENG_20081008.0078.LDC2009T13	Compared to neighboring Thailand and Vietnam, Cambodia was only mildly affected by HPAI.
22053	XIN_ENG_20081008.0078.LDC2009T13	Nevertheless, Cambodia's animal and public health authorities heavily engaged in HPAI H5N1 control and monitoring, and many of the implemented measures are still in place, said the release.
22054	XIN_ENG_20081008.0078.LDC2009T13	Alongside these control measures, a wide array of field and laboratory research was initiated in Cambodia, both by national and international agencies, it said.
22055	XIN_ENG_20081008.0078.LDC2009T13	As much of this research is reaching completion or has been completed and as the HPAI H5N1 control paradigm is shifting from emergency reaction to longer term disease management, it is timely to collate, review and synthesize research carried out in Cambodia on various aspects of HPAI to inform policymaking, investment and further research, it added.

22057	XIN_ENG_20081008.0121.LDC2009T13	MANILA, Oct. 8 (Xinhua)
22058	XIN_ENG_20081008.0121.LDC2009T13	The Philippine government would not go back to the negotiating table currently with the separatist Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF), an official said on Wednesday.
22059	XIN_ENG_20081008.0121.LDC2009T13	The government has no intention to resume its talks with the MILF because of the alarming increase in the number of internally displaced persons as government forces continue to hunt down three MILF rouge commanders, Executive Secretary Eduardo Ermita said during his weekly media briefing.
22060	XIN_ENG_20081008.0121.LDC2009T13	Government forces have been pursuing MILF commanders Ameril Ombra Kato, Aleem Sulaiman Pangalian and Abdullah Macapaar for two months.
22061	XIN_ENG_20081008.0121.LDC2009T13	Their followers attacked villages in the southern region of Mindanao after the government failed to sign a territorial pact with the MILF.
22062	XIN_ENG_20081008.0121.LDC2009T13	As a show of sincerity for the projected resumption of the talks, the leadership of the MILF should first surrender to the authorities the commanders involved in the bloody attacks in the southern provinces of North Cotabato, Lanao Del Norte and Saranggani, the Philippine News Agency citing Ermita reported.
22063	XIN_ENG_20081008.0121.LDC2009T13	"They should show goodwill and develop confidence building by taking these people in their custody and then inform the national government of the measures that they have undertaken," Ermita said.
22064	XIN_ENG_20081008.0121.LDC2009T13	He added that only after the incidence of violence stops, is the government willing to sit down with MILF representatives on the negotiating table.
22065	XIN_ENG_20081008.0121.LDC2009T13	Ermita said that the government has extended 126.3 million pesos (2.65 million U.S. dollars) for relief assistance to affected residents, which had increased to 127,164 families or 611, 753 persons.
22066	XIN_ENG_20081008.0121.LDC2009T13	The 12,000-strong MILF has been fighting for a separate Islamic state since 1978.
22067	XIN_ENG_20081008.0121.LDC2009T13	It signed a ceasefire in 2003 with the government, but skirmishes have been going off and on along with the peace talks between the two sides.
22068	XIN_ENG_20081008.0121.LDC2009T13	Violence escalated in Mindanao after the Philippine Supreme Court halted the signing of the territorial pact scheduled for Aug. 5 in Kuala Lumpur.
22069	XIN_ENG_20081008.0121.LDC2009T13	The government scrapped the deal and dismissed its talks panel following the clashes.

22073	XIN_ENG_20081011.0048.LDC2009T13	Thailand's Supreme Commander General Songkitti Jakkabatra said Saturday that there would not be a military coup.
22074	XIN_ENG_20081011.0048.LDC2009T13	Songkitti said military top brass officers have been brainstorming for a solution for the political turmoil, in which anti-government protesters led by the People's Alliance for Democracy (PAD) were engaged in stand-off and later violent clashes with the authorities, and have agreed on a solution, but not a coup, according to news website The Nation.
22075	XIN_ENG_20081011.0048.LDC2009T13	"I won't tell about a solution now but the military has thought about it," Songkitti was quoted as saying.
22076	XIN_ENG_20081011.0048.LDC2009T13	"I affirm that there will be no coup."
22077	XIN_ENG_20081011.0048.LDC2009T13	The Supreme Commander's affirmation came after the Army Chief Gen Anupong Paojinda repeatedly ruled out a military coup as a way out of the crisis, as has been witnessed on Sept. 19, 2006 when then Army Chief Sonthi Boonyaratkalin led military top brass including then First Army Region commander Anupong to stage a coup to topple Thaksin Shinawatra out of premiership.
22078	XIN_ENG_20081011.0048.LDC2009T13	The current confrontation between PAD, a consistent opposer coalition of Thaksin, and the current government led by PM Somchai Wongsawat, Thaksin's brother-in-law, has stemmed from the conflicts since the Thaksin administration.
22079	XIN_ENG_20081011.0048.LDC2009T13	The PAD now portrays itself as royalists and puts those loyal to Thaksin as the opposite side, and keeps calling the Somchai government, which they call a proxy of Thaksin, to step down.
22080	XIN_ENG_20081011.0048.LDC2009T13	Military top brass has conceded that the 2006 coup had failed to solve the conflicts.

22085	XIN_ENG_20081019.0132.LDC2009T13	The encounter took place at the Maracanazinho Gym in Rio de Janeiro.

22087	XIN_ENG_20081019.0132.LDC2009T13	In that occasion, the Spanish team interrupted the sequence of consecutive titles obtained by Brazil who had won in 1989, 1992 and 1996.
22088	XIN_ENG_20081019.0132.LDC2009T13	The final game of the sixth World Indoor Soccer in Brazil 2008 was balanced but also tense.
22089	XIN_ENG_20081019.0132.LDC2009T13	The hosts, animated by the rematch and with the support of their fans, made pressure on the first half, which made the Spanish goalkeeper Amado felt great when defending their goal in at least four occasions.
22090	XIN_ENG_20081019.0132.LDC2009T13	The first goal of the match was made by Brazilian Marquinhos, in a corner kick at the minute 25.

22147	XIN_ENG_20081121.0093.LDC2009T13	NAIROBI Nov. 21 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government has urged Africans to defined their destiny and steer their homegrown development agenda by using local resources rather than relying on funding from foreign countries.
22148	XIN_ENG_20081121.0093.LDC2009T13	Kenyan Prime Minister Raila Odinga said the widespread notion that tangible development Africa could only be realized through funding from Western countries and the Bretton Woods Institutions was misplaced, adding that it was time the continent sought an alternative source of capital from local resources.
22149	XIN_ENG_20081121.0093.LDC2009T13	"We have two categories of people in this continent, those who are Afro-optimist and think that nothing is impossible to achieve and others who are Afro- pessimists who perceive to the contrary," he said on Thursday night.
22150	XIN_ENG_20081121.0093.LDC2009T13	Odinga cited a recent case earlier in the year in which the World Bank suspended the funding of major road projects in the country on learning that a former Finance Minister had resigned from the government to pave way for investigations.
22151	XIN_ENG_20081121.0093.LDC2009T13	He regretted that the continent was endowed with untapped resources but was unfortunately the poorest one and only attracted negative publicity from the international media.
22152	XIN_ENG_20081121.0093.LDC2009T13	Odinga told the launch of a local monthly magazine The African Mirror that the foreign press had developed a culture of painting the continent in bad light, hence to correct the anomaly.
22153	XIN_ENG_20081121.0093.LDC2009T13	He decried that the international press had influenced the perception of policy- makers and influence decision-making process in western nations who take advantage of any slight negative publicity to withhold assistance to the continent.
22154	XIN_ENG_20081121.0093.LDC2009T13	"The perception of policy makers and of the general public in those countries is rightfully reflected in their national decisions," he said.
