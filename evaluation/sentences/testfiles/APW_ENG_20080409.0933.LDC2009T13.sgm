DALLAS (AP) -- American Airlines canceled 850 flights Wednesday
-- more than one-third of its schedule -- as it spent a second
straight day inspecting the wiring on some of its jets, the same
issue that caused the nation's biggest airline to scrub hundreds
of flights two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
American canceled nearly 500 flights on Tuesday, stranding
hundreds of passengers. Federal inspectors found problems with
wiring work done two weeks ago, although the airline says safety
was never jeopardized.
</P>
<P>
Tim Wagner, a spokesman for American, said cancellations could
continue beyond Wednesday as the airline works on its MD-80 jets.
</P>
<P>
American uses the MD-80s mostly on mid-range flights,
particularly from hub airports in Dallas and Chicago. Wagner said
208 of Wednesday's cancellations would occur at Dallas-Fort Worth
International Airport and 138 at Chicago O'Hare.
</P>
<P>
At New York's LaGuardia Airport, hundreds of passengers stood in
a check-in line. The airline offered free doughnuts, coffee and
orange juice, but there were few takers.
</P>
<P>
Bishop Bernard Jordan, a Harlem minister, was in a first-class
line trying to catch a flight to Atlanta, where he was scheduled
to preach Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
"It would have been good to know in advance," said Jordan, who
said he has 4 million frequent-flier miles with American and
flies to Atlanta every other week. "I would have booked with
another airline."
</P>
<P>
The Fort Worth-based airline said it would put displaced
travelers on other American flights or those operated by
competitors. Wagner said that because the delays were "within our
control" and not weather-related, American was offering meals,
lodging and ground transportation to affected travelers.
</P>
<P>
American operates about 2,300 daily flights, more than one-third
with MD-80s.
</P>
<P>
It was American's second bout with mass cancellations in less
than two weeks for failing to meet the same wiring rules set by
the Federal Aviation Administration, which is cracking down on
airlines after admitting its inspectors were too lax last year
with Southwest Airlines Co.
</P>
<P>
Since the FAA began looking more closely at airlines' compliance
with safety directives, there have been cancellations at
Southwest, Delta Air Lines Inc. and UAL Corp.'s United Airlines.
The agency levied a $10.2 million civil penalty against Southwest
for using planes that had missed inspections for cracks in the
fuselage.
</P>
<P>
Wagner said an FAA inspector checked several MD-80s Monday and
found that some of the wiring work performed two weeks ago did
not meet FAA standards. At issue: the spacing and direction of
cords used to secure bundles of wires in the planes' auxiliary
hydraulic systems.
</P>
<P>
The airline said flight safety was never compromised, but,
beginning around midafternoon Tuesday, American began yanking
planes out of service so that wiring bundles could be inspected
and stowed properly in the wheel wells.
</P>
<P>
Gerard Arpey, the chief executive of American and its parent, AMR
Corp., apologized for the inconvenience and said the airline was
working to comply with FAA orders.
</P>
<P>
The cancellations and resulting loss of revenue could hardly come
at a worse time for American, which is facing high fuel prices
and a weakening economy that could hurt demand for travel.
</P>
<P>
AMR is scheduled to report first-quarter earnings in two weeks,
and analysts are forecasting a loss of more than $300 million,
according to a survey by Thomson Financial.
</P>
<P>
Jamie Baker, an analyst with JPMorgan, said in a recent note to
clients that he expects airline revenue to decline significantly
beginning in the April-June second quarter due to the one-two
punch of costly fuel and a possible recession.
