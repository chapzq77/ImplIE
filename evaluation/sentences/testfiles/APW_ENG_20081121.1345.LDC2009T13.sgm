Dow up 494 as Obama prepares to name treasury boss
</HEADLINE>

NEW YORK 2008-11-21 23:40:14 UTC
</P>
<P>
Wall Street put a stop to a terrifying decline and stormed higher
Friday as President-elect Barack Obama appeared ready to tap the
chief of the New York Federal Reserve as the next treasury
secretary and hand him the herculean task of righting the U.S.
financial system.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average, which had broken even for the
day until news of the nomination leaked about an hour before the
close, raced upward and finished 494 points higher, a rally of
more than 6 1/2 percent.
</P>
<P>
The outbreak of buying pushed the Dow above 8,000 -- a figure
that would have seemed like a nightmare three months ago but on
Friday was a relief for Americans who have watched their
investments and retirement savings drain away with alarming
speed.
</P>
<P>
In the two previous days, the Dow had lost a staggering 873
points, more than 10 percent of its value, and the broader
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index had sunk to its lowest level
since 1997.
</P>
<P>
The turnaround came when word reached Wall Street that Obama was
likely to nominate New York Fed president Timothy Geithner, 47,
for treasury secretary. Geithner would assume top responsibility
for tackling what threatens to be the deepest recession in a
generation.
</P>
<P>
Financial markets despise uncertainty, and investors were looking
for a clear message from Obama on who will make up his economic
brain trust. Wall Street had been voicing increasing frustration
with Henry Paulson, the current treasury secretary, over his
erratic handling of the federal financial rescue system.
</P>
<P>
"Something needed to be done on the economy," said Ben
Halliburton, chief investment officer at Tradition Capital
Management. "The fact that they've got the team together, maybe
that is going to shorten the period of indecision."
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere, the government continued its efforts to shore up the
financial system. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. also said
it would guarantee up to $1.4 trillion in U.S. bank debt for more
than three years as part of the government's financial rescue
plan.
</P>
<P>
The decision is aimed at breaking the logjam of bank-to-bank
lending. The health of the economy depends on the free flow of
credit, and credit markets cinched up again as the market plunged
earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
The Friday afternoon rally managed to prevent the week from being
one of the few most dismal in Wall Street history. Corporate
mainstays running the gamut from Gap Inc. to Alcoa Inc. and Walt
Disney Co. to Microsoft Corp. surged by double-digit amounts.
</P>
<P>
But it did not erase heavy losses for the week. The Dow finished
down about 5 percent for the five days, and other major averages
suffered, too -- 8 percent for the S&amp;P 500, nearly 9 percent
for the Nasdaq.
</P>
<P>
The Dow finished at 8,046, and the S&amp;P just a hair over 800.
</P>
<P>
But the S&amp;P is still down 46 percent so far this year, the
most since 1931. And there was still plenty to be concerned
about. Citigroup stock took another huge hit -- down 20 percent
of what's left of its value, to close at $3.77 -- as pressure
built on the bank to sell part or all of itself.
</P>
<P>
With the economic bad news piling up, President George W. Bush
signed an extension of jobless benefits that will make sure
millions of laid-off workers keep getting their unemployment
checks as the holidays approach. Congress had approved the bill
Thursday and rushed it to the president before he took a flight
to Peru for an economic summit.
</P>
<P>
Geithner worked at the Treasury Department for 13 years, leaving
in 2001. People close to him say he is motivated by difficult
challenges. Justin Rudelson, a friend of Geithner's from
Dartmouth College, said he asked Geithner in June whether he was
getting enough sleep.
</P>
<P>
"He said, 'Justin, you have to realize, we live for this. We live
for these kinds of crises,'" Rudelson recalled.
</P>
<P>
While a Geithner appointment could remove the cloud of
uncertainty surrounding Obama's economic team has been removed,
there are still plenty of unknowns facing the market.
</P>
<P>
As a result, volatility will remain a major force on Wall Street
for some time to come, said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer
at Harris Private Bank in Chicago. He said worries about marquee
companies from General Motors to Citigroup are unnerving
investors.
</P>
<P>
"What we're seeing is these symbols of American business history
really suffering and prompting investors to call into question
the viability of the system," Ablin said, referring to the
functioning of the broader economy.
</P>
<P>
Investors have also worried about the fate of the Detroit Three
automakers, which are perilously low on cash and asking
Washington for more help. But lawmakers have likely put off a
vote on whether to extend a lifeline until next month and have
asked the automakers for detailed plans about how they would use
the money. The prospect of a bankruptcy filing by one or more of
the companies has added to Wall Street's worries about the state
of the economy.
</P>

Bond prices fell Friday as credit markets eased somewhat
following a freeze-up Thursday. The yield on the benchmark
10-year Treasury note, which moves opposite its price, jumped to
3.20 percent from 3.00 percent late Thursday. The yield on the
three-month T-bill, considered one of the safest investments,
rose to 0.04 percent from 0.01 percent late Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Light, sweet crude for January delivery rose 51 cents to settle
at $49.93 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The
dollar fell against other major currencies, while gold prices
rose.
