QINGDAO, Shandong, Aug. 18 (Xinhua)
</P>
<P>
It took Jonas Warrer and Martin Ibsen of Denmark 19 hours to wait
for the final declaration of their 49er gold medal winners at
Olympic Sailing Regatta here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Athens 49er medalists Iker Martinez and Xabier Fernandez of Spain
took the silver medal and German brothers Jan-Peter Peckolt and
Hannes Peckolt claimed the bronze medal.
</P>
<P>
The Danes crossed the finish line in 7th place in the double
points medal race, enough for them to claim gold with 61 points
overall, and then had to survive a protest lodged by the Race
Committee against them using another competitor's boat.
</P>
<P>
The Danish team were protested by the Race Committee for sailing
the medal race in a boat borrowed from the Croat crew, who were
not competing in the medal race, after the mast on the Danish
49er snapped shortly before the start, according to the
International Sailing Federation (ISAF).
</P>
<P>
After a Jury hearing from Sunday afternoon till 00:50 on Monday
and then continued in the morning, John Doerr, chair of the Jury
panel that heard the hearing, confirmed shortly before midday
that the protest had been dismissed and the provisional results
were made official.
</P>
<P>
"The Olympic Measurement Committee approved the replacement of
the boat and found that it complied with class rules and all
equipment inspections carried out in the Medal Race Quarantine
Procedures," wrote the hearing document. "No penalty will be
imposed, because no advantage was gained by Denmark."
</P>
<P>
"We're happy about how it turned out. Our mast broke 20 minutes
before the competition and we thought we weren't going to make
it. We were lucky in that we borrowed the Croatian's boat and got
to the start line five seconds before the horn," said Jonas
Warrer.
</P>
<P>
Iker Martinez from Spain said they were stuck in the jury room on
Sunday reading papers for hours. When the decision was made, the
first thing that they said to the Danish team was
congratulations.
</P>
<P>
"We were champions in Athens four years ago. We got silver today,
it is still good for us. Not many in the world have two medals,
so we are really happy about that," he said during the press
conference after the awarding ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Sunday, an enthralling medal race provided a dramatic
finish at the Qingdao Olympic Sailing Center with a big swell and
stormy conditions with gusts up of 20 knots and more. The
Austrians led for much of the race, with the Italians in second
and the Australians third.
</P>
<P>
This put the Australians and Italians in a battle for gold and
when the Austrians crashed up, the Australians took the lead and
the Italians capsized, it looked like gold would go to the
Australians. However they capsized close to the finish on the
final run, the Spanish kept their boat upright and crossed the
line in first.
</P>
<P>
Spain totaled 64 points after the medal race while Germany
tallied 66 points.
