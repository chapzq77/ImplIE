<HEADLINE>
AT GEORGETOWN, A PLAYER AND AN IGNOMINIOUS MARK
</HEADLINE>

WASHINGTON
</P>
<P>
For the first time since 1985, Georgetown University has reached
the Final Four of the NCAA men's basketball tournament. Coach
John Thompson III and his assistants have led a swift and
stunning revival of the program in just three seasons, a
timetable so short that even Thompson said it exceeded his
expectations.
</P>
<P>
And while he has been showered with praise for restoring the
program's glory, one of his assistant coaches, Kevin Broadus, is
also reaping the rewards. He was named the head coach at
Binghamton University on Monday.
</P>
<P>
What Binghamton officials did not know, and what few have talked
about amid this feel-good week here, is that Thompson and Broadus
recruited a player to Georgetown who in four years of public high
school in Delaware compiled final grades of F in 12 courses.
</P>
<P>
That player was Marc Egerson, who had a grade-point average of
1.33 in core courses like math, science and English. After
redeeming his academic standing at Lutheran Christian Academy, a
prep school in Philadelphia, Egerson took his stellar on-court
credentials as a two-time state basketball player of the year to
Georgetown.
</P>
<P>
The Hoyas will compete this weekend in Atlanta for a shot at the
national championship. Broadus, meanwhile, will be on the
Georgetown bench before heading to his $205,000-a-year job at
Binghamton.
</P>
<P>
Egerson left the Hoyas in January for personal reasons after
playing in 13 games. He has since transferred to the University
of Delaware.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Thompson avoided one question about Egerson, then
brushed off a follow-up query by saying: "You move on. He's going
to be extremely successful where he is right now." (Egerson was
on spring break and could not be reached for comment.)
</P>
<P>
Binghamton Athletic Director Joel Thirer said in a telephone
interview on Wednesday that Binghamton, which competes in
Division I in the America East Conference, has high admissions
standards for its student body and athletes. That, he said, is
what attracted him to a coach from Georgetown.
</P>
<P>
Thirer said he worked hard to learn about Broadus, but had no
idea of Broadus' recruitment of Egerson and other athletes from
Lutheran.
</P>
<P>
"We legitimately did our homework," he said, adding that Broadus
had received "glowing references."
</P>
<P>
But when told of the contents of Egerson's transcript, Thirer
said: "Georgetown University accepted a kid like that? Wow."
</P>
<P>
A group of senior Georgetown officials carefully reviewed the
circumstances surrounding Egerson's admission last year,
according to John J. DeGioia, the university's president.
</P>
<P>
He also praised the Hoyas' basketball recruiting effort under
Thompson.
</P>
<P>
"I think if you look at the whole picture, and you look at the
folks that John has brought in, I think you will find a deep
resonance with the tradition and the standards and the character
of the program," DeGioia said.
