U.S. House calls for independent assessment of Iraq war by Sept.

<P>
The Iraq Study Group may be coming back.
</P>
<P>
The House of Representatives adopted legislation Thursday to
revive the bipartisan panel of prominent former U.S. officials
who last year said President George W. Bush should change course
on the war.
</P>
<P>
A new assessment by the panel would offer lawmakers an
independent alternative to an administration progress report due
in September. And because the panel is unlikely to suggest U.S.
combat troops remain in Iraq in large numbers, its
recommendations could provide political cover for Republicans who
want Bush to start bringing troops home.
</P>
<P>
The measure was proposed by Rep. Chris Shays, who was hammered in
the 2006 elections for his support for the war. Shays, a
Republican and a political target for next year's elections as
well, says Congress could benefit from an updated assessment by
the Iraq Study Group.
</P>
<P>
"We should remember we went into Iraq on a bipartisan basis,"
Shays wrote in a June 12 letter to Defense Secretary Robert
Gates. Finding a bipartisan solution "will send a signal to our
enemies and friends the United States stands together to confront
this challenge."
</P>
<P>
The House voted 355-69 to adopt the proposal as part of a $34.2
billion (euro25.5 illion) bill that funds State Department
operations and foreign aid. Shays' proposal had already been
adopted by voice vote, but the congressman said he insisted on a
roll call to gauge support among his colleagues.
</P>
<P>
The assessment would no doubt be juxtaposed to a progress report
due in September from Gen. David Petraeus, the Iraq war
commander, and U.S. Ambassador Ryan Crocker. Several Republicans
say if progress is not made by then, they may call for a new
strategy in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Lee Hamilton, the Democratic co-chairman of the Iraq Study Group,
said in an interview Thursday that he is up for the job but did
not want to pick apart the work of Petraeus or Crocker.
</P>
<P>
"There was concern in some circles that we not monitor or pass
judgment on Petraeus or his report in September. I agree
generally with that" because it would make the work "highly
political," Hamilton said.
</P>
<P>
Accordingly, Shays gave the group only a general mandate to
assess the war. It does not set a deadline.
</P>
<P>
In December, the blue-ribbon study group, co-chaired by
Republican James Baker, said U.S. troops' primary mission should
evolve to supporting Iraqi security forces. The group also said
the U.S. should reduce political, military or economic support
for Iraq if the government in Baghdad cannot make substantial
progress.
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, the panel wrote, combat troops could be out by March
2008 if specific steps were taken.
</P>
<P>
Baker was traveling Thursday and not available for comment,
according to a spokesman.
