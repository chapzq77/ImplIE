Court says jury should decide Wal-Mart fight over disgraced exec
benefits

The Arkansas Supreme Court ruled Thursday that a state judge was
wrong to dismiss Wal-Mart's lawsuit to break a retirement deal
with a convicted former executive, saying the world's largest
retailer is entitled to have a jury hear its claims.
</P>
<P>
Wal-Mart Stores Inc., based in Bentonville, Arkansas, wants to
void a multi-million-dollar retirement settlement it gave to Tom
Coughlin, who later pleaded guilty to defrauding the company
through the misuse of gift cards and expense reimbursements.
</P>
<P>
Wal-Mart and Coughlin had signed a pact in which the two sides
agreed not to sue the other for grievances that might come to
light after Coughlin's departure. However, the company said it
discovered Coughlin's fraud after that pact was signed and
believes Sam Walton's former right-hand man was obligated to
reveal his deceit before retiring.
</P>
<P>
"Wal-Mart has sufficiently stated a claim that it would not have
entered the retirement agreement and release had it known of
Coughlin's misconduct," the justices ruled unanimously.
</P>
<P>
Separately, federal prosecutors will argue in a federal appeals
court later Thursday that Coughlin should serve a term in jail.
In October, Coughlin began a 26-month term of home detention.
</P>
<P>
Lawyers estimate Coughlin's retirement package is worth $12
million (euro8.91 million) to $15 million (euro11.14 million).
</P>
<P>
Coughlin's lawyers say Coughlin did not defraud the company while
negotiating his January 2005 retirement after 28 years with the
company.
</P>
<P>
He remained on Wal-Mart's board after his retirement, but by
April of that 2005, Wal-Mart said it was suspending Coughlin's
benefits amid allegations that the former executive used Wal-Mart
money and gift cards to pay for personal items. Coughlin later
pleaded guilty after prosecutors claimed that Wal-Mart had paid
for his hunting trips, hunting dog training, clothes, alcohol and
parts and service for his vehicles.
</P>
<P>
Coughlin pleaded guilty to fraud and tax charges in federal court
and Wal-Mart sued to have his benefits canceled. Circuit Judge
Jay Finch dismissed the suit, citing the pact the two sides had
signed.
</P>
<P>
Wal-Mart lawyer Theodore Boutrous argued before the state Supreme
Court that Coughlin had a duty to disclose the fraud. However,
"He knew that if he told the truth, he wouldn't get a retirement
package. If he told the truth, he would be terminated. And so he
lied," Boutrous said.
