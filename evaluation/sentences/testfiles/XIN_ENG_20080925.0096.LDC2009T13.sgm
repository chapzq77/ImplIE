MOGADISHU, Sept. 25 (Xinhua)
</P>
<P>
Somali Prime Minister Nur Hassan Hussein on Thursday said
insurgent groups that have not been part of the peace talks
between the Somali transitional government and the opposition can
still join in the national reconciliation process.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news conference shortly after returning from
Djibouti where he led a government delegation to the talks with
the opposition, the Alliance for the Reliberation of Somalia,
Hussein said "doors are open" for the groups opposed to the peace
talks with the transitional government.
</P>
<P>
"It is never late for them to join because our doors are open for
every one interested in peace and dialogue," Hussein told
reporters at his residence in Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
A number of insurgent groups have boycotted the peace talks
between the transitional government and a major faction of the
opposition that has controlled much of southern and central
Somalia before their ouster by Somali government troops backed by
their Ethiopian allies in December 2006.
</P>
<P>
The Prime Minister condemned the shelling in the past three day
of Mogadishu airport by the Al-Shabaab insurgent fighters, who
last week threatened to shoot down any plane that lands at the
airport which they claimed is being used for military purposes.
</P>
<P>
He called on local airline companies to restart using the airport
which he said was serving the public. No commercial plane has
landed at the airport since the threat was issued last week.
