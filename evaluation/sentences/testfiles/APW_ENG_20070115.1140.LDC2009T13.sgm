Serbia ' s PM says Russia offers support against any Kosovo
solution unfavorable for Serbia

BELGRADE, Serbia 2007-01-15 18:02:50 UTC

<P>
Serbia's prime minister said Monday that Russian President
Vladimir Putin has offered assurances that Moscow would oppose
any settlement for the breakaway Kosovo province that violates
Serbia's integrity.
</P>
<P>
Vojislav Kostunica spoke in Belgrade after a telephone
conversation with Putin in Moscow. Kostunica said the Russian
leader told him that "the U.N. Security Council cannot support a
solution by the special U.N. envoy for Kosovo Martti Ahtisaari
that is not acceptable to Belgrade."
</P>
<P>
Putin said in September that his country may use its veto power
in the U.N. Security Council if it disagrees with a proposal by
Ahtisaari.
</P>
<P>
Ahtisaari last year mediated mostly inconclusive talks on
Kosovo's future. In a few weeks, he is expected to propose a
solution -- possibly some form of independence -- for the
province. Kosovo's majority ethnic-Albanian population wants
independence, but Belgrade has vowed never to agree to that.
</P>
<P>
A Kremlin statement said that during a Serbian-initiated
telephone conversation, Putin "affirmed Russia's fundamental
position" on the issue of Kosovo -- that any solution must be
acceptable to Serbia.
</P>
<P>
Ahtisaari's widely anticipated but as yet unannounced proposal
would need U.N. Security Council approval before becoming an
internationally accepted solution for the troubled province,
which has been an international protectorate since 1999.
</P>
<P>
"Putin has stressed that a (Kosovo) solution must be derived ...
from the principles of territorial integrity and sovereignty of
existing countries," Kostunica told reporters, reiterating that
Serbia would lose 15 percent of its territory if Kosovo breaks
away.
</P>
<P>
Formally still part of Serbia, Kosovo has been run by a U.N.
mission and NATO troops since the 1998-1999 war there between
Serbian troops and the separatists. The fighting ended when NATO
bombed Serbs and forced them to pull out of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Moscow has not specified what solution for Kosovo it would like
to see, but Kostunica said Putin believes anything without
consent from both sides would "lead to unnecessary conflicts."
</P>
<P>
Russia also suggested that a status decision should not be rushed
and that Kosovo's leadership must do more to protect the rights
of the Serb minority in Kosovo and enable the return of Serb
refugees.
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for Kosovo's predominantly ethnic Albanian
government, Ulpiana Lama, suggested that Kosovo should not be
regarded as Serbian territory.
</P>
<P>
"We want to assure all sides concerned that Kosovo will respect
Serbia's integrity and not make territorial claims over the
Presevo Valley," she said. The valley is another, adjacent
territory with a sizable ethnic Albanian community, but deeper in
Serbia proper.
</P>
<P>
Kostunica thanked Putin profusely for the support, adding that
"Putin's word ... has brought about a turnaround" in debates on
Kosovo's future.
</P>
<P>
The United States has repeatedly signaled to Serbia that it
should drop its opposition to an independent Kosovo.
