Mexico City police chief ousted following botched night club raid

MEXICO CITY 2008-07-09 00:04:34 UTC
</P>
<P>
Mexico City's police chief was forced out of office on Tuesday
following a botched nightclub raid that resulted in the deaths of
12 people.
</P>
<P>
Mayor Marcelo Ebrard said the resignation of Police Chief Joel
Ortega was the first step in a plan to "reconstruct" the police
force. Ortega had held the post since 2004, when he replaced
Ebrard -- who was fired in a different police scandal.
</P>
<P>
The mayor made the announcement shortly after Mexico City's Human
Rights Commission presented a report alleging rampant misconduct
by officials in the June 20 raid on the News Divine nightclub
that it said "created a death trap."
</P>
<P>
A criminal investigation did not find evidence that Ortega had
committed any crime, but he has been the target of harsh
criticism.
</P>
<P>
Ebrard said that he wants to "make major institutional changes"
to the city's police department to avoid such tragedies in the
future.
</P>
<P>
"We have to build a different kind of police force," he said.
</P>
<P>
He appointed Health Secretary Manuel Mondragon as interim police
chief.
</P>
<P>
Officers responding to reports of drugs and underage drinking
blocked the club's lone exit, creating a deadly stampede in which
nine patrons and three police were asphyxiated or crushed to
death.
</P>
<P>
Thirty-nine police and borough officials, as well as the club's
owner, have been charged in the case. The precinct police chief
who led the raid, Guillermo Zayas, faces 12 counts of homicide.
Zayas said in a television interview Tuesday that he's being made
a scapegoat.
</P>
<P>
The raid showed "systematic abuse, mistreatment and negligence by
police," said Emilio Alvarez, president of the city's human
rights commission.
</P>
<P>
"These acts cannot be seen as isolated events," Alvarez said.
"They constitute systematic and institutionalized practices,
which must be eradicated."
</P>
<P>
The human rights commission said police only had one bus to load
up the detained youths.
</P>
<P>
"The lack of buses motivated the decision to block the exit with
a large group of police," causing the youths to pile up in a
narrow hallway where many died, the report stated.
</P>
<P>
The report said 10 women -- eight of them minors -- were forced
to strip for a medical exam, despite the fact they weren't
accused of any crime, and their parents weren't notified or asked
for consent.
</P>
<P>
Alvarez quoted one of the women as saying "not even my mother
sees me nude. Why should other people see me?" A male police
officer was allegedly present during the exams.
</P>
<P>
City prosecutor Rodolfo Felix Cardenas also offered his
resignation on Tuesday, but Ebrard did not say if he would accept
it.
</P>
<P>
Ebrard himself was fired as Mexico City police chief in 2004 when
his force was accused of dawdling while a mob seized, beat and
burned to death two federal police officers.
</P>
<P>
The club's owner faces charges of involuntary homicide for
allegedly overcrowding the club and blocking emergency exits. He
also is charged with corruption of minors for allegedly allowing
youths to drink.
