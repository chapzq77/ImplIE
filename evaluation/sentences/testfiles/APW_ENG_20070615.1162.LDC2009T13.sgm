Hamas on Friday condemned the appointment of political
independent Salam Fayyad as the new Palestinian prime minister as
a "coup."
</P>
<P>
President Mahmoud Abbas announced the appointment in the West
Bank, a day after Hamas defeated forces loyal to Abbas' Fatah
movement and took control of the Gaza Strip. Fayyad, an economist
who is well-respected by the international community, will
replace Ismail Haniyeh of Hamas, who was fired by Abbas on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In Gaza, Hamas spokesman Ismail Ridwan accused Abbas of taking
"hasty and illegal steps" meant to please Israel and the United
States. He said the appointment will divide the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
"This is a political coup and it has serious consequences," he
said.
