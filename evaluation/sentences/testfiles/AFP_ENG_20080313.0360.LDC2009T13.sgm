Two charged with Brit teen murder: Indian police
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Police in the Indian coastal state of Goa confirmed Thursday they
have charged two men with the murder of a British teenager.
</P>
<P>
Police inspector general Kishan Kumar told a news conference that
Scarlett Keeling, 15, was fed with a deadly cocktail of drugs,
raped by one of the men and then left for dead on the Anjuna
beach tourist spot.
</P>
<P>
The two suspects were named as local barman Samson D'Souza, 29,
and Placido Carvalho, an alleged drugs dealer working the beaches
of the former Portuguese colony.
</P>
<P>
The police official alleged D'Souza was seen by a witness "raping
the girl" before "he took the girl towards the beach... then he
assaulted the girl there also."
</P>
<P>
Keeling then fainted and died of a combination of exhaustion,
assault and the drugs fed to her by the two men, he said.
</P>
<P>
Although Carvalho was not present when she died, he was also
charged with murder because of "common intention," Kumar said.
</P>
<P>
Keeling's bruised and partially naked body was found on the beach
more than three weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
Police had initially insisted the girl had drowned in the Arabian
Sea, but a second autopsy demanded by Keeling's mother, 43-year-
old Fiona MacKeown, prompted the murder investigation.
</P>
<P>
In the face of allegations of police incompetence or a cover-up,
Kumar also confirmed a police officer involved in the early
stages of the investigation had been suspended from duty and was
under investigation.
</P>
<P>
Keeling's mother came to Goa from Devon in southwest England in
November with seven of her nine children for a six-month stay.
