Football: 'Old Lady' stadium with a Nazi past
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Vienna, which chose to revamp a 77-year-old stadium rather than
build a new one for the Euro, will host the June 29 final in a
venue that was once the site of Nazi propaganda and racial
experiments.
</P>
<P>
The Ernst Happel stadium, originally named Prater stadium after
the area of Vienna in which it is located, opened in 1931 for the
second Workers' Olympiad after 23 months of construction.
</P>
<P>
A "utopia made of steel, glass and concrete," the sleek structure
by German architect Otto Ernst Schweizer was then considered the
most modern stadium in Europe.
</P>
<P>
The venue, which was home to the celebrated Austrian Wunderteam
of the 1930s, originally held 60,000 at a time when men still
wore hats to games.
</P>
<P>
It was later increased to 90,000 in the 1950s, before standing
places were abolished.
</P>
<P>
Renovated in 1986, the stadium was renamed after legendary
Austrian coach Ernst Happel in 1993 and is now a protected
landmark.
</P>
<P>
But the affectionately nicknamed "Old Lady," which underwent
further restoration in preparation for the Euro at a cost of 36.9
million euros (58.2 million dollars), also served a more sinister
purpose during the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
On May 1, 1934, marching schoolchildren paid tribute to Austro-
fascist Chancellor Engelbert Dolfuss at the stadium, in a pompous
Labour Day spectacle during which he proclaimed a new
constitution, effectively turning Austria into an authoritarian
state.
</P>
<P>
Four years later, on April 3, 1938, the stadium hosted the so-
called Anschluss Spiel, or "annexation match," following
Austria's occupation by Adolf Hitler's Germany on March 12.
</P>
<P>
Staged by Nazi propagandists as a reconciliation between two
parts of the Reich that belonged together, the game - one week
before an April 10 referendum, in which Austrians would
overwhelmingly vote to join the Third Reich - nevertheless saw
Austria defeat Germany 2-0, before an array of Nazi high
officials.
</P>
<P>
A year later on September 10-11, 1939, the stadium took on a new
role as the German Gestapo locked up over 1,000 Jewish men there
on the ground that the prisons were full.
</P>
<P>
Josef Wastl, the then-director of the anthropology department at
Vienna's Natural History Museum, examined some 440 detainees,
taking measurements of their bodies and features for an
"Anthropology of Jews" report, with photos, hair samples and
plaster masks of their faces.
</P>
<P>
The prisoners were sent to Buchenwald concentration camp on
September 30 and business resumed as usual on the following day,
as the stadium once again played host to a football game.
