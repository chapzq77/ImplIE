TPG ends plan to invest in British bank Bradford &amp;  Bingley

Bradford &amp; Bingley said on Friday that US investment group
TPG Capital had pulled out of an agreement to buy about one
quarter of the struggling British bank.B&amp;B had agreed earlier
this month to sell a 23-percent stake to TPG Capital for 179
million pounds (226 million euros, 355 million dollars) as the
British provider of home loans seeks fresh funds.
</P>
<P>
The U-turn by TPG, made because Moody's had downgraded its credit
rating on B&amp;B, is the second blow for Bradford &amp; Bingley
in a week after British investment group Resolution abandoned its
funding plan on June 27.
</P>
<P>
B&amp;B last month announced plans to raise 400 million pounds
after suffering from a property market slowdown in Britain amid
the global squeeze on credit. On Friday the British bank said
that it intended to proceed with its funding plan.
