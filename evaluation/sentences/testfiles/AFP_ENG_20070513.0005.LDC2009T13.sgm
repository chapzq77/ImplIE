Football: Aussies move tie up young star Spiranovic
</HEADLINE>

Australia's bid to prevent Croatia poaching rising star Matthew
Spiranovic has hit a snag after FIFA decided not to give its
friendly match with Uruguay next month official status, reports
said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Football Federation Australia planned to secure in-demand
Spiranovic's loyalty to Australia after interest from Croatia by
playing the 18-year-old defender against the South Americans
here.
</P>
<P>
Spiranovic, who plays with German Bundesliga Nuremburg, has
represented Australia at youth level but Croatian officials have
targeted him to play for them.
</P>
<P>
The teenage defender is eligible to play for both Croatia and the
British national teams through his parents.
</P>
<P>
FFA wants to prevent any repeat of the moves that led Australian-
raised trio, Josip Simunic, Anthony Seric and Joey Didulica to
opt to play for Croatia rather than Australia in recent years.
</P>
<P>
World body FIFA has ruled the Asian Cup warm-up against Uruguay
on June 2 is not classified as a full international match, so
Spiranovic remains vulnerable to offshore offers until he plays
at the Asian Cup in July or in a 2010 World Cup qualifier next
year, Sydney's Sun-Herald newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
"According to the legal department, a friendly match would not be
considered as an official competition," FIFA spokesman Andreas
Herren told the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Spiranovic's agent John Grimaud said it was expected that a
potential call-up against Uruguay would have tied his client to
Australia.
</P>
<P>
"Matthew is 100 percent committed to playing for Australia,"
Grimaud told the newspaper. "He was born in Australia. Croatia is
not on the agenda.
</P>
<P>
"If he makes the starting line-up for Australia against Uruguay,
he will play for Australia for the rest of his life."
</P>
<P>
FFA is keen to head off another Croatian poaching raid after
Simunic, Seric and Didulica all proclaimed allegiance to
Australia -- and attended the taxpayer- funded Australian
Institute of Sport -- before deciding to play international
football for Croatia.
