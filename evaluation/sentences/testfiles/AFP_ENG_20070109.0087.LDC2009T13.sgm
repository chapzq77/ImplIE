<P>
A Brazilian judge on Tuesday revoked a ban on Brazilians' access
to the video website YouTube but also recommended that a video of
supermodel Daniela Cicarelli apparently having sex at a Spanish
beach continue to be blocked.
</P>
<P>
Judge Enio Santarelli Zuliana said in a statement that access to
YouTube was freed up days after a court order to block the
website in Brazil following Cicarelli's suit over the video.
</P>
<P>
The video clip shows Cicarelli, the ex-wife of Brazilian soccer
star Ronaldo, and boyfriend Renato Malzoni in a passionate
sequence on the beach at Cadiz and in the water.
</P>
<P>
The two were filmed surreptitiously by a paparazzi and the video
was posted on YouTube and other websites.
</P>
<P>
The US-based video-sharing website has since removed the video
from its website.
