<P>
World Bank Vice-President for Africa Obiageli Ezekwesil Monday in
Accra said Nigerian federal government should focus on getting
more technical expertise and knowledge from donors to effectively
utilize its resources, instead of mobilizing for more aid from
donors, reported the News Agency of Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
Ezekwwsili said since the country was not as aid dependent as
other African countries, it should focus on getting the right
support, policies and institutions for its development.
</P>
<P>
"Frankly speaking you cannot compare Nigeria with Central African
Republic (CAR) and Guinea Bissau, Nigeria is a regional economic
leader that needs some support," she said.
</P>
<P>
Ezekwesili advised African countries to look inwards to mobilize
a larger part of their resources for development purposes.
</P>
<P>
"Africa can do better by mobilizing its internal resources,
embrace the private sector and create the environment to promote
trade.
</P>
<P>
Africa gets about 35 billion U.S. dollars aid annually from
donors, but most of it comes as fragments spread across many
projects and different donors.
