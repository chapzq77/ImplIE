Golden Globes cancelled over writers strike: organizers
</HEADLINE>

<P>
This year's Golden Globes ceremony has been cancelled, organizers
said Monday, making the star-studded awards show the highest-
profile casualty of the Hollywood writer's strike.
</P>
<P>
The Hollywood Foreign Press Association (HFPA) and broadcasters
NBC announced the decision to replace the show with a press
conference after actors last week vowed to boycott the event in
support of striking writers.
</P>
<P>
The HFPA and NBC said that instead of the traditional dinner and
awards ceremony, this year's Golden Globes winners would be
revealed during an hour long press conference at 6 pm (0200 GMT)
Sunday in Beverly Hills.
</P>
<P>
"We are all very disappointed that our traditional awards
ceremony will not take place this year and that millions of
viewers worldwide will be deprived of seeing many of their
favorite stars celebrating 2007's outstanding achievements in
motion pictures and television," said HFPA president Jorge
Camara.
</P>
<P>
"We take some comfort, however, in knowing that this yearâ€™s
Golden Globe Award recipients will be announced on the date
originally scheduled."
</P>
<P>
The statement did not give further information about Sunday's
awards, which are regarded as a key indicator of likely winners
at the following month's Oscars and are one of the highlights of
Hollywood's awards season.
</P>
<P>
The influential movie industry blog deadlinehollywooddaily.com
reported earlier Monday that stars would still be able to attend
a red carpet arrivals event prior to the press conference.
</P>
<P>
However an unnamed studio publicist quoted by the Hollywood
Reporter trade magazine questioned how many stars would bother
attending a press conference instead of a champagne dinner.
</P>
<P>
"Unless I know my guy is winning, I'm not sending stars in to sit
on a folding chair just to hear someone else's name read out at a
press conference," the publicist told the magazine's online
edition.
</P>
<P>
The fate of the Globes had been hanging in the balance ever since
striking writers confirmed plans to erect picket lines around the
awards show last week.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, the Screen Actors Guild (SAG) announced that its
members would not cross picket lines set up by writers.
</P>
<P>
The prospect of an awards show stripped of its stars immediately
cast plans for the event into doubt.
</P>
<P>
Hollywood screenwriters downed tools on November 5 after the WGA
and the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers
(AMPTP) failed to agree terms for a new contract that expired in
October.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations have foundered over the writers' demands for an
increased share of profits from Internet and new media sales.
</P>
<P>
The two-month strike has forced the suspension of numerous
television series as well as the postponement of work on several
Hollywood films.
</P>
<P>
The dispute has also cast a shadow over plans for next month's
80th Academy Awards, the highlight of the movie industry's awards
season.
</P>
<P>
Last month it emerged that the WGA had barred its members from
working at both the Oscars and the Golden Globes, ruling out the
possibility of granting a waiver to the two awards shows.
