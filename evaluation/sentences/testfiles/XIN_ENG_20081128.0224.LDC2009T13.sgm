BELGRADE, Nov. 28 (Xinhua)
</P>
<P>
A Slovenian-run organization dedicated to the removal of land
mines Friday received another donation for its efforts from the
Czech Republic, the official Slovenian Press Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The International Trust Fund for Demining and Mine Victims
Assistance (ITF) said the 250,000-euro donation will be used to
build a demining center in Georgia and to clear land mines along
the Serbian-Croatian border. An agreement on the donation has
been signed by Czech Ambassador to Slovenia Ivana Hlavsova and
ITF director Goran Gacnik.
</P>
<P>
The donation is the 13th from the Czech Republic to the ITF since
it was founded in 1998. The Czech Republic has already given
almost one million euros for the rehabilitation of mine victims
and for demining efforts in Southeast Europe.
</P>
<P>
The donation was an important contribution to the work of the
international community in finding a long-term solution to the
land mine problem, the fund said.
</P>
<P>
Since 1998, the ITF has raised about 210 million euros to demine
more than 90 sq. km of land in Southeast Europe and help almost
1,000 mine victims through a number of different rehabilitation
and reintegration programs, the report said.
