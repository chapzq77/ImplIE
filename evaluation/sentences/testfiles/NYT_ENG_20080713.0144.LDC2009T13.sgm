GESTURES, IF NOT PROGRESS, AT UNION MEETING

PARIS
</P>
<P>
Leaders of 43 nations with nearly 800 million inhabitants
inaugurated a new "Union for the Mediterranean" on Sunday, meant
to bring the northern and southern countries that ring the sea
closer together through practical projects dealing with the
environment, climate, transport, immigration and policing.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was also an opportunity for President Nicolas Sarkozy
of France to exercise some highly public Middle East diplomacy by
bringing President Bashar al-Assad of Syria out of isolation and
by playing host to a session between Prime Minister Ehud Olmert
of Israel and the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas.
</P>
<P>
The Union for the Mediterranean is Sarkozy's brainchild, but his
original conception was watered down to include all members of
the European Union, not just those along the Mediterranean coast.
The enlargement made it easier for Sarkozy to include Syria and
Israel, that remain in a formal state of war with one another,
and others, like Jordan, that are only notionally Mediterranean.
</P>
<P>
Only Libya refused to attend, and the kings of Morocco and Jordan
pleaded other engagements. But other than Libya, the countries
were represented by heads of state or prime ministers.
</P>
<P>
While initial accomplishments are likely to be vague, the meeting
represented an end to the diplomatic isolation of Assad, who has
been ostracized for his alliance with Iran, for his support for
Palestinian groups classified by the United States and the
European Union as terrorist, and because of allegations of his
country's involvement in the 2005 assassination of Rafik Hariri,
the former Lebanese prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Syria also attended the U.S.-led Middle East summit meeting at
Annapolis, Md., in November. Since then, Israel and Syria have
opened serious but indirect peace talks with Turkish mediation,
and Assad is eager to rejoin the world, especially with a new
American president to be elected this year.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Sarkozy claimed a success when Assad and the new
Lebanese president, Michel Suleiman, agreed to open embassies in
each other's capitals for the first time. Sarkozy said Assad's
agreement "to open diplomatic representation in Lebanon is
historic progress."
</P>
<P>
But Assad was vague about recognizing Lebanon, a country that
Syria has dominated for decades and regards as a Syrian province.
</P>
<P>
"The summit is a nice event, but will the union find an
independent life?" a senior diplomat from a southern country
said. "Sarkozy's original idea was bold, but there's not much of
it left."
