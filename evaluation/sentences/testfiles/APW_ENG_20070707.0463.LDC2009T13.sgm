killing

BEIRUT, Lebanon 2007-07-07 14:06:06 UTC

<P>
The investigation into last year's assassination of a Christian
Cabinet minister points to the involvement of al-Qaida-inspired
Islamic militants, a Lebanese security official familiar with the
case said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon's An-Nahar newspaper also reported that police
investigating the killing of former Industry Minister Pierre
Gemayel turned up evidence that the Fatah Islam group battling
the Lebanese army in northern Lebanon was behind the
assassination.
</P>
<P>
Gemayel was shot dead by gunmen at an intersection north of
Beirut on November 21 last year. His death was part of a string
of other assassinations that are being investigated by a U.N.
commission initially established to investigate the February 2005
assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon's ruling anti-Syrian coalition, including Gemayel's
father, former President Amin Gemayel, have implied Syria was
behind the assassinations -- a charge Syria denies.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese government officials also accuse Syria of backing Fatah
Islam to stir up trouble in Lebanon, which Damascus long
controlled before being forced to leave in 2005 because of
international pressure in the wake of Hariri's death.
</P>
<P>
Damascus denies the claim, saying it considers Fatah Islam a
dangerous terrorist organization.
</P>
<P>
The security official, speaking on customary condition of
anonymity because he was not authorized to give official
statements, confirmed An-Nahar's report and said that "important
progress" had been made with regards to the investigation into
Pierre Gemayel's killing.
</P>
<P>
The official said interrogations of Fatah Islam detainees show
that the al-Qaida-inspired group is involved in the
assassination.
</P>
<P>
He refused to elaborate, saying details would soon be made public
and had already been relayed to the U.N. investigating team.
</P>
<P>
A Lebanese cabinet minister, Ahmed Fatfat, said the involvement
of Fatah Islam in Gemayel's assassination is now "much clearer"
than before, but the investigations were continuing.
</P>
<P>
Asked by the pan-Arab satellite TV station Al-Arabiya if there
were other suspects, he replied: "Unfortunately it looks like it
is confined to Fatah Islam, and, behind it unfortunately, are
hands linked to Syrian intelligence agencies."
</P>
<P>
The exact number of Fatah Islam militants arrested since the
group clashed with the army has not been disclosed. But the
defense minister said last month that about 40 militants,
including some suspected of links with al-Qaida, had been
arrested.
</P>
<P>
Fatah Islam has been fighting Lebanese army troops at the Nahr
el-Bared Palestinian refugee camp since May 20. Authorities also
accuse it of carrying out the Feb. 13 bombings of two commuter
buses in the Christian heartland north of Beirut that killed
three people. The group has denied being involved in these
bombings.
</P>
<P>
More than 160 people, including 84 soldiers, have been killed in
the Nahr el-Bared fighting, the worst internal violence since
Lebanon's 1975-90 civil war. The army on Saturday renewed its
call for the militants inside Nahr el-Bared to surrender to
"avoid more bloodshed and limit moral and material losses,"
according to a statement.
</P>
<P>
The Fatah Islam group, led by a Palestinian refugee, is believed
to be made up of mostly foreign Sunni Muslim fighters.
