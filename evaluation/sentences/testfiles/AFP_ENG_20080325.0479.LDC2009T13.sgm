Emirates may buy Japan's first passenger jet: report
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Dubai-based Emirates Airlines may buy Japan's first passenger jet
airplane, which is being developed by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries
Ltd., a report said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The carrier is in talks with the Japanese company about the
possible purchase of the Mitsubishi Regional Jet, which will seat
70 to 90 passengers, Kyodo News reported, quoting an unnamed
source familiar with the matter.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam Airlines for its part is considering buying about 20 of
the jets, while US and European carriers are also showing
interest in the plane, which could enter service in 2012, it
said.
</P>
<P>
Japan's All Nippon Airways has also said it was considering
buying the new fuel- efficient regional plane if it is built.
</P>
<P>
Japan Airlines has also reportedly shown interest in the jet,
which is billed as the most quiet, light and fuel-efficient model
in its class.
</P>
<P>
If it becomes a reality, the aircraft would be the first
commercial passenger aircraft in four decades -- and the first
ever jet airplane -- to be built in Japan.
</P>
<P>
There was no immediate confirmation of the report. Mitsubishi has
said previously it would decide by the end of March whether to go
ahead with the jet project based on the level of interest among
airlines.
</P>
<P>
Japan's top automaker Toyota Motor Corp. said earlier this month
that it was considering giving its financial backing to the
venture.
