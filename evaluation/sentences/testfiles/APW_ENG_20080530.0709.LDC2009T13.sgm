Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat says that Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Olmert will meet Palestinian President Mahmoud
Abbas on Monday, shortly before Olmert leaves for Washington for
talks with U.S. President George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
Erekat told The Associated Press Friday that the agenda at the
meeting would include efforts to reach a permanent peace
agreement and Egyptian attempts to broker a truce between Israel
and Hamas militants in the Gaza Strip.

<P>
Abbas and Olmert last met on May 5, and in a possible sign of
progress, a Palestinian official said then that the two sides had
exchanged maps that suggest differences over the shape of a
future Palestinian state were narrowing.
</P>
<P>
Olmert's spokesman Mark Regev said Friday that the two leaders
would meet soon, but he would not say if the meeting would take
place before or after the Washington trip.

<P>
Palestinian officials said that U.S. Secretary of State
Condoleezza Rice would come to the region on June 10. They spoke
on condition of anonymity as no official announcement has been
made.
