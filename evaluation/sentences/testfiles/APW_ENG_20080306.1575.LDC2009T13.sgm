LONDON 2008-03-06 23:14:10 UTC

<P>
Bayern Munich all but assured its place in the quarterfinals of
the UEFA Cup on Thursday with a 5-0 win at Anderlecht, and
Marseille and PSV Eindhoven also won.
</P>
<P>
Bayern, in the UEFA Cup after a rare failure to qualify for the
more prestigious European Champions League, handed the Belgians
their worst ever home defeat in the tournament.
</P>
<P>
The win means Bayern is almost certain to reach the next round
after next week's return leg, as is Marseille, which beat Zenit
St. Petersburg 3-1.
</P>
<P>
PSV Eindhoven won at Tottenham 1-0 and Fiorentina beat visiting
Everton 2-0, leaving Bolton, with a 1-1 draw against Sporting
Lisbon, as the only English team not to lose.
</P>
<P>
Getafe won at Benfica 2-1, Rangers beat Werder Bremen 2-0, and
Bayer Leverkusen beat German rival Hamburg 1-0.
</P>
<P>
Four-time European champion Bayern led after nine minutes when
Hamil Altintop hit a shot from well outside the penalty area past
Anderlecht goalkeeper Daniel Zitka.
</P>
<P>
Thomas Chatelle almost equalized for Anderlecht when he hit the
post, but the hosts were reduced to 10 men when Marcin Wasilewski
was sent off with a second yellow card.
</P>
<P>
Bayern striker Luca Toni, who also was booked and will be
suspended for the second leg, then made it 2-0 before halftime
with a volley past Zitka.
</P>
<P>
Bayern brought on Miroslav Klose and Franck Ribery, and the
France winger created a third goal in the 57th for Lukas
Podolski. Klose scored 10 minutes later from another pass by
Ribery, who completed the scoring in the 86th with a free kick
from the edge of the area.
</P>
<P>
Marseille, another former European champion, looks set to make it
to the final eight alongside Bayern after Djibril Cisse scored
two goals to lead his team to victory over the visiting Russian
side.
</P>
<P>
Cisse scored on both sides of a goal from fellow striker Mamadou
Niang to give Marseille a comfortable win, although Andrei
Arshavin provided a late goal back to give Zenit hope.
</P>
<P>
Juande Ramos' chances of winning the UEFA Cup for a record third
straight season took what could be a decisive blow when his
Tottenham team lost to visiting PSV 1-0.
</P>
<P>
Led by the former Sevilla coach, Tottenham already has won one
trophy this season but lost at White Hart Lane to a 34th-minute
goal by Jefferson Farfan.
</P>
<P>
Defender Gilberto, who was making his debut after joining Spurs
in January, gave the ball away to Farfan midway inside his own
half and the PSV midfielder ran forward before curling a shot
past Tottenham goalkeeper Paul Robinson.
</P>
<P>
PSV almost scored another in the 76th when Farfan shot low toward
the corner and Robinson dived to push the ball past the post. PSV
then had a headed goal by Jan Kromkamp disallowed in the 88th for
offside.
</P>
<P>
Fiorentina, Italy's lone representative left in the tournament,
could make the next round after Zdravko Kuzmanovic and Riccardo
Montolivo scored against Everton. Simon Vukcevic equalized for
Sporting in the 69th to secure a draw at Bolton.
</P>
<P>
Scottish league leader Rangers won with goals by Daniel Cousin
and Steve Davis, while Fanis Gekas scored in the 77th for
Leverkusen, and Ruben De la Red and Pablo Hernandez struck for
Getafe at Benfica.
</P>
<P>
Benfica was the livelier team even after the ninth-minute red
card to striker Oscar Cardozo for violent conduct. Pedro
Mantorras replied with a long-range shot in the 76th.
</P>
<P>
The return legs are scheduled for next Wednesday and Thursday,
with the quarterfinal draw held the following day.
