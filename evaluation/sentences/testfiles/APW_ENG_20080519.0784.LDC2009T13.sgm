Double-amputee sprinter Pistorius says London Olympics may be
more realistic than Beijing

JOHANNESBURG, South Africa 2008-05-19 15:35:46 UTC

<P>
Double-amputee sprinter Oscar Pistorius believes he may have a
more realistic chance of qualifying for the 2012 London Olympics
than this summer's Beijing Games.
</P>
<P>
Pistorius returned to South Africa after the Court of Arbitration
for Sport overturned an IAAF ruling that barred him from
competing in the Olympics and other able-bodied events. The court
said the 21-year-old's carbon fiber racing blades do not give him
an unfair advantage over able-bodied runners.
</P>
<P>
Pistorius said Monday he will be competing in able-bodied meets
to try to qualify for the Aug. 8-24 Beijing Games, but
acknowledged it will be difficult to get into the proper shape.
He said the London Olympics also are in his plans.
</P>
<P>
"The last five months have been extremely tiring," Pistorius
said, adding that months of prosthetic testing, overseas travel
and marathon conference calls had hampered his training. "But I
have the opportunity now so I might as well grab it with both
hands."
</P>
<P>
Pistorius holds the 400-meter Paralympic world record of 46.56
seconds, but that time is outside the Olympic qualifying standard
of 45.55. He admits the chance of shedding a second off his time
is slim, and that he is now hoping to qualify for London.
</P>
<P>
"Realistically speaking...I have a better chance of qualifying
there because I haven't had the chance to train," he said.
</P>
<P>
Even if Pistorius fails to get the qualifying time, South African
selectors could add the University of Pretoria student to the
Olympic 1,600-meter relay squad.
</P>
<P>
"That chance still exists," said Peet van Zyl, Pistorius' agent.
"But the South Africa team needs to qualify."
</P>
<P>
Pistorius would not require a qualifying time and could be taken
to Beijing as an alternate. Six runners can be picked for the
relay squad, which would need to be one of the world's top 16
teams to participate in the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
Pistorius, smiling broadly as he sat behind a table in a black
suit, told reporters that he'd jump at the chance to join the
relay team.
</P>
<P>
"I'd be extremely happy," he said. "It's always been a dream of
mine."
</P>
<P>
Pistorius will run in five Paralympic races in May and June, van
Zyl said. He'll be competing in able-bodied competitions on July
2 in Milan, Italy, on July 11 in Rome, and July 16 in Lucerne,
Switzerland. He will likely add one or two more able-bodied races
depending in his schedule.
</P>
<P>
Pistorius was born without fibulas -- the long, thin outer bone
between the knee and ankle -- and was 11 months old when his legs
were amputated below the knee.
</P>
<P>
In January, the IAAF banned Pistorius from competing
internationally with able-bodied athletes. The body based its
decision on studies by German professor Gert-Peter Brueggemann,
who said the J-shaped "Cheetah" blades were energy efficient, and
could give Pistorius a possible advantage.
</P>
<P>
Pistorius' lawyers countered with independent tests conducted by
a team led by MIT professor Hugh M. Herr that claimed to show he
doesn't gain any advantage over able-bodied runners.
</P>
<P>
At first, Pistorius said, his court battle was about his own
desire to compete with able-bodies athletes, but it eventually
became a fight for all amputee athletes eager for the same
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
"It's always been a dream to compete in the Olympics," Pistorius
said, "But If I look back at my career and I haven't
participated, it will still be a a dream satisfied."
</P>
<P>
Although Pistorius wished he could have spent the last months
training, he said his long plane rides back and forth across the
Atlantic were a mixed blessing. They gave him plenty of time to
reflect on his experiences, which will be included in a book he's
publishing in July.
