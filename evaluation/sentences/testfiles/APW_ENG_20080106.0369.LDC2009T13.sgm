<P>
British Prime Minister Gordon Brown on Sunday appealed for
Kenya's political leaders to urgently hold talks to end a
political deadlock that sparked a week of deadly riots.
</P>
<P>
Brown spoke after opposition leader Raila Odinga said he was
ready to join mediated talks with President Mwai Kibaki, who he
accuses of rigging the Dec. 27 election to stay in power.
</P>
<P>
"I think Mr. Odinga and Mr. Kibaki both recognize that unless
they make a change, unless something happens that brings them
together, the prospects for Kenya are very poor indeed," Brown
told British Broadcasting Corp. television.
</P>
<P>
"We have been working night and day behind the scenes to see what
we can do to bring the sides together," Brown said.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said he had spoken to Ghanian President John
Kufuor, chairman of the African Union, who he said is expected to
arrive in Nairobi by Tuesday to mediate.
</P>
<P>
"I think there is a chance of reconciliation," Brown said.
</P>
<P>
Britain, the former colonial power in Kenya, appealed last week
for both sides to consider sharing power, but the opposition has
rejected an offer from the president to form a unity government.
