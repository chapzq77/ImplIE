An Australian geologist said Wednesday that high magnitude
earthquakes are likely to hit the Himalayan territory of Kashmir,
but the frequency may not be as high as in the past.

<P>
Clifford David Ollier, professor emeritus at the University of
Western Australia, said more scientific and fundamental research
was needed to clearly determine the probability of future
tectonic events in the region.

<P>
However, the Himalayan region lacked basic scientific research in
seismology, Ollier said. "We need more fundamental information,
which I believe is not available."
</P>
<P>
Ollier was speaking at an institute in Srinagar, the summer
capital of India's Jammu-Kashmir state, after visiting the
earthquake-hit areas in the Indian portion of Kashmir.

"I think there will be more earthquakes of high magnitude in this
region," he said.

<P>
Kashmir is divided between South Asian archrivals Pakistan and
India. In 2005, both sides were struck by a magnitude 7.6 quake,
killing more than 80,000 people and devastating hundreds of
villages and towns, mostly in the Pakistan-controlled portion.

"My study of past one year also shows that we're not safe of
earthquakes," said M. I. Bhat, head of the Geology Department at
University of Kashmir. "Unfortunately, we don't have worthwhile
geological maps of Kashmir which could have acted as reference
for research in active tectonic."
