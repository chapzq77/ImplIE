Struggling US automakers ask Washington for more help
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Leaders of the struggling US auto industry were in Washington
Thursday asking for even more help from the government as they
battle to staunch the hemorrhaging of their balance sheets.
</P>
<P>
Congress recently authorized 25 billion dollars in loan
guarantees to help US automakers develop more fuel efficient
vehicles in order to meet upcoming regulations.
</P>
<P>
Ford, GM and Chrysler are now asking for another massive infusion
of low-cost loans, but this time without any strings attached.
</P>
<P>
"It is essential that we preserve our manufacturing and
technology base in this country," said Democratic House Speaker
Nancy Pelosi in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"Today, the Democratic leadership discussed how to protect
hundreds of thousands of workers and retirees, safeguard the
interests of American taxpayers, and use cutting-edge technology
to transform blue-collar jobs to green-collar jobs for
generations to come."
</P>
<P>
She had told the Wall Street Journal Thursday she was open to
providing additional assistance to the automakers as soon as next
month, but insisted said the assistance should be tied to
improving the competitiveness of the Detroit Three.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think you'll see much interest" in helping the industry,
if aid goes toward "doing things the old way," Pelosi said.
</P>
<P>
Executives from General Motors, Ford Motor and Chrysler as well
as the president of the United Auto Workers union also asked
Pelosi to speed up the delivery of the loan guarantees during the
meeting Thursday.
</P>
<P>
To press the case, the automakers planned to go over all the
actions they've taken in the last two years to speed up the
development of cleaner and more efficient vehicles," GM spokesman
Greg Martin said.
</P>
<P>
"Right now, it all comes to a stop if they can't get help for the
industry to get through this period," Martin told AFP.
</P>
<P>
The meeting came a day before GM and Ford were set to report
significant third quarter losses and days after US auto sales
sank to their lowest levels in 25 years.
</P>
<P>
The Detroit Three have already undertaken several massive
restructuring programs in response to a steady loss of market
share to Asian competitors.
</P>
<P>
That loss accelerated in recent years as high fuel prices shifted
demand away from the gasoline-guzzling trucks and sport utility
vehicles which had propped up their profits.
</P>
<P>
Then the credit crunch hit and auto sales plummeted as even
consumers with good credit found it hard to get loans, as did the
automakers whose credit ratings have fallen deeply into junk
status amid bankruptcy fears.
</P>
<P>
General Motors has lost nearly 70 billion dollars from 2005
through the first half of this year while Ford's losses since
2006 topped 24 billion over the same period.
</P>
<P>
Chrysler is privately owned but like Ford and GM has been losing
billions and laying off large chunks of its workforce.
</P>
<P>
The current cash burn poses a real threat to the survival of the
automakers, said Dave Cole, chairman of the Center For Automotive
Research.
</P>
<P>
"The likelihood of one or two of the Detroit Three manufacturers
ending operations is very real," Cole said.
</P>
<P>
"To permit any of the Detroit Three manufacturers to collapse
would scar the US economy further at a time when it can ill
afford another blow."
</P>
<P>
Cole said a bailout would cost the government less than what it
would spend on paying the unemployment benefits of the tens of
thousands of workers who could lose their jobs.
</P>
<P>
"As policymakers consider their positions on assistance to the
auto industry, they must decide, is an ounce of prevention indeed
worth a pound of cure," Cole said.
</P>
<P>
But it's still unclear how much help the automakers will get and
what form it will take, said Laurie Felax-Harbour of the Harbour-
Felax Group.
</P>
<P>
"I expect they will do something," she said. "But everybody is
wondering what the plan is going to be," she said.
</P>
<P>
It is likely that any bailout would kill a potential merger of GM
and Chrysler, she said.
</P>
<P>
Both the UAW and the senior senator from Michigan have openly
opposed the merger which could result in the loss of an estimated
30,000 to 35,000 jobs at Chrysler and an untold number at General
Motors.
