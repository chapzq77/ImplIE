Britain's prestigious Eton College confirmed Friday it was
holding an inquiry after newspapers reported four pupils were
suspended over the alleged mugging of a 13-year-old girl on its
playing fields.

The girl reportedly claimed her handbag had been stolen and she
had broken at least one rib in the incident at the elite school,
whose former pupils include Princes William and Harry and 18
British prime ministers.

One of the four boys, all aged 13 and 14, is believed to have
dropped his trousers in front of the girl, according to The Times

British politician.

College," the spokesman, who was not named in line with force
policy. "If a complaint is made it will be investigated
thoroughly."

The school said Friday it had begun an investigation to find out
what had happened. "When we are sure, we shall take whatever

comment in detail on matters affecting individual pupils," the
