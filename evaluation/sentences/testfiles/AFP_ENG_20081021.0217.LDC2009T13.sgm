Football: Newcastle's Beye claims his innocence
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Newcastle defender Habib Beye has claimed his tackle against
Manchester City which cost him his place against Sunderland this
Saturday was a good one and did not merit a sending off.
</P>
<P>
Newcastle have launched an appeal against 31-year-old Beye's red
card in the 2-2 Premiership draw against City at St James Park on
Monday night.
</P>
<P>
Senegal's Beye received a 12th-minute dismissal for a challenge
on Brazil star star Robinho and referee Rob Styles awarded a
penalty although replays showed Beye had played the ball.
</P>
<P>
The Football Association was on Tuesday awaiting the referee's
report, but the defender insisted he had been cruelly punished.
</P>
<P>
Beye said: "For me, that was the start of my season and I am
devastated by the decision.
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't have made the tackle if I didn't think I could have
got the ball, and that's why I am so disappointed.
</P>
<P>
"It was my first game back for some time after my injury, and to
be sent off so early is very disappointing."
</P>
<P>
Styles late last month apologised to Bolton for the penalty
decision that condemned them to a 2-0 defeat against Manchester
United.
