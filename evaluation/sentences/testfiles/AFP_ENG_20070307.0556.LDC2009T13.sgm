British lawmakers back fully elected House of Lords
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
British lawmakers voted Wednesday to reform the upper chamber of
parliament, the House of Lords, to make it fully elected for the
first time in its 600-year existence.
</P>
<P>
Members of the lower House of Commons voted by a margin of 113
votes for what would constitute a complete overhaul of the House
of Lords and pave the way for one of Britain's most radical
constitutional changes.
</P>
<P>
The vote, which passed 337 to 224, will not pass into law, but
the result is expected to inform government thinking when it
draws up legislation for reform later this year.
</P>
<P>
MPs also voted by a majority of 280 to remove the remaining
hereditary peers from the House of Lords. Hereditary peers
survived Blair's first attempt to reform the chamber in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Commons leader Jack Straw presented MPs with a total of nine
options by the government, all of which they could back or
reject.
</P>
<P>
Among the options rejected were abolishing the second chamber
altogether; a fully-appointed Lords; and partially-elected
options at 20, 40, 50 and 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
They did back a proposal for an 80 percent elected House of Lords
but by a margin of only 38 votes -- significantly smaller than
the vote backing totally elected chamber.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Tony Blair's government had favoured a 50 percent
elected chamber.
</P>
<P>
Blair himself voted in favour of a 50-50 split between elected
and appointed peers (members of the House of Lords) but did not
take part in the other votes, his office said.
</P>
<P>
A previous vote on reforming the House of Lords in 2003 ended in
stalemate after lawmakers rejected all the options on offer.
Blair backed keeping a wholly- appointed second chamber.
</P>
<P>
A police probe was launched last year into whether Blair's Labour
and other parties illegally offered seats in the Lords in return
for financial donations -- the "cash for honours" row which is
plaguing his last weeks in power.
</P>
<P>
Straw said Wednesday's vote was a "historic step forward on an
issue which has been a matter of debate for decades" which could
transform the Lords into a more dynamic and active law-making
body.
</P>
<P>
The Lords scrutinises and revises government legislation but is
often seen by the public as an undemocratic "retirement home" for
former MPs or a place for the privileged titled classes or
political appointees.
</P>
<P>
"The House of Commons has broken the deadlock. It is a dramatic
result in the history of the British Parliament," Straw said.
</P>
<P>
The Lords itself will vote on the issue next week, he added. The
government will then consider its next move in discussion with
all parties.
</P>
<P>
But already opponents assessed that very little will happen.
</P>
<P>
The former leader of the main opposition Conservative Party, Iain
Duncan Smith, said the vote for a fully-elected chamber was a
"brilliant parliamentary tactic" designed to muddy the waters on
reform.
</P>
<P>
The vote came amid claims from a Labour peer in the House of
Lords, Lord David Lipsey, that making it an elected body could
cost more than one billion pounds (1.5 billion euros, 1.9 billion
dollars) per term.
</P>
<P>
The former economics editor of the weekly Sunday Times newspaper
said this "plausible" estimate, based on official figures, was a
conservative one and could rise with inflation.
</P>
<P>
The government, which refused to include costs in its initial
white paper proposals, dismissed the figures as "preposterous...
back-of-an-envelope calculations."
</P>
<P>
Currently about 746 peers can sit, speak and vote in the House of
Lords, which dates back to the 14th century. Some 615 of them
have been appointed for life and 92 inherited their seats.
</P>
<P>
It also features 26 Church of England archbishops and bishops and
12 Law Lords -- members of Britain's highest appeal court.
