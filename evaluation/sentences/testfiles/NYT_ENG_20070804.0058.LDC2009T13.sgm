DRAWING FIRE, JUDITH GIULIANI GIVES HER SIDE
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It has not been an easy few months for Judith Giuliani. Her
rollout to the public received rocky reviews from the political
class, Republicans included. A series of negative articles about
her shopping habits, marital past and supposedly testy relations
with campaign staff followed. Her appearances alongside her
husband, Rudolph W. Giuliani, grew suddenly scarce -- and some
analysts suggested that she keep it that way.
</P>
<P>
So it was perhaps no surprise that at a recent lunch in downtown
Manhattan, Judith offered this self-assessment: "When it comes to
politics, I'm new to this."
</P>
<P>
Over the course of a two-hour interview, Judith Giuliani, 53,
talked for the first time about how she met Rudolph Giuliani and
about their first date. (He asked her out, she said.) But she
returned again and again to her inexperience as a political wife,
saying, "It's a learning curve for me."
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure that's something that can get one into, you know -- "
She did not finish the thought, but allowed her hands to flutter
cautiously before going on. "But I try to remain me. And again,
part of that is not doing anything more than I have to in terms
of making myself in any way a distraction from what my husband is
trying to do for America."
</P>
<P>
Not becoming a distraction to her husband, a front-runner for the
Republican presidential nomination, appears to be an elusive
goal. A daughter of small-town Pennsylvania, a former nurse and
working mother who struggled to raise a child on her own, she
cuts a figure that Rudolph Giuliani's aides say will appeal to
Republican voters. Husband and wife agree that Laura Bush is a
model for Judith Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
But Judith Giuliani carries some distinctly un-Laura baggage.
Like her husband, she has been married twice before. They also
had a secret affair for a year before Rudolph Giuliani announced
it to the world -- and to his second wife, Donna Hanover -- at a
news conference.
</P>
<P>
Her relations with Rudolph Giuliani's children by Hanover are by
all accounts deeply strained, despite her efforts at
rapprochement. And his son and daughter, ages 21 and 17, have
said they do not plan to campaign for their father.
</P>
<P>
Sharply critical articles, most recently in Vanity Fair, have
described Judith Giuliani as an imperious striver who shops
extravagantly, demands a separate seat on the campaign plane for
her Louis Vuitton handbag and has compiled a hit list of campaign
aides she wants fired.
</P>
<P>
Now, with his wife's public role scaled back, at least
temporarily, strategists are asking dueling questions: Can he win
over socially conservative voters if his wife is not by his side?
Can he win them over if she is?
</P>
<P>
To Judith Giuliani's husband and friends, the scrutiny and
criticism have been quite unfair. And largely in response to the
spate of bad press, both Rudolph Giuliani and his wife made
themselves available in recent weeks to present their side of her
story. In coordinated but separate interviews, the couple talked
in detail for the first time in months about their relationship
and the complications it poses for his campaign.
</P>
<P>
In one of his interviews, Rudolph Giuliani acknowledged that his
wife was a political neophyte whose background has "not been
every day having a press conference." But he described her as an
effective fundraiser and trusted sounding board for his policies,
particularly on health care, because she holds a two-year nursing
degree and once sold pharmaceuticals. (He praised her mastery of
"the way a surgical procedure is done or the way in which you
seal a Level 1 trauma center off for a biological agent.")
</P>
<P>
He also said she has good relations with people inside his
campaign, and he rejected descriptions of his wife as high-handed
or high society. "Judith loves to go out and loves to be with
people," he said. "But she is not one of those people that
constantly has to socialize."
</P>
<P>
While Rudolph Giuliani stopped short of saying he would invite
her to Cabinet meetings -- as he told Barbara Walters on "20/20"
in March -- he said she does attend "about a quarter" of the
campaign's political discussions and advises him on major
personnel matters because she has "great instincts for being able
to judge people."
</P>
<P>
She participated, for instance, in her husband's interview with
Michael DuHaime for the position of campaign manager. And she
concurred with the decision to hire him, Rudolph Giuliani said.
</P>
<P>
"She's involved, but she's not overly involved," he said. "She's
usually involved when I ask her to be -- and in things that she
has an interest in."
</P>
<P>
But when asked how visible he expects his wife to be on the
campaign trail, Rudolph Giuliani hesitated, then managed a
noncommittal reply.
</P>
<P>
"I'd say reasonably visible?" he said.  (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
Judith Nathan became a part of Rudolph Giuliani's life in 1999,
not long before his prostate cancer was diagnosed. The
circumstances of their meeting have been the subject of much
contention, with some critics suggesting that she aggressively
pursued him at a time when he was New York City's mayor and still
living in Gracie Mansion with Hanover and their children.
</P>
<P>
Until now, the Giulianis have declined to discuss the matter,
calling it "a romantic secret." But in the interviews, the couple
provided their version of their introduction, saying they met at
Club Macanudo, a cigar bar on E. 63rd Street, in May 1999. They
said they were introduced by Burt Meyers, a specialist in
infectious diseases at Mount Sinai Hospital who was there with
Nathan and had met Rudolph Giuliani when his mother was a patient
there.
</P>
<P>
After chatting for an hour, mostly about her work in the
pharmaceutical industry, Rudolph Giuliani asked for her phone
number, they said. "She gave me a piece of paper to write it on,"
he recalled. "One of our other romantic little secrets is I've
kept it all these years in my wallet."
</P>
<P>
After they began dating, Judith Giuliani had plans to fly to
Hawaii on a vacation awarded to leading sales managers by her
employer.
</P>
<P>
"He said, 'Please don't go,"' she recalled. "'You've already
become too important to me."'
</P>
<P>
Judith Giuliani declined to comment when asked how she felt about
dating a married man, or the complications involved in seeing him
secretly.
</P>
<P>
Rudolph Giuliani said: "I don't discuss that in detail except to
say that, you know, we love each other very much, and we have
both found the person that we adore and can live with the rest of
our lives. It didn't happen for either of us young in life."
</P>
<P>
Through her spokeswoman, Hanover, Rudolph Giuliani's ex-wife,
declined to comment for this article.
</P>
<P>
Judith Giuliani grew up as Judi Stish in Hazleton, Pa., a coal-
mining town, the second of three children. Her father, whose
forebears came from Italy -- the family's name had been Sticia --
was a circulation manager for The Philadelphia Inquirer.
</P>
<P>
After she graduated from St. Luke's School of Nursing in
Bethlehem, Pa., she worked for several months as a hospital
nurse, then took a sales job for U.S. Surgical, a medical
equipment company, where her first husband, Jeffrey Ross, also
worked.
</P>
<P>
Judith Giuliani's second husband, Bruce Nathan, was a wallpaper
salesman from Long Island. They adopted a girl, Whitney, lived in
Atlanta, Manhattan and Southern California, and split bitterly in
1992. She returned with their daughter to Manhattan, took
computer and business classes at night at New York University and
eventually moved into the cramped East Side apartment of a
psychologist she was dating, Manos Zacharioudakis.
</P>
<P>
Sometimes, when she could not find a baby sitter, she took her
daughter to class. The experience, she said, helped her
understand the struggles of working women and single mothers.
From 1993 until 2001, she worked her way up in the hospital sales
division of Bristol-Myers Squibb.
</P>
<P>
The Giulianis were married by Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg in May
2003, on the lawn of Gracie Mansion. Among their 400 guests were
Henry A. Kissinger, Yogi Berra, Vera Wang, and Joseph Volpe, the
general manager of the Metropolitan Opera.
</P>
<P>
Judith Giuliani's initial period of involvement in her husband's
campaign -- she called it "being rolled out publicly"-- began
with a couple of gentle, staged events in the spring. She was
profiled in the March issue of Harper's Bazaar and photographed
wearing a Ralph Lauren Collection jacket, a Celine dress and
Graff diamonds. (A caption read, "Judith Giuliani epitomizes
laid-back elegance.") In late March, she and Rudolph Giuliani
clasped hands and kissed throughout their interview with Walters,
in which the former mayor said that "to the extent she wants to
be," his wife would be involved in policy decisions and could sit
in on Cabinet meetings.
</P>
<P>
His comment drew derision from those who said she lacked the
expertise to attend high-level policy meetings, and the remark
overshadowed the rest of the interview. The rollout rolled
downhill from there.
</P>
<P>
The New York Daily News discovered that Judith Giuliani had been
married twice before -- not once, as had been generally believed.
The New York Times reported that Rudolph Giuliani had become
estranged from his children and that Judith Giuliani was, in
large part, the reason.
</P>
<P>
A March 14 clip of Judith Giuliani going on at length about her
own credentials as she introduced her husband at a fundraiser
began circulating on YouTube. And on April 2, The New York Post
reported that sales workers at Judith Giuliani's old employer,
U.S. Surgical, often demonstrated staplers on dogs that were
subsequently put to death.
</P>
<P>
Although Judith Giuliani's friends say the coverage has been
painful, the Giulianis tried to brush off the difficulties. "I
don't want to sit in on Cabinet meetings," Judith Giuliani said.
"He offered me that because he loves me. You know, he says he
respects my intelligence."
</P>
<P>
But she remains uncomfortable talking about his campaign. In the
interview, she grew most animated when talking about golfing with
Rudolph Giuliani -- she plays, on average, about a stroke below
him -- and medical subjects. "I'm really happy to talk to you
about staphylococcus and streptococcus," she said.
</P>
<P>
Rudolph Giuliani called her the "rookie of the year" as a
candidate spouse. But he candidly acknowledged that his, and her,
complicated marital resumes might be liabilities among some
Republican voters.
</P>
<P>
"Any candidate that's lived a long life is going to have made a
certain number of mistakes," he said. "For some people, this'll
make it difficult, if not impossible, for them to vote for me."
