German metalworkers step up strikes amid recession fears
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Thousands of German metal and electronics workers stepped up
industrial action Monday as they pressed for pay hikes, adding
pressure to firms already hit by a global economic slowdown.
</P>
<P>
In four out of Germany's 16 states alone -- Hesse, Rhineland-
Palatinate, Saarland and Thuringia -- around 30,000 workers were
called on to stage warning strikes, trade union IG Metall said.
</P>
<P>
Automakers, already hit hard by the global slowdown, were at the
forefront of the strikes, with 2,600 workers at a Mercedes van
factory in Duesseldorf temporarily stopping work overnight and on
Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
Other protest actions were also set to hit plants run by Ford and
General Motors's Opel unit, as well as at auto parts maker Bosch,
according to IG Metall, Germany's biggest and most powerful
industrial union.
</P>
<P>
IG Metall is seeking an eight percent pay increase -- the highest
the union has demanded in 16 years -- for 3.6 million metal and
electronics workers.
</P>
<P>
Employers have offered 2.1 percent from January 1 plus a one-off
payment for November and December.
</P>
<P>
The government last month slashed its 2009 growth forecast to
just 0.2 percent amid weakening demand for goods from the world's
biggest exporter, the slowest rate of growth since the 2003
recession when output shrank 0.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission on Monday said it foresaw no growth at
all in Europe's biggest economy next year.
</P>
<P>
It also forecast a short shallow recession for the 27-nation EU,
predicting the bloc's combined economy would shrink 0.1 percent
in both the third and fourth quarters of 2008.
</P>
<P>
Chancellor Angela Merkel's government is to unveil a package of
measures Wednesday to help head off a looming recession.
