MUMBAI, India 2008-04-22 13:43:45 UTC

<P>
A laboratory technician who allegedly tried to make a quick buck
by stealing samples from the sperm bank where he worked has been
arrested after a suspicious doctor tipped off police.
</P>
<P>
S. Mohite, a laboratory worker at Cryobank in Aurangabad city in
western India, and a relative, Anil Mohite, tried to sell 101
vials of sperm to a doctor in Mumbai for 25,000 rupees (US$625;
euro520), Aurangabad police chief K. L. Bishnoi said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The doctor declined -- then called the police, who arrested the
pair Sunday, Bishnoi told The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
"The doctor contacted police because they (doctors) usually refer
patients to infertility clinics for treatment. They are never
approached with sperm vials on sale," said Bishnoi.
</P>
<P>
Mohite "must have thought he would steal the sperm and establish
his own contacts to sell the vials," Bishnoi said.
</P>
<P>
Cyrobank could not immediately be contacted for comment.
</P>
<P>
Infertility experts in Mumbai were astounded by the alleged
theft.
</P>
<P>
"Bizarre is the word that comes to mind," said Dr. Aniruddha
Malpani. "Anyone would have a hard time selling sperm vials. They
must be stored in a liquid nitrogen container. It doesn't make
any sense."
</P>
<P>
Malpani said infertility clinics have their own sperm banks and
that patients are referred to the clinics by gynecologists.
</P>
<P>
"An unlabeled vial is worse than useless," Malpani said.
</P>
<P>
Most clinics pay registered sperm donors about 5,000 rupees
(US$125; euro104) for 10 samples, comprising 20 vials.
</P>
<P>
The Mohites will be charged with stealing and cheating, and each
face up to seven years in prison if convicted, Bishnoi said.
