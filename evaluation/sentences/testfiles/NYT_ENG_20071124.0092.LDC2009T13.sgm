</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At his old job, Chris Hart lured businesses to Florida.
</P>
<P>
Now he's working the other side of the fence, making sure those
businesses can find decent workers once they get here.
</P>
<P>
Hart, a former state legislator with deep roots in Tampa, became
president of Workforce Florida in Tallahassee this month. His
task? Move the state's workers like they're pieces of a jigsaw
puzzle: out of struggling industries and into fields that are
growing, better paid and higher skilled.
</P>
<P>
Hart, 39, joins Workforce Florida from Enterprise Florida,
another public-private organization aimed at economic
development. Here are excerpts from his interview last week with
the St. Petersburg Times:
</P>
<P>
Why do we need an agency
</P>
<P>
like Workforce Florida?
</P>
<P>
When a business is looking to come to Florida, the first question
they always ask us is about the work force. "What does your work
force look like? Are they educated the way I need them to be
educated? Do they have the certifications I need?"
</P>
<P>
The way the world used to work, people went where the businesses
were. Now, the businesses go where the talent is.
</P>
<P>
Do out-of-state companies worry that Florida's talent is second
rate?
</P>
<P>
I don't think we're seen as second rate at all. It isn't (about)
trying to bring us up to par with other states and other
countries, but to kind of look over the horizon (at demographic
changes, emerging industries, etc.) to decipher what training is
going to be needed to support the next activity.
</P>
<P>
What are those next big activities? What industries are going to
create a lot of jobs here?
</P>
<P>
The energy industry  from line workers to plant workers and
everything up and down the channel. There are several programs
that are already in motion (to train energy workers): There's an
Employ Florida Banner Center for energy at Lake-Sumter Community
College that got under way this past spring. (The Banner Centers,
which Workforce Florida rolled out last year, are state-funded
programs that train workers in growing industries like aerospace,
biotechnology and manufacturing.) There's also a Banner Center at
UCF for alternative energy (in the works).
</P>
<P>
What else?
</P>
<P>
The other area that we're looking at is space. The space shuttle
by 2010 will no longer be in existence (according to NASA's
plans). The next generation of spacecraft will need fewer
workers. That gives us a great opportunity, because we have some
of the smartest people  they really are rocket scientists  who
are now available.
</P>
<P>
What are you going to
</P>
<P>
do with all those rocket
</P>
<P>
scientists?
</P>
<P>
We're working with Enterprise Florida and Space Florida  they can
help point out what businesses they (the scientists) can go to.
</P>
<P>
What about the Tampa Bay area's work force? What's
</P>
<P>
our future in?
</P>
<P>
Tech and financial services. I see the University of South
Florida and Moffitt Cancer Center and the fact that you have a
lot of technology entrepreneurs. SRI is over there now in St.
Pete; they're going to need some of the best and brightest,
they're going to need lab technicians, chemists and engineers.
</P>
<P>
Do we really have that
</P>
<P>
kind of talent here? Jimmy Wales is moving Wikipedia from St.
Petersburg (to San Francisco) because
</P>
<P>
his words!  'you go where the talent is.' I don't think he was
looking hard enough!  Florida is steadily losing jobs in
manufacturing. Does that bother you, or would you say 'good
riddance'?
</P>
<P>
I'd like to see a renewed interest in the state in manufacturing,
but it's a clean manufacturing, a research and development
manufacturing, not an easily copied type of manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
What do you mean by 'research and development manufacturing'?
</P>
<P>
Manufacturing new products and new processes. So mainly, those
workers who are working to develop a new drug, or a new medical
device. They would be manufacturing that not for mass
distribution, because once you get to that point you've
mechanized the process and that's something that you can bid on
price  a lot of that is probably being done offshore.
</P>
<P>
You keep talking about knowledge-driven jobs.
</P>
<P>
What about all our service jobs? Do you want to get
</P>
<P>
rid of them?
</P>
<P>
Some people say they want those jobs to disappear, but tourism
and agriculture are lifeblood in this state, and have been since
the beginning of Florida's existence. They do provide a lot of
jobs, directly and indirectly. That's a big part of who we are.
