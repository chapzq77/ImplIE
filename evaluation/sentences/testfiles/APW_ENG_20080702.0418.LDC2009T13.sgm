AP-Yahoo News poll: People cool to Michelle Obama, unfamiliar
with Cindy McCain

WASHINGTON 2008-07-02 10:30:47 UTC

<P>
The public hasn't taken to Michelle Obama yet, especially whites.
And it's got a question about Cindy McCain: Who is she?
</P>
<P>
People are divided over whether they like the wife of Democratic
presidential candidate Barack Obama, with 30 percent seeing her
favorably and 35 percent unfavorably, according to an Associated
Press-Yahoo News poll released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
They tilt positively toward the spouse of Republican hopeful John
McCain, by 27 percent to 17 percent.
</P>
<P>
In other words: While the two women are about equally liked,
Michelle Obama is twice as disliked as Cindy McCain.
</P>
<P>
"Cindy seems like she's laid back and not trying to run her
husband," said Linda Kaiser, 60, a Republican and church
secretary from Clairton, Pennsylvania. "It's nice to have a
brain, but they should let their husband be president."
</P>
<P>
Whites have an unfavorable view of Michelle Obama by 18
percentage points, while eight in 10 blacks like her. That is
reminiscent of how Barack Obama fared in the Democratic primaries
against Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
In the AP-Yahoo News poll, whites saw Cindy McCain positively by
17 points, while one in eight blacks like her.
</P>
<P>
Michelle Obama does better with unmarried people and college
graduates but is viewed poorly by people age 65 and up. Cindy
McCain is seen more favorably by older people, those who are
married and the more affluent, but she is less well-received by
singles.
</P>
<P>
Cindy McCain is also more of a mystery. Nearly six in 10, or 56
percent, said they know too little to say much about her --
exceeding the 34 percent clueless about Michelle Obama. Half of
Republicans say they don't know Cindy McCain, while three in 10
Democrats say that about Michelle Obama.
</P>
<P>
Barack Obama's wife seems to incite stronger feelings. One in
five had very negative views of her, triple the number who said
so about John McCain's wife. One in 10 had very favorable views
of Michelle Obama, double Cindy McCain's number.
</P>
<P>
"She's African-American, she's highly articulate, she's young and
she seems highly devoted to her husband and her family," said
Edythe Friley, 61, a retired teacher from Detroit. "She serves as
a role model. There's not a parent on planet Earth who wouldn't
want a daughter like this."
</P>
<P>
Michelle Obama has been in the spotlight more than Cindy McCain,
including stories on whether she was trying to reshape her image.
</P>
<P>
Michelle Obama, 44, a lawyer and hospital administrator, took
flak in February when she said she was proud of her country "for
the first time in my adult life."
</P>
<P>
Cindy McCain, 54, heiress to an Arizona beer distributorship,
revealed in May that she earned more than $6 million in 2006
after saying she would never release her income tax returns.
</P>
<P>
The AP-Yahoo News survey of 1,759 adults was conducted from June
13-23 and had an overall margin of sampling error of plus or
minus 2.3 percentage points. Included were interviews with 844
Democrats and 637 Republicans, for whom the margins of sampling
error were plus or minus 3.4 points and 3.9 points, respectively.
</P>
<P>
The poll was conducted over the Internet by Knowledge Networks,
which initially contacted people using traditional telephone
polling methods and followed with online interviews. People
chosen for the study who had no Internet access were given it for
free.
