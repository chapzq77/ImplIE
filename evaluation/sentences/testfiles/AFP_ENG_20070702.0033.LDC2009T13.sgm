Indonesian capital to get tough on polluters
</HEADLINE>

Authorities in the smog-choked Indonesian capital Jakarta have
vowed to get tough on polluters, an environment official said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The mega-city's administration, police, and prosecutor's office,
and the national environment ministry last week signed a pact
aimed at improving their coordination in a bid to crack down on
environmental criminals.
</P>
<P>
"The concerned institutions will set up a joint office where
representatives can sit together and immediately coordinate when
an environmental violation is found or reported," said
environment ministry official Dana Kartakusuma.
</P>
<P>
Kartakusuma told AFP that currently police action in suspected
environmental crimes, such as industrial waste dumping or burning
rubbish, was slow due to a tangle of bureaucracy officers are
forced to navigate.
</P>
<P>
At the moment, cases are first investigated by the environment
ministry and then handed to police. If the police wish to pursue
the case, they then hand it over to the prosecutor's office so an
indictment can be prepared.
</P>
<P>
"With this office, each case can be immediately discussed by the
concerned authorities and immediate steps can be taken.
Basically, it will help reduce the time needed to process any
violations," Kartakusuma said.
</P>
<P>
Jakarta, one of the world's largest and most sprawling cities,
suffers from searing air pollution and its waterways are clogged
with garbage and stinking, stagnant water, posing ongoing health
risks for its population.
