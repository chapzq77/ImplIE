Could Shia LaBeouf Fill Harrison Ford's Fedora?

"Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull" brings
everyone's favorite archaeologist into the 1950s, and although
he remains true to his 1930s serial-hero vibe, he's sharing the
screen with a young costar in LaBeouf who, in his leather jacket,
cuffed jeans and scowl, looks clearly modeled on Marlon Brando
from "The Wild One."

LaBeouf's character has switchblade swagger and wounded eyes and
the intriguing name of Mutt Williams -- Mutt sure makes it sound
as if  he's looking for his lineage,  doesn't it? Harrison Ford
wouldn't touch that question, but he did praise LaBeouf. "He's
young, but he's an old soul, and he's been an actor most of his
life; he knows what he's doing." LaBeouf's career trajectory is
going strong and, who knows, maybe "Indy" director Steven
Spielberg (who was also a producer of the LaBeouf-starring
"Transformers") has found his screen hero for the next two
decades.
