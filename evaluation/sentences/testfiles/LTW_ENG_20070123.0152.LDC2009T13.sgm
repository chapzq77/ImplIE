NEW YORK

An ironworker, a paramedic and an attorney who believe their
illnesses stem from exposure at Ground Zero plan to attend
President Bush's State of the Union address Tuesday night as
guests of New York's congressional delegation.
</P>
<P>
They are among those urging Bush to include Sept. 11-related
health-are funding when he proposes his 2008 budget.
</P>
<P>
John Sferazo, of Huntington Station, an ironworker who worked at
Ground Zero and attributes his reduced breathing capacity and
other illnesses to the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks, said he hoped his
presence Tuesday night will serve as a reminder of the needs of
emergency responders and others.
</P>
<P>
``This tragedy took 3,000 lives and continues to take our lives
today,'' Sferazo, president and co-founder of Unsung Heroes
Helping Heroes, said at a news conference Monday at the World
Trade Center site.

The Bush administration has released more than $50 million of $75
million in federal funding to treat first responders through the
New York Fire Department and hospitals, including The Mount Sinai
Medical Center and Stony Brook University Medical Center. Demand
is so high that the money will run out in the next several
months, said Dr. Jacqueline Moline, director of Mount Sinai's
program, which serves 19,000 patients. A Mount Sinai report found
that nearly seven out of every 10 Ground Zero workers suffered
lung problems.

<P>
A U.S. Department of Health and Human Services official said in
December that the Bush administration planned to report to
Congress on a long-term treatment plan in February, after Bush
submits his budget.
</P>
<P>
Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton, D-N.Y., who has submitted
legislation pegging the cost for long-term treatment at $1.9
billion, said, ``We want the president and members of Congress to
see the faces of those who have suffered because of our
negligence in refusing to take care of the people who responded
to 9/11,'' she said.
