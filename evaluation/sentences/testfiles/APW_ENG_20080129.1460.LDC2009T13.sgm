AP Newsbreak: Study warns Afghanistan risks becoming `forgotten
war '  amid growing violence

WASHINGTON 2008-01-29 23:30:59 UTC

<P>
Afghanistan risks sliding into a failed state and becoming the
"forgotten war" because of deteriorating international support
and a growing violent insurgency, according to an independent
study.
</P>
<P>
The assessment, co-chaired by retired U.S. Marine Corps Gen.
James Jones and a former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations,
Thomas Pickering, serves as a warning to the Bush administration
at a time military and congressional officials are debating how
best to juggle stretched war-fighting resources.
</P>
<P>
The administration wants to re-energize anti-terror efforts in
Afghanistan and Pakistan, where al-Qaida and the Taliban militia
are regenerating. But the United States still remains heavily
invested in Iraq, and officials are sending strong signals that
troop reductions there would slow or stop altogether this summer.
</P>
<P>
"Afghanistan stands at a crossroads," concludes the study, an
advance copy of which was obtained by The Associated Press. "The
progress achieved after six years of international engagement is
under serious threat from resurgent violence, weakening
international resolve, mounting regional challenges and a growing
lack of confidence on the part of the Afghan people about the
future direction of their country."
</P>
<P>
A major issue has been trying to win the war with "too few
military forces and insufficient economic aid," the study adds.
</P>
<P>
Among the group's nearly three dozen recommendations: increase
NATO force levels and military equipment sent to Afghanistan;
decouple U.S. management of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars;
establish a special envoy to coordinate all U.S. policy on
Afghanistan; and champion a unified strategy among partner
nations to stabilize the country in five years.
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary Robert Gates said he was not familiar with the
study's findings, but he struck a more optimistic tone on
Afghanistan's future.
</P>
<P>
"I would say that the security situation is good," Gates told The
Associated Press. "We want to make sure it gets better, and I
think there's still a need to coordinate civil reconstruction,
the economic development side of it."
</P>
<P>
Gates said more troops are needed in Afghanistan, but "certainly
not ours." When asked how many more NATO troops might be needed,
he said that number should be determined by ground commanders.
</P>
<P>
The Jones-Pickering assessment, set for public release on
Wednesday, says the United States should rethink its military and
economic strategy in Afghanistan in large part because of
deteriorating support among voters in NATO countries.
</P>
<P>
If international forces are pulled, the fragile Afghan government
would "likely fall apart," the report warns.
</P>
<P>
The study was a voluntary effort coordinated by the Center for
the Study of the Presidency, a nonpartisan organization in
Washington, as a follow-on to the Iraq Study Group. That study
group was a congressionally mandated blue-ribbon panel, the first
major bipartisan assessment on the Iraq war since the 2003
invasion.
</P>
<P>
While the Afghanistan study has not created the same buzz as the
Iraq assessment, the center's latest findings still probably will
wield political clout because of those involved.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Jones led a high-profile study on Iraqi security
forces, which was used by lawmakers to challenge President George
W. Bush's own assessments. Most recently, the retired Marine
Corps general, known for his outspoken independence, was tapped
to advise Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice on security aspects
of the new Israeli-Palestinian peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Pickering was a longtime U.S. ambassador and a former
undersecretary of state.
</P>
<P>
Panel members include Charles Robb, a former Democratic senator
who served on the Iraq Study Group, and David Abshire, who helped
organize the Iraq study. Abshire is president of the Center for
the Study of the Presidency.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the center decided to initiate the study
after Iraq Study Group discussions made clear that Afghanistan
was at risk of becoming "the forgotten war."
</P>
<P>
"Participants and witnesses pointed to the danger of losing the
war in Afghanistan unless a reassessment took place of the effort
being undertaken in that country by the United States, NATO and
the international community," the study states.
</P>
<P>
Military and diplomatic operations in Afghanistan are of keen
interest to Democratic lawmakers, who say Bush has bungled the
terrorism fight there by diverting resources to Iraq. Lacking the
votes to challenge Bush on the Iraq war, Democrats are expected
to turn their attention to Afghanistan and trying to highlight
missteps there.
</P>
<P>
The Senate Foreign Relations Committee was expected to be briefed
Wednesday on Afghanistan by intelligence officials. On Thursday,
the panel will convene an open hearing, featuring testimony from
Jones and Pickering. Also testifying Thursday will be Richard
Boucher, assistant secretary of state for South and Central Asia.
