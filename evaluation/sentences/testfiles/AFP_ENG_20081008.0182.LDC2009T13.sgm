Canada orders US war resister to go home
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Another US war resister was ordered to leave Canada on Wednesday
or face deportation by the end of the month, a support group said
on its website.
</P>
<P>
"Iraq war resister Patrick Hart, his wife Jill and son Rian were
told that they must voluntarily leave Canada or they will be
deported to the United States on October 30th," said the War
Resisters Support Campaign.
</P>
<P>
Hart is a former sergeant and nine-year veteran of the US
military who served in the Middle East as part of Operation Iraqi
Freedom.
</P>
<P>
After one tour, however, he fled to Toronto in August 2005,
deciding that "he could no longer take part in the illegal and
unwarranted military occupation."
</P>
<P>
More than a dozen US war resisters are fighting uphill legal
battles to stay in Canada, after the first of them was sent home
and sentenced in August to 15 months in prison for desertion.
</P>
<P>
An estimated recent 200 US war resisters, none of whom has yet to
secure refugee status, are currently living in this country.
