Deutsche Bank paying $575,000 fine

<P>
Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. has agreed to pay a $575,000 fine
in a settlement over alleged violations of short-selling rules in
2005 and 2006, New York Stock Exchange regulators said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
It was the largest fine ever levied by NYSE Regulation for
alleged trading violations on NYSE Arca, the sibling electronic
exchange.
</P>
<P>
Deutsche Bank also was censured in the disciplinary action. The
investment firm neither admitted nor denied wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
The regulators said that between January 2005 and October 2006,
Deutsche Bank executed a number of short sales on ineligible
stocks without having borrowed the shares, made arrangements for
borrowing them, or having "reasonable grounds" to believe they
could be borrowed when necessary. The stocks in question weren't
on the firm's list of securities that are allowed to be sold
short in that fashion, the regulators said.
</P>
<P>
That was in violation of securities regulations related to short-
selling, they said.
</P>
<P>
Deutsche Bank also failed to adequately supervise some traders
who engaged in the short sales, according to the regulators.
</P>
<P>
Short sellers bet that a stock's price will fall so that they can
profit from it. They borrow shares of the stock and sell them. If
the price drops, they buy cheaper actual shares to cover the
borrowed ones, pocketing the difference.
</P>
<P>
So-called "naked" short selling occurs when sellers don't even
borrow the shares before selling them, and then look to cover
positions immediately after the sale.
</P>
<P>
"We're pleased to resolve this matter," Deutsche Bank spokesman
Ted Meyer said.
</P>
<P>
Deutsche Bank AG, the German bank that is the investment firm's
parent, rose 89 cents, or 1 percent, to end at $85.61 in trading
Wednesday.
