LIMA, Aug. 18 (Xinhua)

<P>
Peruvian President Alan Garcia on Saturday ruled out the
possibility the earthquake which hit the country earlier this
week could trigger an outbreak of plague.
</P>
<P>
Garcia made the remarks while on an inspection tour of the
southern city of Pisco, 240 km south of the capital Lima.
</P>
<P>
Pisco is one of the worst-hit areas in Peru. An earthquake
measuring 7.5 on the Richter scale hit the southern region of
Peru on Wednesday, leaving at least 510 people dead, 1,610
injured and 16,600 families homeless.
</P>
<P>
Most of the bodies have been pulled out from the rubble and
buried timely to ensure that no epidemic outbreak will occur, the
president said.
</P>
<P>
Calling for calm, Garcia promised to ensure uninterrupted
supplies of food, clothing, medicine, drinking water and other
relief goods.
</P>
<P>
He also assured residents in the quake-stricken areas of a swift
resumption of power supplies.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Chinese Embassy in Peru said a Chinese citizen was
injured in the quake. The man, identified as Liu Bijian, owner of
a Chinese restaurant in Pisco, was later moved to a hospital in
Lima, the embassy said.
