Democrat Barack Obama raked in $25 million (euro18.7 million) for
his presidential bid in the first three months of 2007, placing
him on a par with front-runner Hillary Rodham Clinton and dashing
her image as the party's inevitable nominee.

The eye-popping figure was the latest evidence that Obama, a
political newcomer who has served just two years in the Senate,
has emerged as the most powerful new force in presidential
politics this year. It also reinforced his status as a
significant threat to Clinton, who had hoped her own $26 million
(euro19.5 million) first quarter fundraising total would begin to
squeeze her rivals out of contention.
