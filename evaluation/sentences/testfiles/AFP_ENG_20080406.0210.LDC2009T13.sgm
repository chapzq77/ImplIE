Football: Victorious Inter stop rot at Atalanta
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Inter Milan, who had seen their once seemingly invincible
11-point Serie A lead whittled down to just one, stopped the rot
on Sunday with a 2-0 win at Atalanta to go four points clear with
six games left.
</P>
<P>
Inter were under pressure having won only two of their last nine
matches in all competitions and being knocked out of the
Champions League.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, they had seen AS Roma beat Genoa 3-2 which left them
with a slender one-point advantage to take to Atalanta who
enjoyed an impressive 2-1 victory at AC Milan last week.
</P>
<P>
But Inter responded in style and shrugged off the inury-enforced
absences of Zlatan Ibrahimovic and David Suazo to take the
victory.
</P>
<P>
French international skipper Patrick Vieira headed the defending
champions into a 21st-minute lead despite protests by Atalanta
that their defender Massimiliano Pellegrino had been impeded.
</P>
<P>
Seventeen-year-old Mario Balotelli then celebrated his Serie A
debut with a 74th-minute goal after using his lightning pace to
evade his defenders.
</P>
<P>
The win was Inter's first in four matches following two draws and
a defeat and represented their first victory away from the San
Siro since February 10.
</P>
<P>
"Roma's wins didn't worry us," said Inter coach Roberto Mancini.
</P>
<P>
"Generally speaking, titles are won with a one or two-point
difference. Now there are fewer and fewer matches to play to play
and we have a four-point lead.
</P>
<P>
"If we keep playing like this and winning there won't be any
problems."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Fiorentina remain in fourth place, the final Champions
League qualifying place, after a 2-0 win at home over Reggina to
stay four points clear of AC Milan who defeated Cagliari 3-1 on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Giampaolo Pazzini scored the opener in the 23rd minute with
Adrian Mutu making sure of the three points in injury time.
</P>
<P>
Sunday's late game sees third-placed Juventus, who are 10 points
behind AS Roma with two games in hand, welcome Palermo.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Roma, who slumped to a 2-0 Champions League defeat
to Manchester United at the Stadio Olimpico in midweek, stormed
into a 2-0 lead within the first 17 minutes before Genoa levelled
with two goals in the space of a minute in the second half.
</P>
<P>
However, a Daniele De Rossi penalty 10 minutes from time secured
the three points which will send Roma to Manchester next week for
their Champions League quarter-final second leg clash in good
heart.
</P>
<P>
"We proved that we have real heart," said Roma coach Luciano
Spalletti.
</P>
<P>
"The result was deserved. We struggled, but Genoa play good
football and are in great shape, so that was only to be
expected."
</P>
<P>
Roma, still without injured talismanic skipper Francesco Totti,
were in front after 14 minutes when Brazilian import Taddei
scored from a cross by Max Tonnetto.
</P>
<P>
Montenegro international Mirko Vucinic made it 2-0 with a
20-metre drive three minutes later as Roma threatened to run
riot.
</P>
<P>
However, the second half witnessed a turnaround with Marco Rossi
pulling a goal back in the 58th minute after Roma keeper Doni
failed to gather a shot from Serie A top-scorer Marco Borriello.
</P>
<P>
Honduran international Julio Cesar Leon then levelled at 2-2 just
moments later.
</P>
<P>
But just as Genoa threatened to clinch the three points, Roma
were handed a lifeline when Borriello brought down Taddei and De
Rossi converted the penalty.
</P>
<P>
AC Milan kept up their push for Champions League qualification
with a 3-1 win over relegation-threatened Cagliari.
</P>
<P>
Brazilian star Kaka, returning from injury, opened the scoring
for Milan after just eight minutes with a superb free-kick before
Filippo Inzaghi, also back after a lay-off, grabbed his first of
the night with a header on the half-hour mark.
</P>
<P>
Milan goalkeeper Zeljko Kalac gifted Cagliari a goal in the 49th
minute when he failed to hold on to a Daniele Conti free-kick.
</P>
<P>
Inzaghi, however, added Milan's third in the 69th minute with a
wonderful dribble around keeper Marco Storari.
