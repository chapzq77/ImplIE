Afghan intelligence chief: President was warned of plot to kill
him; bomb kills 18 Afghans
</HEADLINE>

KABUL, Afghanistan 2008-04-29 12:23:52 UTC
</P>
<P>
President Hamid Karzai was warned of a weekend assassination plot
against him, Afghanistan's intelligence chief said Tuesday, while
admitting failings by security services that allowed militants to
launch the attack.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a suicide assault killed 18 people, including 11
police, in an eastern province, officials said. Thirty-six
people, including two Australian journalists, were wounded.
</P>
<P>
Afghanistan's three top security officials lost no-confident
votes but still retained their jobs after Amrullah Saleh told
Parliament the plot to kill Karzai was hatched last month. The
gunmen had rented the hotel room they opened fire from 45 days
before the attack, he said.
</P>
<P>
Karzai and other dignitaries escaped unharmed from Sunday's
assault during a ceremony in Kabul marking Afghanistan's victory
over the Soviet occupation of the country in the 1980s. Three
other people, including a lawmaker, died.
</P>
<P>
Three of the attackers were also killed in a gunbattle with
security forces after the assault, Karzai's government said, but
the Taliban said three other insurgents got away.
</P>
<P>
"We had technical information ... that this work would happen,"
Saleh told a National Assembly session broadcast live on national
television. "We passed this information to the national security
(adviser) and to the president of Afghanistan."
</P>
<P>
Despite stringent measures by security services to protect the
event, "the result is that we failed," Saleh said.
</P>
<P>
An Afghan intelligence official has said about 100 people were
rounded up for questioning after the attack but it is unclear how
many are still being held.
</P>
<P>
Saleh, Defense Minister Abdur Rahim Wardak and Interior Minister
Zarar Ahmad Moqbel were summoned to explain to lawmakers what
happened Sunday.
</P>
<P>
All three lost no-confidence votes against them by lawmakers on
Tuesday, but the numbers were not high enough to press for their
ouster.
</P>
<P>
Before the vote, Saleh said the three attackers had been locked
inside a three-story guest house for 36 hours before they tried
to kill Karzai.
</P>
<P>
He claimed that at the time of the shooting, Karzai was out of
the sight of the attackers, whose view was blocked by a wall.
</P>
<P>
All three assailants died inside the hotel room -- one from a
gunshot wound and two others possibly killing themselves, Saleh
said.
</P>
<P>
Several members of police, the intelligence service and members
of the president's security detail were being questioned for
negligence, while a police officer has been arrested on suspicion
of involvement in the attack, Saleh said.
</P>
<P>
The attack in the Afghan capital underscored the fragile grip of
Karzai's government in the face of Taliban insurgents and raised
questions about its demand for Afghan police and army to take
greater control of security. U.S. and NATO-led troops provide
security in much of the country now.
</P>
<P>
But the White House said it was unfair to criticize Afghan
security forces because insurgents launched an attack.
</P>
<P>
"When it comes to dealing with terrorists like the Taliban or al-
Qaida, they just have to have even ... a little bit of an impact
for everyone to say that they had a big victory," White House
press secretary Dana Perino said Monday.
</P>
<P>
"Tragically, the attackers succeeded in getting close enough to
fire some shots," William Wood, the U.S. ambassador in
Afghanistan, said in a statement Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
It took authorities two minutes to defeat the attack, Wood said.
</P>
<P>
The attack has added to unease in Kabul, which has been spared
the worst of the violence as fighting has escalated between the
Taliban and international troops.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, a suicide attack in the volatile east of the country
targeting counter-narcotics police left 18 people dead, including
11 police, and wounded 36 other people, the Interior Ministry
said in a statement. Taliban claimed responsibility for the
attack.
</P>
<P>
The blast also wounded two Australian journalists, said a
spokeswoman for Australia's Department of Foreign Affairs and
Trade. They were not identified.
</P>
<P>
Maj. Martin O'Donnell, who speaks for the NATO-led International
Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in Afghanistan, said it had
troops in the area of the attack in Khogyani district of Nangahar
province, but there were no alliance casualties.
</P>
<P>
The militants opened up with small arms fire and rocket-propelled
grenades before a suicide bomber blew himself up among a crowd
that was taking cover, he said.
</P>
<P>
"If the goal was ISAF they failed," O'Donnell said of Tuesday's
violence. "But if the goal was to injure and kill Afghans, they
succeeded."
</P>
<P>
Alliance medics were treating the wounded, he said.
</P>
<P>
Abdul Mohammad, a provincial police official, said the bomb went
off in front of the office of the district chief, who was among
those hurt.
</P>
<P>
Militants launched more than 140 suicide attacks last year,
spearheading their violent campaign against the elected
government of Karzai and Western forces that support it.
</P>
<P>
Violence has intensified since the Islamist militia's ouster from
power in a U.S.-led invasion in 2001, killing a record 8,000
people last year, according to the U.N. More than 1,000 people,
mostly militants, have died in insurgency-related violence so far
this year, according to an Associated Press tally of figures from
Afghan and Western officials.
</P>
<P>
In the past two days, Afghan and foreign troops have killed at
least 23 insurgents and wounded 20 others in ground battles and
airstrikes in the south and east of Afghanistan, officials said.
