Berlin mulling measures to attract skilled foreign workers
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Germany plans soon to adopt measures aimed at relieving a
shortage of qualified workers in certain sectors by attracting
foreign candidates, an official spokesman said Monday.Although
the ministry spokesman did not provide details, the confirmation
came after a newspaper said Saturday that authorities were
mulling an "index of worker needs."
</P>
<P>
The report said officials could poll 7,000 companies each month
to determine what kinds of skills were needed in the coming six
months and adapt the granting of work vias accordingly.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Labour Ministry "neither denied, nor
confirmed" the report but acknowledged that the search for a
"control system to identify needs" was "the reflective framework
within which we are proceeding."
</P>
<P>
Government spokesman Thomas Steg said the subject had been
discussed intensively, in particular between the social democrat
labour minister and his conservative counterpart at the interior
ministry.
</P>
<P>
A proposition was expected to be presented to the full cabinet on
either July 16 or 23, Steg added.
</P>
<P>
Certain sectors of the biggest European economy, notably high-
tech firms, are handicapped by a serious shortage of engineers,
programmers and qualified technicians.
</P>
<P>
The national engineering federation said last month that around
100,000 engineering posts were vacant throughout Germany.
</P>
<P>
Measures taken by the government to date have been judged too
restrictive by the business sector and have not noticeably
improved the situation.
</P>
<P>
All the same, the government was expected to extend the period
before which non- skilled workers from Eastern Europe could come
freely to Germany, a measure that German businesses would like to
see abandoned.
</P>
<P>
When the European Union extended eastwards in 2004, Germany
obtained permission to maintain its ban on foreign workers until
2009, and possibly two years longer.
</P>
<P>
Labour Minister Olaf Scholz has "a certain sympathy for an
extension," owing to substantial unemployment levels, his
spokesman said Monday, but "with an exception for skilled
workers."
