Israelis Gather to Seek Prime Minister's Exit

TEL AVIV, Israel
</P>
<P>
Under a banner reading ``Failures, Go Home,'' tens of thousands
of Israelis from across the political spectrum joined Thursday
night in demanding the resignations of Prime Minister Ehud Olmert
and his defense minister for their performance during last
summer's war in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli leader remained defiant, telling aides that the size
and diversity of the crowd would not dissuade him from staying in
office.
</P>
<P>
Police said more than 100,000 demonstrators filled Rabin Square
in front of City Hall and spilled into surrounding streets. A
coalition of army reservists, students and relatives of war dead
that organized the protest estimated turnout at between 150,000
and 200,000. It was the largest rally against Olmert's government
in the 13 months it has been in office.
</P>
<P>
``Ehud Olmert, you said you work for us,'' Meir Shalev, a
renowned fiction writer, told the gathering. ``Olmert, you are
fired!''
</P>
<P>
The protest was called after an official inquiry panel concluded
Monday that Olmert and Defense Minister Amir Peretz had rushed
into war without a detailed plan or realistic goals. In 34 days
of fighting, the army failed to crush the Hezbollah militia, stop
it from firing rockets into Israel or free two captured soldiers.
</P>
<P>
While the panel did not call for resignations, its censure
triggered an outcry among Israelis, who view the war as a defeat.
By a margin of 2 to 1 in most polls this week, they said they
want Olmert and Peretz to resign.
</P>
<P>
Former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the rightist opposition
leader, joined Thursday in calling for their ouster.
</P>
<P>
Participants converged from all over Israel on a warm, muggy
evening. They included secular and religious Jews, hawks and
peaceniks, old and young, settlers in yarmulkes or long skirts,
and university students -- a mix reflecting the breadth of
disaffection with the country's leaders.
</P>
<P>
``It's wonderful to be here,'' said Debbie Stein, a 47-year-old
psychologist. ``It's the first time I can remember that people
from the whole political spectrum want one government out.'' She
joined the crowd in singing an anthem called ``We Deserve
Better'' that was written for the occasion.
</P>
<P>
Protesters held aloft signs reading ``Elections Now'' and ``Left
and Right Agree: Olmert Go Home.'' One group carried a mock
coffin labeled ``Government, RIP.'' Organizers called for a
moment of silence for the 158 Israelis killed during the war,
which also caused more than 1,000 deaths in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
``Look at this square, Mr. Prime Minister, it says it all,'' said
Ronny Zvigenbaum, speaking on behalf of army reservists. ``We are
ordinary citizens.''
</P>
<P>
The rally capped a week of political ferment that threatened to
topple Olmert from within his centrist Kadima party. In a
showdown Wednesday night, dissidents failed to muster a majority
of the party's parliamentary caucus against him.
</P>
<P>
It appeared that Olmert would survive the street protest as well.
One of his advisers, Tal Zilberstein, told Israel radio that
Thursday's rally served mainly to allow part of the population to
vent its frustration over the war.
</P>
<P>
``It doesn't mean that Olmert will now think he has to vacate his
position,'' the adviser said.
</P>
<P>
Peretz, the Labor Party leader, also has resisted calls to resign
but would lose his Cabinet job if he is defeated later this
month, as expected, in a party leadership primary.
</P>
<P>
Uzi Dayan, a retired general and chief organizer of Thursday's
gathering, said the protest movement would hold another rally in
about two weeks, after the release of closed-door panel testimony
by Olmert and Peretz.
</P>
<P>
Organizers excluded politicians from the speakers' roster to
maintain the movement's broad appeal. But parties on the left and
right mobilized supporters to attend.
</P>
<P>
Two members of parliament, Yossi Beilin of the leftist Meretz
Party and Effi Eitam of the right-wing National Religious Party-
National Unity, teamed to write a commentary in Thursday's
edition of the newspaper Ma'ariv. They rejected Olmert's argument
that he should stay in office to remedy the flaws in crisis
management highlighted by the war.
</P>
<P>
``One cannot accept the evil impulse that so many times whispers
in the ear of politicians in distress, that they and only they
can rescue their country from a severe crisis that they have
created,'' the lawmakers wrote.
</P>
<P>
Roey Tzovel, a 24-year-old mathematics student who hid in bomb
shelters last summer to avoid Hezbollah rockets falling near
Haifa, said he attended Thursday's rally to make a similar point:
``I realized that if I couldn't count on Olmert during the last
war, how can I count on him if another one breaks out?''

staff writer Boudreaux from Jerusalem.
