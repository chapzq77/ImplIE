There is one seat in first class that American Airlines is
opening to coach passengers -- the lavatory.
</P>
<P>
Beginning Thursday, coach passengers can use the front lavatory
on American once again after the airline restricted its use to
first-class fliers. The change applies to domestic flights and to
international flights leaving the U.S., said American spokesman
John Hotard.
</P>
<P>
Under a rule added following the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, only
first-class passengers could use that section's lavatory on
flights en route to the United States. American decided to apply
the rule to all flights, Hotard said.
</P>
<P>
The airline was the only carrier with such a rule on all flights,
so it opted to change the policy, Hotard said.
</P>
<P>
The change was announced in a memo to flight crews that was
obtained by the Fort Worth Star-Telegram.
</P>
<P>
Under Transportation Security Administration rules, passengers
flying into the United States still have to use lavatories in
their respective cabins.
</P>
<P>
A Boeing 757 has two lavatories in first class, which has 22
seats. Two are in coach, which has up to 160 passengers.
