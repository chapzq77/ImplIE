US, Britain, Canada threaten visa bans on Kenyan politicians as
pressure mounts on peace talks

The U.S. said Thursday it was threatening to bar 10 leading
Kenyan politicians and businessmen -- with ties to both the
president's party and his rival's -- from entering the United
States, as international pressure mounted on talks to resolve the
political crisis over disputed elections and to end violence.
</P>
<P>
President Mwai Kibaki's Party of National Unity and the
opposition Orange Democratic Movement denied being behind the
clashes, looting and arson that have caused more than 1,000
deaths and forced 300,000 Kenyans from their homes.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. announcement -- the first time Washington has blamed
leading politicians for the violence -- came as pressure mounted
on negotiators from the rival parties to come to terms in peace
talks mediated by former U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
</P>
<P>
Opposition leaders say Kibaki stole a Dec. 27 vote and should
step down. Kibaki has said his position as president is not
negotiable, though foreign and local observers say there was
election rigging. Clashes sparked by the dispute disintegrated
into ethnic fighting pitting other tribes against Kibaki's
Kikuyu.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Embassy spokesman T.J. Dowling said lawmakers from both
parties were advised they would not be allowed into the United
States because they had been involved in or incited violence.
</P>
<P>
"We don't give visas to criminals," Dowling told The Associated
Press. "Inciting violence is a criminal act."
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Michael Ranneberger told foreign journalists that
letters had been sent to the politicians and businessmen and
their families threatening a ban, which had not yet been imposed.
</P>
<P>
"What we have said is that people involved in inciting,
supporting or perpetrating violence must be held accountable and,
for our part, as the United States of America, we will hold them
accountable by not providing visas," Ranneberger said.
</P>
<P>
Britain said it could take similar steps.
</P>
<P>
"We have in the past excluded Kenyan politicians and businessmen
on the grounds of corruption. We have the ability to do so and
nothing has been ruled out," a British Foreign Office
spokesperson said on condition of anonymity, in keeping with the
ministry's regulations.
</P>
<P>
A Canadian official also said his country was applying similar
visa restrictions.
</P>
<P>
The Standard daily on Thursday quoted Canadian High Commissioner
Ross Hynes as saying that Canada wanted to pass "a strong message
to the politicians that the ban is real and will happen."
</P>
<P>
In a statement, Kibaki's government welcomed the U.S. and
Canadian decisions "to bar people who participated in ethnic
cleansing and crimes against humanity during the post election
period." But his party denied any involvement.
</P>
<P>
Albert Muiruri, from Kibaki's party, said, "I can't think of one
PNU member of Parliament or top official who was involved in or
incited violence."
</P>
<P>
The opposition also said their politicians were not involved. "We
categorically deny that any ODM leader was behind any kind of
violence anywhere in the country," party spokesman Ahmed Hashi
said.
</P>
<P>
Foreign observers have reported evidence of orchestrated violence
and accused both sides of fomenting clashes.
</P>
<P>
Visiting delegations urged the parties Thursday to reach
agreement in the talks that began Jan. 29.
</P>
<P>
EU Development Commissioner Louis Michel, who met with Kibaki and
his rival in the election, Raila Odinga, said the European Union
expects that "a consensus would be reached on all issues,
including addressing the underlying causes of the postelection
violence."
</P>
<P>
Michel urged the rivals to compromise.
</P>
<P>
"There are strong signals of flexibility and open-minded attitude
that gives me a little more optimistic perspective for the future
of Kenya," He told reporters. "All sides have to make efforts.
There is a price for agreement."
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, Annan warned that political issues in the
talks would be tough.
</P>
<P>
"The topic is a crucial one, proving divisive at times, but the
talks proceeded in a good spirit," his office said in a statement
about Thursday's talks. "They are moving more slowly than in
previous sessions but are moving steadily ahead."
</P>
<P>
Between meetings Thursday, foreign ministers from the East
African IGAD bloc met with the three-member panel of negotiators
"to express solidarity with the people of Kenya and the work of
the panel."
</P>
<P>
Opposition leader Odinga also signaled some optimism, telling
reporters that the negotiations provided "an opportunity to deal
with issues that had been under the carpet for too long, so that
we can find a sustainable solution for our country."
</P>
<P>
A U.N. fact-finding mission, sent by the U.N. High Commissioner
for Human Rights Louise Arbour, was in Kenya to assess
allegations of grave human rights violations during the fighting,
and a top U.N. relief agency official was to arrive Friday to
assess the humanitarian situation. John Holmes, from the
humanitarian affairs and emergency relief department would also
meet government and opposition leaders, the U.N. said.
</P>
<P>
Heads of state from five East African countries are also expected
in Nairobi to hold a special summit to support Annan's peace
process.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council has deplored the violence and urged
political leaders to resolve the crisis "through dialogue,
negotiation and compromise." It expressed concern at the "dire
humanitarian situation" in the country and gave strong backing to
the Annan-led talks that began Jan. 29, in a statement released
in New York.
</P>
<P>
Last month, the top U.S. diplomat for Africa said she saw the
violence as ethnic cleansing, but the State Department backed
away from her statement, saying the U.S. had not yet concluded
whether atrocities had been committed.
</P>
<P>
Fighting has continued in western Kenya, scene of some of the
worst postelection clashes. On Thursday, police said an officer
accused of killing two demonstrators last month in Kisumu,
western Kenya, will be charged with murder.
