A new hydropower plant started generating electricity in
southwest China's Tibet Autonomous Region on Friday.

The Xoka Hydropower Station, in Gongbo'gyamda County in east
Tibet's Nyingchi Prefecture, has four generating units each with
a capacity of 10,000 kw, said Wang Lidong, director of the
station's construction headquarters under the Tibet Power Co.
Ltd.

The station can generate 182 million kwh of electricity a year,
Wang said.

<P>
"It can help ease the power supply shortage in Nyingchi," he
said.

Construction began in June 2006 with an investment of 723 million
yuan (106 million U.S. dollars) and its reservoir holds 860,000
cubic meters of water with a dam of almost 20 meters in height.

Nyingchi has been facing power shortage for years, local
officials have said.

"The operation of the new power station will boost the
construction of power and transport facilities in Gongbo'gyamda
County," said Li Sang, head of the county.
</P>
<P>
"It will also help improve living conditions for residents," he
said.
