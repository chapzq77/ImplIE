CLINTON AND OBAMA FACE GOP ATTACKS FOR IRAQ VOTE SARAH WHEATON
AND ROBIN TONER CONTRIBUTED REPORTING.

<P>
The decision by two of the leading Democratic presidential
candidates to vote against a bill providing more money for the
war in Iraq because it did not set a timetable to withdraw the
troops reverberated on the campaign trail yesterday, underscoring
the deep divisions over the war between Democrats and
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
The two Democrats, Sens. Hillary Rodham Clinton and Barack Obama,
quickly found their votes attacked by Republicans.
</P>
<P>
Sen. John McCain and Mitt Romney, two Republican presidential
candidates who had been feuding all week, found common ground in
denouncing Clinton and Obama.
</P>
<P>
McCain, of Arizona, said he was disappointed to see them "embrace
the policy of surrender by voting against funds to support our
brave men and women fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan."
</P>
<P>
Romney, a former governor of Massachusetts, said that "voting
against our troops during a time of war shows the American people
that the leaders of the Democrat Party will abandon principle in
favor of political positioning."
</P>
<P>
Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former mayor of New York and a
Republican presidential hopeful, said later in the day that the
Democrats were "in denial of the war on terrorism."
</P>
<P>
Obama countered with a sharp statement of his own. "This country
is united in our support for our troops, but we also owe them a
plan to relieve them of the burden of policing someone else's
civil war," he said. "Governor Romney and Senator McCain clearly
believe the course we are on in Iraq is working, but I do not."
</P>
<P>
"And if there ever was a reflection of that," Obama continued,
"it's the fact that Senator McCain required a flack jacket, 10
armored Humvees, 2 Apache attack helicopters and 100 soldiers
with rifles by his side to stroll through a market in Baghdad
just a few weeks ago."
</P>
<P>
McCain did not leave that alone. "By the way, Senator Obama," he
said in a statement, "it's a 'flak' jacket, not a 'flack'
jacket."
</P>
<P>
Clinton, for her part, said, "I fully support our troops, and
wish the president had followed the will of the people and signed
the original bill we sent which both funded the troops and set a
new course of phased redeployment."
</P>
<P>
The divisions did not run strictly along party lines. While Sen.
Christopher J. Dodd, D-Conn., voted against the bill, another
Democratic presidential candidate, Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr. of
Delaware, voted for it. McCain voted for it. Sen. Sam Brownback,
R-Kan., another presidential candidate, did not vote.
</P>
<P>
In the House, two Republican presidential hopefuls, Reps. Duncan
Hunter of California and Tom Tancredo of Colorado, supported the
bill. Two other candidates, Reps. Dennis J. Kucinich, D-Ohio, and
Ron Paul, R-Texas, opposed it.
</P>
<P>
Obama was the first to cast his vote against the bill on
Thursday. Within minutes, Clinton strode into the chamber and
voted.
</P>
<P>
Clinton dismissed the idea that she would pay for this vote in a
general election, with Republican accusations that she had
abandoned troops. "Nobody believes that," she said. "That's just
propaganda."
</P>
<P>
Clinton also dismissed a reporter's suggestion that her votes had
closely tracked Obama's in recent months. "I think it's the other
way around, don't you?" she said.
