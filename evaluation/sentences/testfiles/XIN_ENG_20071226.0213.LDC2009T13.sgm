LOS ANGELES, Dec. 26 (Xinhua)
</P>
<P>
U.S. border authorities arrested just under 877,000 illegal
crossers in fiscal 2007, which ended in September, down 20
percent compared with the year before, The Los Angeles Times
reported Wednesday.

A drop in apprehensions is often interpreted as a sign that fewer
migrants are attempting the trip, the paper said.

The growth rate of the U.S. Mexican-born population has dropped
by nearly half to 4.2 percent in 2007 from about 8 percent in
2005 and 2006, the paper quoted an analysis of census data by the
Pew Hispanic Center.

<P>
Employment of foreign-born Hispanics increased at a markedly
slower pace in the first quarter of 2007 than during the same
period in the previous three years, according to the report.

<P>
Growth in employment of foreign-born Hispanics in that sector was
10.9 percent early this year, compared with an average first-
quarter growth rate of 19.8 percent from 2004 to 2006, said the
report.

The growth in remittances sent to Mexico has dwindled to a
trickle. Through October of this year, Mexicans living abroad
sent 20.4 billion U.S. dollars home to their families, a 1.3
percent increase over the same period in 2006, according to
Mexico's central bank. Those sums were growing in excess of 20
percent annually just a few years ago.

<P>
Authorities attributed the apparent decline to the slump in U.S.
construction and the result of stepped-up enforcement. U.S.
construction has been a magnet for undocumented workers over the
last few years -- one in five Latino immigrants works in the
building trades.

<P>
About 15,000 U.S. Border Patrol agents have been deployed to the
region, 25 percent more than in 2006. Three thousand more are
slated to be in place by the end of 2008.
