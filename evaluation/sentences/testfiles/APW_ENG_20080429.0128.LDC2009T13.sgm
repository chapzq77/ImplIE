Vietnam to halt American adoptions after damning US report
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

HO CHI MINH CITY, Vietnam 2008-04-29 02:23:19 UTC
</P>
<P>
Vietnam, where growing numbers of Americans have turned to adopt
a baby, announced it would stop processing new adoption
applications from U.S. citizens in July following allegations of
baby-selling, corruption and fraud.
</P>
<P>
The abrupt cutoff cast some uncertainty over pending adoptions in
the Southeast Asian country, which have surged in the face of
tightened restrictions in China, Guatemala and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
The announcement came days after The Associated Press published
details of a U.S. Embassy report that outlined rampant abuses,
including hospitals selling infants whose mothers could not pay
their bills, brokers scouring villages for babies and a
grandmother who gave away her grandchild without telling the
child's mother.
</P>
<P>
"It is tragic for children that the U.S. government has not been
able to find ways to work with the Vietnamese government to
prevent adoption abuses while at the same time processing
legitimate adoptions," said Tom Atwood, president of the
Washington-based National Council for Adoption, a research and
advocacy organization.
</P>
<P>
"Many hundreds, perhaps thousands, of children will not have
families as a result of this failure of leadership."
</P>
<P>
U.S. adoptions have boomed in Vietnam, with Americans --
including actress Angelina Jolie -- adopting more than 1,200
Vietnamese children over the 18 months ending in March. In 2007,
adoptions quadrupled from a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
In its nine-page report, the U.S. Embassy said some American
adoption agencies paid orphanage officials as much as $10,000 per
referral, while others took them on shopping sprees and junkets
to the United States in return for a flow of babies.
</P>
<P>
It said questions arose after routine investigations turned up
widespread inconsistencies in adoption paperwork. There was also
a suspicious surge in the number of babies listed as abandoned,
making it impossible to confirm the children were genuine orphans
or that their parents had knowingly put them up for adoption, as
required by U.S. law.
</P>
<P>
Vu Duc Long, director of Vietnam's International Adoption Agency,
called the U.S. allegations "groundless." On Monday, he said
Vietnam was scrapping a bilateral agreement with the United
States that sought to regulate the adoption system.
</P>
<P>
"They (the Americans) can say whatever they want, but we are not
going to renew it," Long said.
</P>
<P>
"I am so disappointed with the U.S. side," Long said. "They have
been uncooperative and have no respect for us. It is a pity that
we have had to end the agreement. There are many orphaned babies
here, but if they are not going to have American families, they
will find their families in other countries."
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the U.S. Embassy in Hanoi, Vietnam said it would
stop taking adoption applications from American families after
July 1. Adoption arrangements with other countries are
unaffected.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. State Department said the Vietnam government would allow
adoption to be completed in pending cases where prospective
parents had been matched with a child and received an official
referral before Sept. 1.
</P>
<P>
After that date, it said any dossier that had not received a
referral will be closed and returned to the adoption agency. It
said given the time it takes to process a claim, any adoption
initiated now would be unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Embassy said it respected Hanoi's decision, but was
confident of the accuracy of its report about the situation in
Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
"The government of Vietnam has made their own decision, but we
believe that our report speaks for itself," said spokeswoman
Angela Aggeler.
</P>
<P>
It was not immediately clear how many U.S. couples were affected
by the decision.
</P>
<P>
Linda Brownlee, executive director of a Washington-based
international adoption agency, said the decision would mean that
20 families on its waiting list will not be able to be matched
with children in time.
</P>
<P>
"Now their dossiers will be returned to them," said Brownlee of
The Adoption Center, one of more than 40 U.S. agencies that
arrange adoptions of Vietnamese children.
</P>
<P>
She said the embassy report did not cover positive aspects of
adoptions in the country.
</P>
<P>
"They didn't say how many visas they had approved with no
problem," she said. "I know many agencies who have done great
work there and that doesn't get reported."
</P>
<P>
Keith Wallace, CEO of Families Thru International Adoption,
agreed. "The (abuse) cases reported by the embassy ... are such a
very small fraction" of U.S. adoptions in Vietnam, he said. "It
is wrong to imply that Vietnamese adoptions are corrupt through
and through."
</P>
<P>
Vietnam suspended all adoptions with foreign countries in 2003
over concerns about corruption. U.S. adoptions resumed in 2005
under a bilateral agreement intended to ensure they were above
board. It was due for renewal on Sept. 1.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam is only the latest country where U.S. adoptions have been
halted or severely restricted.
</P>
<P>
Suspected fraud and other irregularities have cast a cloud over
the nearly 3,000 pending U.S. adoptions from Guatemala, the
second-largest source of U.S. adopted children after China. Under
State Department pressure, Guatemala is allowing those to go
through, but would-be parents were warned last year not to
initiate new adoptions.
</P>
<P>
By contrast, adoptions from Ethiopia are on the increase, growing
71 percent to 1,255 last year.
