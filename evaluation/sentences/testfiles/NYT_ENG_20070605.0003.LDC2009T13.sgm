A BLUEPRINT FOR A COMEBACK, BUT NOT THE TOOLS
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Until the Red Sox won the World Series in 2004, they had long
tortured their frenzied fans by practicing what I called the
Ultimate Tease. They would lure their fans into thinking they
were going to win the World Series so they could obliterate
"1918" from their vocabulary, then fall short at the last moment,
sometimes in the regular season, like in 1978, sometimes in the
postseason, like in 2003 and 1986.
</P>
<P>
Now that 2004 is behind them, the Red Sox are in perfect position
to stage Ultimate Tease II.
</P>
<P>
I know a Boston-area resident who is rooting for Ultimate Tease
II. A Red Sox fan but nevertheless a rational person, my friend
the fan explained the reason during last weekend in Boston.
</P>
<P>
In April, Sharon related, a furniture store in her Boston suburb
-- I won't identify the town because if the Red Sox don't win
this year, frenzied fans could blame her and burn down her house
-- had a Red Sox-related sales gimmick. Buy furniture now, and if
the Red Sox win the World Series this year, it will be free.
</P>
<P>
Her reason for rooting against the Red Sox is simple. She was
unable to buy the furniture at the time, and if the Red Sox win
and it turns out that she could have had the furniture for
nothing, she would be very upset with herself.
</P>
<P>
The Red Sox are acting as if they plan at least to win the
American League East, finishing ahead of the Yankees for the
first time in a dozen years. That is, they acted that way until
Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
Nearly four months -- more than 100 games -- remain in the
season, but had the Red Sox held on to their 5-4 lead, they might
have driven a stake into the heart of the Evil Empire. But Hideki
Okajima couldn't hold the lead, and Jonathan Papelbon couldn't
maintain the tie, and the Yankees scored a victory that could
have far greater ramifications than a game in the standings in
June.
</P>
<P>
"It can go a long way," said Ron Guidry, the Yankees' pitching
coach, who speaks from experience, an experience Boston fans
thought they had finally ripped from their psyches.
</P>
<P>
Guidry pitched -- brilliantly -- for the 1978 Yankees, who
overcame a 14-game deficit, caught the Red Sox in September, beat
them in a one-game playoff in October and went on to win the
World Series for the second successive season.
</P>
<P>
Had these Red Sox won Sunday, they would have led the Yankees by
14 1/2 games. That's an interesting number, because some people
believe the Red Sox' lead over the Yankees in July 1978 was 14
1/2 games when it was only 14.
</P>
<P>
Maybe the outcome of Sunday night's game will be immaterial --
the Yankees failed to build on their momentum by losing in
Chicago on Monday night -- but a Red Sox victory could have
delivered a mortal blow.
</P>
<P>
Joe Torre talked the other day about a renewed fight and spirit
he saw in his team, though his view sounded like something he
said he saw a couple of weeks ago. That fight and spirit may have
evaporated with a loss, and a bad season would have turned into a
long, bad season.
</P>
<P>
Losing two games with Mike Mussina and Andy Pettitte pitching
would have been especially discouraging.
</P>
<P>
The Sunday night victory, however, could serve as a catalyst for
a comeback. With 17 weeks left, the Yankees have to gain less
than a game a week to catch the Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
"Winning this way, hopefully it's a sign of things to come for
us," general manager Brian Cashman said. "We're living a Stephen
King-type novel, but we have a chance to change the end of the
story here. It's going to take a long time and a lot of hard
work. We're not giving up. This was a great win for us."
</P>
<P>
In 1978, the Yankees were 14 games behind the Red Sox for three
days in July. On the third day, the Yankees began a five-game
winning streak. On the day they won their fifth straight, the Red
Sox lost their fourth in a row, and that quickly, a 14-game lead
had become 10.
</P>
<P>
On that day, July 23, Reggie Jackson returned from a four-game
suspension and Billy Martin said of him and George Steinbrenner,
"The two of them deserve each other; one's a born liar, the
other's convicted."
</P>
<P>
The next day, Martin tearfully resigned and was replaced by Bob
Lemon. Calm descended on the Yankees' clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
In the next eight weeks, the Yankees went 38-14, while the Red
Sox went 24-28. That 14-game deficit was now a three-and-a-half-
game lead.
</P>
<P>
Guidry said he wasn't sure what effect Lemon's presence had on
the comeback. "I can't say that that was the deciding factor, but
it was one factor," he said. "It brought some calmness to the
clubhouse."
</P>
<P>
The 2007 clubhouse is already calm. Torre is similar to Lemon in
that respect. But these Yankees don't have the pitching those
Yankees had.
</P>
<P>
"You need to have the pitchers doing their job," Guidry said.
"Right now, that's where we're weak."
</P>
<P>
If the Yankees don't stage a comeback, they will fail because
their pitching isn't good enough to sustain the necessary winning
streaks. The Red Sox's pitching, meanwhile, may be too strong to
allow losing streaks.
</P>
<P>
But Guidry said after the Sunday night surprise: "This team still
has character. A game like tonight shows that."
