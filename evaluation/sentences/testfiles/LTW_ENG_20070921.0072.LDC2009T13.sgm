HIMOWITZ ON COMPUTERS: About as Good as Digital Photo Prints Get
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's no secret that many printers are sold as loss leaders. A
manufacturer can give away great hardware if he can sell the ink
at $35 a cartridge and paper for 25 cents a snapshot. That's
where the profit is.
</P>
<P>
Given that business model, I've always been suspicious of
printers equipped to print photos directly from a camera's memory
card without going through a computer.
</P>
<P>
For me, editing photos is the whole point of digital photography.
A perfect shot is rare. With a computer you get a chance to
adjust the exposure, crop the image, lighten the shadows,
eliminate red-eye and smooth out the occasional wrinkle. All
this happens before you commit to paper. So printing straight
from a memory card always  has  seemed to be an invitation to
waste money on bad shots.
</P>
<P>
But I've changed my mind after spending a week with the new Epson
PictureMate Dash. The latest in Epson's line of small-format
printers turns out spectacular 4- by   6-inch photos in 45
seconds -- with or without a computer.
</P>
<P>
A caveat: This compact machine is strictly for snapshot-sized
prints. But at $99.99, it's small and inexpensive enough to keep
next to your regular printer, especially if you're the family
photographer and expect to churn out a lot of prints.
</P>
<P>
At 26 cents for paper and ink combined, PictureMate shots are
slightly more expensive than online photofinishers, but
relatively cheap for at-home printing. For many photographers,
instant gratification is well worth the extra pennies.
</P>
<P>
With a 6- by 8-inch footprint, the PictureMate Dash doesn't
claim much desktop real estate. And s etup was a snap:   I
inserted a print cartridge, flipped up the lid, pulled up the
hinged LCD display window and loaded 4 x 6 photo paper from the
top.
</P>
<P>
A handful of buttons on the top control the printer with the aid
of on-screen menus;  front-panel slots accommodate all popular
memory cards. There are two USB ports, one for a PC and another
for cameras that support direct printing. A wireless Bluetooth
adapter is available for the cable-challenged, and a $50 battery
pack will print 140 photos between charges if you're on the road.
</P>
<P>
Brushing skepticism aside, I began work without hooking the
PictureMate to a PC. I popped a Secure Digital  memory card
loaded with vacation pictures into the slot, and a few seconds
later I was viewing the images on the surprisingly bright,
3.6-inch LCD screen. The buttons and menus made navigation easy
-- I could view one shot at time or peruse a lineup of thumbnail
images (actually, in that small window, they're really
"pinkynail" images, but still viewable).
</P>
<P>
One irritant of digital photography is that cameras record images
with a 4-to-3 aspect ratio -- the same proportion as standard TV
screens and PC monitors. Unfortunately, most commercial photo
paper and picture frames are designed to accommodate 4- by
6-inch prints, with their elongated aspect ratio. That means you
have to crop most images slightly to make them fit properly.
</P>
<P>
The PictureMate made this cropping chore surprisingly easy from
the control panel. Same for adjusting basic exposure and color
settings.
</P>
<P>
What amazed me was   how little adjustment most decent exposures
needed. With automatic enhancement turned on, the PictureMate
churned out one gorgeous, well-balanced glossy photo after
another. Each one took about 45 seconds, which is more than twice
as fast as my general-purpose printer, an aging but reliable HP
Photosmart 1100.
</P>
<P>
Also, to my surprise, the PictureMate accurately removed red-eye
from several flash pictures and did its best to adjust for some
badly exposed shots -- although it couldn't perform miracles.
</P>
<P>
Among other bells and whistles, the PictureMate prints in black-
and-white or sepia, and it  offers multiple photo layouts. They
include thumbnail images of all the photos on a card, dual
wallet-size or four mini-wallet-size prints, double passport-size
photos, 3- or 4-inch square images, and other entertaining if
less-than-useful options.
</P>
<P>
When I finally got around to hooking up the PictureMate to my PC,
the drivers installed without a problem under Windows XP. For
real editing, Epson bundles a version of ArcSoft PhotoImpression,
a quirky but reasonably competent entry-level program. It
produced excellent prints, as did Adobe PhotoShop Elements and
Microsoft's Digital Imaging, the two photo-editing programs I
normally use.
</P>
<P>
For prints with a long life, I usually recommend photofinishing
services, which use real photographic paper and chemistry,
instead of ink. But Epson now claims its inks will last 96 years
under glass and 200 years in a closed album -- a lot longer than
I'll ever last.
</P>
<P>
Can you believe those claims? Who knows, since tests can only
simulate the effects of time. But there's no doubt that today's
inks are more permanent than early formulas, which were prone to
smudging and fading.
</P>
<P>
Unlike most competitors, Epson bundles its ink cartridge and
paper in PrintPaks, which cost $40 for 150 glossy photos (26
cents a shot) or $35 for 100 matte prints (35 cents each). That
makes Epson consumable supplies hard to compare directly with
Hewlett-Packard, Canon and other vendors who sell ink and paper
separately. But my take is that the per-print price is on the low
end, considering the quality.
</P>
<P>
For those with bigger budgets and more ambition, Epson makes a
$200 version of this printer called the PictureMate Zoom with a
built-in CD burner. This accessory allows users to make photo CDs
for friends and family,   but it sounds pretty expensive for
marginal additional utility.
</P>
<P>
Bottom line: Given its reasonable upfront cost, superb images and
economy of operation, it's hard to find much fault with the basic
PictureMate Dash.
</P>
<P>
If you're getting started with digital photography and don't want
to use a computer as middleman, the PictureMate Dash does a great
job with images straight out of the camera. If you're an
experienced digital photographer and want a gadget that can spit
out a stream of high-quality snapshots in short order, it's a
nifty gadget.
