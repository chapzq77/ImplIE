Africa ' s longest wars

<P>
Uganda's government and a rebel group responsible for one of
Africa's longest and most brutal wars signed a new truce Saturday
and agreed to resume stalled peace talks later this month.
</P>
<P>
The elusive leader of the rebel Lord's Resistance Army, Joseph
Kony, witnessed the signing in Ri-Kwangba, Sudan, LRA spokesman
Martin Ojul told The Associated Press. Kony has appeared in
public only a handful of times, fearing arrest and extradition to
the Hague to answer war crimes charges.
</P>
<P>
During the LRA's two-decade insurgency, the group has been blamed
for murder, mutilations and kidnapping children for use as
soldiers and sex slaves. Two million people have been displaced
by the conflict, aid organizations say.
</P>
<P>
Both sides signed a truce in August and began peace talks, but
the deal has been undermined with the two trading accusations of
hostility. Under the new truce, rebel fighters have until the end
of June to gather in Ri-Kwangba, where they will be protected and
monitored while a broader peace deal is negotiated.
</P>
<P>
Renewed talks will begin April 26.
</P>
<P>
"We are enjoying ourselves, the atmosphere is good and we are
happy to be resuming the talks," Ojul said.
</P>
<P>
Ojul and the government's top negotiator, Internal Affairs
Minister Ruhakana Rugunda, signed the truce. Kony was wearing
civilian clothes, not a military uniform, as a "gesture of
goodwill," Ojul said.
</P>
<P>
The Lord's Resistance Army is made up of the remnants of a
rebellion that began after Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni took
power in 1986. It has set up rear bases in Sudan and Congo, and
has been accused of attacking civilians and threatening stability
in those countries.
</P>
<P>
The conflict has spilled over into southern Sudan and Congo,
causing further instability in the region. If both sides reach a
comprehensive deal, it will be a breakthrough in pacifying
northern Uganda, eastern Congo and southern Sudan.
