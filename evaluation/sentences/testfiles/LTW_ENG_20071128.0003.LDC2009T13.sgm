Oaxaca After the Riots
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The last time I was in Oaxaca, I was frantically trying to
improvise a gas mask. The city was a war zone: anti-government
protesters packing spray paint, rocks and Molotov cocktails;
police in riot gear tossing canisters of black tear gas into the
crowd.
</P>
<P>
My eyes stinging, I raced past the burned-out shell of a bus.
Thick smoke filled the air, but there was just enough of a
clearing to allow me a glimpse of El Catedral restaurant. It
looked so enticing: a serene courtyard, white tablecloths and
glass wine goblets with the distinctive Mexican blue rim. But the
door was locked.
</P>
<P>
I kept running.
</P>
<P>
Fast-forward one year and I'm finally inside El Catedral, and in
a city that feels much different.
</P>
<P>
Seated under the stars on an ancient stone patio, a fountain
burbling beside me, I savor sauteed mushrooms in garlic wine
sauce. The setting is almost exactly as I envisioned it would be:
a place of architectural jewels, one-of-a-kind textiles and
culinary surprises.
</P>
<P>
Except I am alone.
</P>
<P>
The two-story bar, all polished wood and chrome, is dark. The
dining room to the right of the courtyard is as empty as the one
to the left.
</P>
<P>
I have returned to Oaxaca on assignment: Find out if, one year
after deadly riots crippled the city, it is again an attractive
destination for visitors seeking language schools, colonial
history, craft markets and art galleries.
</P>
<P>
I'm eager -- and a bit apprehensive -- to check in on friends I'd
made here and find out whether Oaxaca still belongs on Mexico's
A-list. It didn't take long to realize that the answer is more
complicated than I'd thought.
</P>
<P>
Oaxaca (wa-HA-ka) is no longer the filthy, smoldering wreck of
2006. Nor, however, is it the bustling cultural center of years
past. It appears safe and clean. But unresolved political
tensions have prompted the U.S. State Department to keep it on a
watch list. "We're not discouraging tourism," says U.S. Embassy
spokeswoman Judith Bryan. "But we want informed and appropriately
cautious tourism."
</P>
<P>
My friend Harry Smith, a Bostonian living in Oaxaca with his wife
and three daughters, is keenly aware of the economic and
political injustices in the city. But he also wants Americans to
appreciate its warmth and beauty.
</P>
<P>
"I would advise people to come, as long as they come with their
eyes open," he says. "But this is not Disneyland."
</P>
<P>
As in most of Oaxaca, things at El Catedral, where I've come for
dinner, are "mas o menos," explains my waiter, Alberto.
Translated literally, the phrase means "more or less." But
Alberto's diplomatic shorthand, which I will hear often during a
three-day visit, hints at the conflicted, contradictory state of
an emotionally scarred city.
</P>
<P>
For adventurous travelers, "mas o menos" can also translate to
opportunity. The decline in foreign visitors -- from 264,000 in
2005 to 190,000 this year through October -- means there are
bargains to be had and no hordes to fight. Smith, for instance,
negotiated half-price rates at the nearby beaches of Puerto
Escondido.
</P>
<P>
As I finish an affordable glass of Spanish tempranillo, two
groups arrive at El Catedral, adding a bit of life to the
courtyard.
</P>
<P>
"It's certainly not like it was three years ago," declares
Virginia O'Brien, a San Diegan who has returned to the city every
year since her first Spanish language class in 1984. "This place
would be packed; we'd be lucky to get a table."
</P>
<P>
Now in her 70s, with cropped red hair and kitschy-cool Mexican-
silver skeletons dangling from her ears, O'Brien loves Oaxaca so
much she even came during the riots. She and a travel agent
friend "were going to bring a tour last year, but we canceled it,
thank God," she says. This year's group backed out.
</P>
<P>
"People are taking their kids back to school; they're walking in
the Zocalo (town square) again," says her dining companion,
Javier Garcia Vigil, who is the director of the Symphony of
Oaxaca.
</P>
<P>
O'Brien, who loves to scout for bargain-price hand-woven rugs,
remains bullish on Oaxaca. But she is sad: "It hasn't staged a
real comeback yet."
</P>
<P>
The New Normal
</P>
<P>
Oaxaca -- it's the name of both the capital city and the state --
is an hour's flight south of Mexico City. The city (population
before the riots: 258,000) was laid out by Spaniards in the mid-
1500s, and its streets are lined by mossy relics of that era. The
surrounding region boasts phenomenal ruins, such as the sprawling
hilltop Zapotec village of Monte Alban, and what is believed to
be one of the largest and best-preserved indigenous cultures in
the Mesoamerican world.
</P>
<P>
Protest is as much a part of Oaxaca's tradition as its black clay
pottery and hand-woven tapestries. So when the city's teachers
announced their perennial strike in May 2006, it barely caused a
stir. But unlike in previous years, the dispute escalated into a
broader conflict over social justice.
</P>
<P>
Anti-government demonstrators stormed local radio stations and
occupied Oaxaca's famed Zocalo. The city once known for
picturesque cathedrals, graceful laurel trees and colorful
marketplaces was coated in graffiti and strewn with the charred
remains of vehicles.
</P>
<P>
Some 4,000 federal police descended, erecting barricades and
military-style encampments. Masked protesters countered with
guerrilla tactics, hurling burning tires and rocks collected from
the cobblestone streets. Before order was restored in December,
the riots claimed the lives of at least nine and as many as 20
people, including American activist/journalist Brad Will.
</P>
<P>
Today, mariachi music fills the Zocalo and fresh whitewash covers
the walls. But marches in opposition to state Gov. Ulises Ruiz --
who sent riot police to battle demonstrators -- occur often, and
residents say the underlying economic and political tensions
remain.
</P>
<P>
Officially, Oaxaca is back to normal. And as if to prove it, the
government has taken a more active role in some of the city's
most beloved festivals, which once had been ad-hoc community
affairs.
</P>
<P>
But a more nuanced truth comes out when you share a coffee or a
shot of mezcal with Oaxacans or with those, like my friend John
Rexer, who have adopted the city.
</P>
<P>
"It feels antiseptic," he remarks as we walk through the Zocalo
and the adjacent square known as the Alameda. Rexer, an expat
American, runs the Cafe No Se bar in Antigua, Guatemala. But he
spends much of his time in Oaxaca overseeing his latest business
venture, a new brand of mezcal named Ilegal. "It feels as though
it's been prettied up and staged for the tourists."
</P>
<P>
Yes, it's nice not to be dodging flying rocks, he acknowledges.
But in its effort to remove the ugly barricades and trash, the
government also swept away a bit of Oaxaca's soul.
</P>
<P>
Problems and Opportunities
</P>
<P>
We walk the few blocks to El Naranjo restaurant, where a decade
ago, Oaxaca native Iliana de la Vega won international acclaim --
and sneers from local culinary purists -- with her lard-free mole
and organic ingredients. An English-speaking man in chef's whites
directs us to a table next to an ancient orange tree. He is
friendly, helpful and definitely not de la Vega.
</P>
<P>
She fled Oaxaca last year, and after drifting from New Mexico to
Austin, Texas, hopes to soon join the staff of the Culinary
Institute of America in San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
"We just couldn't make it," she tells me later in a telephone
interview. "We had trouble getting downtown; we couldn't get
deliveries; we couldn't pay the rent. We'd cook all that food and
then no customers would come."
</P>
<P>
Andrew Peterson, the new owner, proudly announces that he has
changed every recipe on the menu save one: de la Vega's gazpacho.
In the interest of science, I order that and the mole, which had
been El Naranjo's specialty. Neither dish stands out, and Rexer
grumbles that he has trouble detecting any chilies in his
allegedly spicy shrimp.
</P>
<P>
Though pleasant, El Naranjo falls short: sadly gringoized, when
what we crave is authenticity.
</P>
<P>
We amble out for a late-night stroll, pleasantly surprised to
find others on the streets, a far cry from the days of curfews.
As we turn the corner onto Macedonio Alcala, we can't resist the
lure of Caribbean music pulling us into Cafe del Borgo.
</P>
<P>
Behind the bar, owner Eduardo Evans looks relieved at the sight
of a relatively packed house.
</P>
<P>
"The last four months were the worst," says Evans, better known
by his nickname, Lalo. With occupancy at many hotels below 10
percent, he considered leaving but couldn't: "All my money is
invested here."
</P>
<P>
Evans predicts that the holiday season -- with Oaxaca's parades,
religious ceremonies and famous radish carvings -- will be
better.
</P>
<P>
There is one difference nowadays that is both attractive to those
who complained Oaxaca had been inundated with gringos and
unfortunate for the business owners who survived on U.S. dollars.
The majority of visitors -- including the two men seated beside
me -- are Mexicans.
</P>
<P>
Artists in Crisis
</P>
<P>
Before the riots, Oaxaca had a thriving art scene, from museums
with artifacts of pre-Hispanic cultures to galleries with the
colorful paintings of 20th-century native Rufino Tamayo. As its
reputation grew, the area attracted not only painters but also
sculptors, writers, musicians and filmmakers, says local artist
Rowena Galavitz.
</P>
<P>
But last year, several galleries folded, and art students stopped
coming to the city for lectures, which meant the artists, too,
began abandoning Oaxaca. "Anybody who was able to get out, did,"
she says. Others, including Galavitz, began exhibiting in other
cities. Now, "I don't really have a market here in Oaxaca
anymore."
</P>
<P>
Though she is aware that the political disputes could flare up
again, Galavitz says the recent calm is helping to slowly revive
the art world. As we talk, a team of artists is hanging photos
and paintings for an exhibit of pieces about the protests opening
that night.
</P>
<P>
It will be called "Fallen Angels."
