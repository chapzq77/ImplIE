Putin says Belgium could serve as hub for Russian gas supplies to
Europe

<P>
President Vladimir Putin said Friday that a storage facility for
Russian natural gas could be built in Belgium to make it a hub
for gas exports to Europe.
</P>
<P>
Putin told visiting Belgian Prime Minister Guy Verhofstadt that
Belgium's gas pipeline network linking it to other EU nations
would make it a good location for a prospective natural gas
storage facility.
</P>
<P>
"We may implement a big project that would benefit not only our
nations, but all of Europe: building a big gas storage facility
that would allow for the shipment of gas to other nations,
including Britain, using European underwater pipelines
originating in Belgium,"
</P>
<P>
He did not elaborate on details of the project in his opening
remarks, which were carried by Russian state television.
</P>
<P>
Verhofstadt, who said he visited the offices of state-controlled
gas monopoly OAO Gazprom in the morning, said Belgium was ready
to strengthen relations with Russian companies, Russian news
agencies reported.
</P>
<P>
He said Belgium could serve as a natural hub for gas transport
and distribution, and that there were many prospects for
cooperation, but did not comment specifically on the storage
facility issue, according to the reports.
</P>
<P>
Russia now supplies nearly half of Europe's gas needs, raising
concern about its increasing clout, and has annoyed the European
Union by refusing to ratify an energy charter that would broaden
foreign access to its oil and gas deposits and export pipelines.
</P>
<P>
But Putin has said Moscow would not ratify the charter in its
current form, saying that the EU nations pushing for access to
Russia's energy deposits and long-distance gas pipelines must
offer assets comparable in value.
</P>
<P>
Gazprom has pushed for access to European retail markets,
sparking concern among some Europeans about its growing clout.
Gazprom last year signed asset-swap deals with Germany's BASF and
Italy's Eni SpA -- deals that Putin hailed as models for other EU
nations.
