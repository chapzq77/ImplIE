Hou Yu-ih, chief of the national police, told a hastily called

political spectrum and TV commentators.

Notable among the people threatened were former Premier Frank
Hsieh, first daughter Chen Hsin-yu, the chief of the Public

A total of 13 lawmakers from various political parties have
received threatening letters from Yang, and maverick lawmaker Lee
