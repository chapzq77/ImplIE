BP COMPROMISES ON RUSSIAN OIL VENTURE
</HEADLINE>

<P>
BP, the British energy company, agreed Thursday to replace the
head of its Russian joint venture and surrender some control on
the board to resolve a dispute with its billionaire Russian
partners and hold on to its most important source of new oil
reserves.
</P>
<P>
Under the deal, the chief executive of the joint venture, Robert
Dudley, an American, will step down by the end of the year, to be
succeeded by "a Russian-speaking candidate with extensive Russian
business experience" who will be nominated by BP. The new chief
executive will be charged with improving "transparency, financial
returns and the market value of the company's share."
</P>
<P>
The deal, which is to be finalized over the next few months,
calls for a reorganization of the TNK-BP board through the
appointment of three new independent directors. That could help
to end a deadlock in which the partners, each of which has five
directors, were unable to agree on strategy.
</P>
<P>
The companies also said they had agreed to an option for TNK-BP
to sell up to 20 percent of its shares through an initial public
offering, "subject to the consent of the Russian authorities."
</P>
<P>
BP had been locked in a struggle with its four Russian partners,
all billionaires, over control of the venture, in which BP and
the billionaires' consortium each holds 50 percent. The Russian
investors' side of the venture is called AAR, and consists of
Viktor Vekselberg, Mikhail Fridman, German Khan and Leonid
Blavatnik.
</P>
<P>
Fridman, chairman of the TNK-BP Ltd. board, said in a statement
released by AAR that the deal marked "an exciting new chapter in
the development of a great company," adding: "As long-term
investors, we are ambitious to see our joint venture with BP
achieve great success."
</P>
<P>
The BP chairman, Peter Sutherland, said in a separate statement
that the deal would ease management conflicts by aligning
shareholders' interests.
</P>
<P>
"It will create a stable base from which to grow the joint
venture to the benefit of everyone involved," Sutherland said,
"including the Russian state for which strong capital investment
and continued technical innovation to boost declining oil output
are so important."
</P>
<P>
Dudley, whose tenure at the top of the company had become
increasingly tenuous, was denied a Russian work visa in July. He
has continued to operate as chief executive from abroad.
</P>
<P>
Robert Wine, a BP spokesman in London, said the deal in no way
reflected badly on Dudley. "He's an exceptional CEO who's
delivered everything that was expected of him and more," Wine
said.
</P>
<P>
Uncertainty over the venture has weighed on BP's stock for
months, as it has accounted for nearly all of the growth in BP's
oil reserves in recent years. On Thursday, BP shares rose 4.3
percent in early London trading.
</P>
<P>
"We are pleased that this situation has been resolved and the
shareholders have come to an agreement without the involvement of
third parties, including the state," Igor Sechin, deputy prime
minister of the Russian Federation, said in the AAR statement.
"This is a positive signal for the Russian market. We support the
development of TNK-BP and believe that this company has excellent
long-term prospects."
