Cadbury Schweppes full-year net profit up 53 percent on favorable
comparison

LONDON 2007-02-20 17:09:10 UTC

<P>
Cadbury Schweppes PLC reported a 53 percent increase in annual
net profit Tuesday, but also unveiled weaker margins and
multimillion pound cost hits from a salmonella scare and
accounting fraud at its Nigerian business.
</P>
<P>
The rise in profits to 1.17 billion pounds (US$2.3 billion;
euro1.8 billion) in 2006 disappointed the market because it
benefited from a 600 million-pound (US$1.17 billion; euro890
million) gain from the US$2.2 billion (euro1.7 billion) sale of
the company's European soft drink unit.
</P>
<P>
Further underpinning earnings was 30 million pounds (US$58.5
million; euro44.55 million) from a British fire insurance claim
and another 30 million pounds in tax credits from a change in
British legislation.
</P>
<P>
Revenue for the maker of Dairy Milk chocolate and Dr Pepper soft
drinks rose 16 percent to 7.4 billion pounds (US$14.4 billion;
euro10.9 billion), from 6.4 billion pounds. The company does not
report quarterly results.
</P>
<P>
Chief Executive Todd Stitzer said the company made significant
progress in three of its four regions in 2007, but problems in
Britain and Nigeria held back the performance of the Europe,
Middle East and Africa region.
</P>
<P>
The company's British retail operations were hit last summer when
it was forced to recall a number of its chocolate products after
salmonella traces were discovered in them.
</P>
<P>
The company said the recall had reduced revenues by between 30
million pounds and 35 million pounds (US$58.5 million and US$68.2
million; euro44.6 million and euro51.9 million), with profit down
between 5 million pounds and 10 million pounds (US$9.7 million
and US$19.5 million; euro7.4 million and euro14.9 million).
</P>
<P>
The company also revealed it took a 15 million pound (US$29.3
million; euro22.3 million) charge because of overstatements in
income from its Nigerian operation. The accounting fraud was
discovered in November, more than six months after Cadbury
increased its stake in the operation from 46 percent to just over
50 percent.
</P>
<P>
Cadbury shares fell 2 percent to close at 564 pence (US$11.03;
euro8.39) on the London Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
Product problems continued into this year, with Cadbury earlier
this months recalling a number of its Easter egg lines because
they failed to carry the correct nut allergy labeling.
</P>
<P>
But Stitzer said the company was optimistic about its prospects
in 2007 and its "strong innovation pipeline" including the launch
of gum brand Trident into Britain.
</P>
<P>
Citigroup analyst Warren Ackerman said the US$4.2 billion
takeover of U.S. group Adams in 2002 was paying off, giving
Cadbury a powerful position in chewing gum with the Trident and
Dentyne brands and in the medicated sweets market with Halls
products.
</P>
<P>
"The Adams acquisition has transformed the portfolio," Ackerman
said. "We remain convinced that the end game is to spin off U.S.
beverages to create a pure play in confectionery."
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that Cadbury itself was likely to be the target of
takeover rumors throughout the year, following reported interest
from companies including Kraft Foods Inc. and Hershey Co.
