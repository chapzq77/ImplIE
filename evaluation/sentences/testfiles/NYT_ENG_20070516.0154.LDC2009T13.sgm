GIULIANI ' S BENEFITS FROM LAW FIRM ' S LOBBYING CLIENTS UNDER
SCRUTINY
</HEADLINE>

WASHINGTON
</P>
<P>
Presidential contender Rudolph Giuliani was paid at least $1.2
million by the Houston-based Bracewell &amp;amp; Giuliani law
firm that has represented energy firms, the smokeless tobacco
industry, drug companies and others with interests in government
policies.
</P>
<P>
The former New York mayor's bid for the Republican presidential
nomination has brought more national attention to the firm, as
designed. But it has also led to critical scrutiny of clients the
firm has represented to Congress and federal and state agencies.
</P>
<P>
Giuliani has not been directly involved in the lobbying in
Washington but he financially benefits from the business.
Candidates' financial disclosures, for January 2006 through this
week, were made public Wednesday and revealed for the first time
Giuliani's compensation at the law firm, which he joined in 2005.
</P>
<P>
In addition to his annual salary, Giuliani also receives a 7.5
percent share in the revenue of the firm's New York office,
according to his report, and the dollar amount for him has not
been calculated yet for the time period.
</P>
<P>
Some of Giuliani's other income sources yielded much more,
including $11.3 million in speakers fees and $4.1 million from
his New York-based Giuliani and Company.
</P>
<P>
Lee Miringoff, director of the Marist College Institute of Public
Opinion in New York, said that Giuliani's law firm connections
have helped him in fundraising in Texas and will not likely hurt
him in GOP primaries dominated by business-friendly conservative
voters.
</P>
<P>
Bracewell &amp;amp; Giuliani employees have so far given $67,000
to the Giuliani campaign, according to an analysis by the
independent Center for Responsive Politics. Pat Oxford, the
firm's managing partner and a major GOP fundraiser in Texas,
chairs Giuliani's presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
But Miringoff and other experts said the candidate's corporate
ties and potential for conflicts of interest if he is elected to
White House could hurt him among Democrats and independents, who
may see a less appealing side to the candidate cast as the steely
leader who guided New York City through the aftermath of the
Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.
</P>
<P>
In 2006 the law firm received $5.7 million in lobbying fees from
81 clients that range from large energy-related companies and
their associations to local school districts and groups such as
the FBI Agents Association.
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists have criticized the law firm for forming a
subsidiary called Electric Reliability Coordinating Council which
lobbied the Bush administration to block Clinton administration
lawsuits to force coal-fired plants to install pollution
controls. Another client, the National Petrochemical and Refiners
Association, has opposed any mandatory efforts to reduce
reductions of carbon dioxide.
</P>
<P>
"They have been by far the most articulate advocates for some of
the biggest polluters in town," said Frank O'Donnell, president
of Clean Air Watch, an environmental group.
</P>
<P>
Scott Segal, who oversees Bracewell &amp;amp; Giuliani's
operation in Washington and volunteered that he is a Democrat,
defended the law firm's client list.
</P>
<P>
"The industrial companies we represent produce goods and services
that are essential to the American quality of life," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Giuliani campaign declined to respond to questions about
whether his role at the law firm posed potential conflict of
interest or political problems.
</P>
<P>
"Mayor Giuliani is proud of the success he has achieved during
his long career," it said in a written statement.
</P>
<P>
Segal said Giuliani has not been involved in any of the lobbying
work in the nation's capital. He said Giuliani had been
instrumental in building up the 40-person New York office and
"has raised the stature of the law firm worldwide."
</P>
<P>
The firm employs 400 lawyers and consultants. Segal said Giuliani
has offered strategic advise to clients and until recently
participated in the firm's Monday morning video-conferences among
its offices.
</P>
<P>
Giuliani has been directly involved in another controversial case
involving Perdue, the manufacturer of the painkiller OxyContin,
which last week pleaded guilty to falsely marketing the drug as
being less addictive than it turned out to be.
</P>
<P>
Representing the firm, Giuliani was was one of Perdue's attorneys
and met with government lawyers in an effort to settle the case
several months ago.
</P>
<P>
In Austin, the law firm represented Citgo Petroleum Co.
controlled by Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, who has been
criticized by Giuliani and others for his anti-American rhetoric.
The firm recently ended its contract with Citgo.
