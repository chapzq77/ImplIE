in Massachusetts

Massachusetts Sen. Edward Kennedy remained in the hospital,
awaiting test results Monday that could explain why the 76-year-
old Democrat suffered a seizure a day earlier.
</P>
<P>
Doctors at Massachusetts General Hospital said it would be Monday
at the earliest before the tests were complete, and the hospital
and Kennedy's office released no new information about his
condition on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Kennedy was resting, eating and watching the Boston Red Sox
baseball game and the Boston Celtics basketball game on
television Sunday, said a top aide who requested anonymity
because the family had asked that details of the senator's
hospital stay not be released.
</P>
<P>
Kennedy's wife, Vicki, was seen walking into the hospital early
Sunday morning. The aide said his daughter, stepdaughters and
sister Jean Kennedy Smith also visited during the day.
</P>
<P>
It was a smaller crowd than on Saturday, when members of his
family, including Kennedy's sons and niece Caroline Kennedy, and
Sen. John Kerry went to the hospital.
</P>
<P>
Kennedy was flown Saturday morning to Massachusetts General from
the emergency room of Cape Cod Hospital, near his home in
Hyannisport. Doctors originally suspected he had suffered a
stroke, but his physician, Dr. Larry Ronan, later said it had
been a seizure and that the senator was "not in any immediate
danger."
</P>
<P>
In October, Kennedy had surgery to remove a blockage in his left
carotid artery, which supplies blood to the face and brain. After
the surgery, the 76-year-old resumed his busy schedule on Capitol
Hill and across Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
Kennedy is the second-longest serving member of the Senate and a
dominant figure in national Democratic Party politics. He was
elected in 1962, filling out the term won by his brother, John F.
Kennedy, who was elected president in 1960.
</P>
<P>
His eldest brother, Joseph, was killed in a World War II airplane
crash, while President Kennedy was assassinated in 1963 and a
third brother, Robert, was assassinated while campaigning for
president in 1968.
