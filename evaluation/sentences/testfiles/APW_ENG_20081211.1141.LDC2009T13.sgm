Lukoil, Russia's largest privately owned oil company, said
Thursday that third-quarter profit rose by 40 percent as the
company benefited from soaring oil prices and high refining
margins.
</P>
<P>
Lukoil, which is 20-percent owned by U.S. oil major
ConocoPhillips, said net profit for the quarter reached $3.5
billion, up from $2.5 billion for the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
But the company warned that a worsening economic environment,
which has seen oil prices plummet by 70 percent since July,
signals a difficult period ahead for oil companies.
</P>
<P>
"Crude oil prices are now close to the level at which development
of many oilfields becomes unprofitable," said Lukoil in a
statement. "If the trend lasts, a concern over a shortage of
hydrocarbon supply may appear."
</P>
<P>
Russia is expected to report a small decline in oil production
this year, its first annual decline in a decade.
