LCD Flat-Screen TVs on Downward Pricing Trend
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If you've been waiting for fast-falling prices of LCD flat-screen
TVs to flatten out, you can stop. Now's the time to buy.
</P>
<P>
Or maybe not.
</P>
<P>
Prices have been basically stalled since the retail wars of the
2006 holidays, when LCD TVs, once luxury items, went almost
mainstream. But prices will probably plunge again by the end of
the year.
</P>
<P>
A 42-inch set currently selling for an average $1,877 could be
going for $1,175 -- a drop of more than 35 percent -- just in
time for the winter holidays, the iSuppli research group said
Tuesday. Already, at some discount and membership stores, you can
find an off-brand 42-inch LCD set for under $1,000.
</P>
<P>
``I have a 20-inch LCD set across from me that was $1,500 just
four years ago. Now I could get it for $149,'' said Richard
Doherty of the Envisioneering Group. ``The prices have fallen
faster than any consumer electronics item in years, with the
exception of DVD players.''
</P>
<P>
If the price falls as much as expected this year, the average
42-inch LCD set will cost only about $80 less than a plasma flat-
screen of the same size. For years, plasma was the undisputed
flat-screen king, largely because the technology was far cheaper.
But now LCDs could rule -- especially among the environmentally-
and weight-conscious.
</P>
<P>
``LCD TVs use a lot less electricity,'' Doherty said. ``People
who consider themselves green tend to buy LCD. And the weight of
two 37-inch LCD TVs are about equal to that of one plasma set the
same size.''
</P>
<P>
Right now, LCD sets have 22 percent of the market. The iSuppli
group predicts that will rise to 51 percent in 2009.
</P>
<P>
This year, the number of raw LCD screens -- each of which
contains a liquid crystal gel divided into hundreds of thousands
of individual pixels -- shipping from factories will reach 75.2
million, up from 52.7 in 2006, iSuppli said. And the price of the
screens to TV manufacturers is forecast to fall 17 percent in
just the first half of this year.
</P>
<P>
That will likely to be passed onto shoppers. At the stores,
competition is fierce.
</P>
<P>
``At the beginning of 2006, we were seeing 42-inch LCDs at about
$3,500 or $4,000,'' said Ross Rubin, an analyst with the NPD
Group. ``But they were from just a handful of manufacturers. By
the end of the year, many more manufacturers were offering LCDs
and there was very aggressive retail discounting during the
holidays.''
</P>
<P>
What's good for shoppers, though, doesn't necessarily make
manufacturers and retailers happy.
</P>
<P>
In December, ``some of the 32-inch brands were as low as $500,''
said Riddhi Patel, an analyst with iSuppli. ``That's an awesome
price for the consumer but it was hard on everyone in the TV
supply chain because it was such a low profit margin.''
</P>
<P>
Since then, LCD prices have stayed nearly the same, or gone
slightly up in some cases.
</P>
<P>
But if the experts are right, it's only a rest period between
rounds.
