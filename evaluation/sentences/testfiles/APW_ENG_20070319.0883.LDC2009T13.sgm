NEW YORK 2007-03-19 15:31:25 UTC

<P>
Three police officers surrendered Monday to face charges in the
fatal shooting of an unarmed black man on his wedding day, an
incident that stirred outrage around New York City.
</P>
<P>
The officers were accused of firing nearly 50 shots at three
young men in a car outside a nightclub, killing Sean Bell and
seriously wounding two of his friends. Two other officers
involved were not indicted.
</P>
<P>
The eight-count indictment charges detectives Michael Oliver, who
fired 31 times, and Gerard Isnora, a decorated undercover officer
who fired 11 shots, with first-degree and second-degree
manslaughter, Queens District Attorney Richard Brown said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Those charges are classified as violent felonies with mandated
jail time if the men are convicted. The maximum punishment for
manslaughter is 25 years, Brown said.
</P>
<P>
Detective Marc Cooper, who fired four shots, faces a misdemeanor
endangerment charge, Brown said.
</P>
<P>
The shooting led to accusations of racism against the NYPD. Bell
was black, as are the other victims; three of the officers are
black, and two are white.
</P>
<P>
Arraignment was set for Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
"This grand jury acted in the most responsible and conscientious
fashion," said Brown. "This was a case that was, I'm sure, not
easy for them to resolve."
</P>
<P>
Grand jurors declined to indict on the more serious counts of
second-degree murder, and attempted murder, or the lesser charge
of criminally negligent homicide.
</P>
<P>
"We are a long way from a conviction," said defense attorney
Philip Karasyk, who represents Isnora.
</P>
<P>
Bell was killed Nov. 25 as he left his bachelor party.
</P>
<P>
Police have said the officers were involved in an undercover
investigation at the nightclub when they overheard a conversation
that convinced them the men were going to their car to retrieve a
gun. They have said that Bell's car hit the unmarked police
vehicle and that the officers believed someone in Bell's car was
reaching for a gun when they opened fire. No gun was found.
