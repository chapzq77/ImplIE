Hitachi annual losses widen, but growth seen ahead
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Japanese electronics maker Hitachi Ltd. said Tuesday its annual
net loss widened as it restructured its hard-hit flat-panel
business, but it forecast a return to profit in the current year.
</P>
<P>
Hitachi said it was hopeful for growing demand in China of its
flat-screen TVs, whose sales have languished in the face of
falling prices and intense competition with larger electronics
companies.
</P>
<P>
Hitachi said it also enjoyed steady growth in its power industry
business, particularly nuclear energy.
</P>
<P>
The company posted a net loss of 58.1 billion yen (561 million
dollars) in the year through March, steeper than the 32.8 billion
yen loss posted the previous year, a statement said.
</P>
<P>
But the loss was better than its projection made in March of a 70
billion yen loss thanks to better-than-expected profit at its
information and power industry sectors.
</P>
<P>
The loss was largely due to restructuring costs. Operating profit
grew 89 percent to 345.5 billion yen and sales also rose 10
percent to 11.227 trillion yen.
</P>
<P>
Losses related to its flat television business came to 100
billion yen for the year, and it is "still difficult" to expect
profit for the sector in the current year, said Toyoaki Namakura,
senior vice president and chief financial officer.
</P>
<P>
The company will concentrate on promotion of flat TV sales at
home and in China, where demand for flat TVs is surging, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The market is growing rapidly in the world, but we cannot do
everything quickly," Nakamura told a news conference. "So we will
strengthen operations in Japan and China."
</P>
<P>
Hitachi plans to sell 900,000 plasma displays and 1.2 million
LCDs (liquid crystal displays) globally for the current year, up
from 850,000 and 760,000 for the previous year respectively.
</P>
<P>
Hitachi is the second-biggest plasma TV producer after Panasonic
maker Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., while Sony Corp. and
Sharp Corp. have led the charge on LCDs.
</P>
<P>
For the current fiscal year to March 2009, Hitachi forecast a net
profit of 40 billion yen and an operating profit up 10 percent to
380 billion yen. Revenue was expected to be almost flat at 11.1
trillion yen.
</P>
<P>
"We have set moving into the black as our prime goal," Nakamura
said.
</P>
<P>
Monday's massive earthquake in China damaged a factory of
Hitachi's Chengdu joint venture, which has 200 workers producing
inverters, but the company continued some operations.
</P>
<P>
While damage to the factory was limited, the entire impact of the
quake on Hitachi's operations in China remained unknown, Nakamura
said.
</P>
<P>
"We still don't know about what is going to be happening," he
said.
