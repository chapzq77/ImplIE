Cycling: Zabel wins a week after doping confession
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Exactly a week after his EPO confession, German cyclist Erik
Zabel claimed his first victory of the season when he won the
second stage of the Tour of Bavaria on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
It has been a huge week for the six-time winner of the Tour de
France green jersey, who confessed last Thursday that he took the
banned blood booster erythropoietin (EPO) while competing for
German team Telekom in 1996.
</P>
<P>
His current employers, Team Milram, only announced on Tuesday
they had decided to honour his contract until 2008 after a crisis
meeting and a decision on whether Zabel will ride for them next
season is yet to be made.
</P>
<P>
But the 36-year-old showed the stress has not affected his
cycling as he claimed victory after the 187.8 km stage between
Gundelfingen to Eichstatt.
</P>
<P>
The Milram captain asserted himself over some stiff competition
from team-mate Sebastian Siedler and Australian Stuart O'Grady.
</P>
<P>
Zabel led throughout the long climb and will boost his chances of
winning the five-day event.
