Pitcher Yu Darvish went the distance Saturday as the Nippon Ham
Fighters defeated Bobby Valentine's Chiba Lotte Marines 5-2 in
the opening game of the Pacific League championship series.
</P>
<P>
Darvish struck out eight while giving up five hits in a 133-pitch
effort. He walked only one batter.
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to pitch a game our fans could enjoy," said Darvish.
"The team gave me some runs and I was able to hold them once we
got a lead."
</P>
<P>
Darvish, whose father is Iranian and mother is Japanese, is
widely regarded as the best pitcher in Japan professional
baseball.
</P>
<P>
Relying on a 150-kilometer fastball and an array of offspeed
pitches, Darvish kept Lotte's batters off balance in the game
played before a crowd of 42,000 at Sapporo Dome.
</P>
<P>
Darvish was among 34 players named Friday to a provisional squad
for Japan's team in December's Asian baseball qualifiers for the
Beijing Olympics.
</P>
<P>
The 21-year-old right-hander is preparing to drop his Iranian
nationality so he can represent Japan in the Beijing Olympics.
</P>
<P>
He went 15-5 with a 1.82 ERA this season for Trey Hillman's
Fighters, who finished first in the Pacific League and are the
defending Japan Series champions.
</P>
<P>
The Marines defeated the Softbank Hawks two games to one in the
first round of the playoffs to advance to the best-of-five series
against the Fighters.
</P>
<P>
The winner of this series will advance to the Japan Series to
take on the Central League champions.

<P>
In the first round of the Central League playoffs, Tyrone Woods
hit a two-run home run in the first inning at Nagoya Dome and
Masahiko Morino added a three-run homer in the sixth as the
Chunichi Dragons coasted to a 7-0 win over the Hanshin Tigers.
