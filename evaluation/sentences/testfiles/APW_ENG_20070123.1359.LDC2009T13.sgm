<P>
Oil and gas company Devon Energy Corp. on Tuesday said it plans
to sell all its assets in West Africa and focus instead on North
America, Brazil and China.
</P>
<P>
The company, which is one of the world's leading independent oil
and gas producers, plans to use any proceeds to pay off debt and
buy back stock.
</P>
<P>
The properties -- including an interest in a field operated by
Exxon Mobil Corp. in Equatorial Guinea -- held estimated proved
reserves of about 90 million barrels of oil equivalent as of Dec.
31, or about 4 percent of Devon's total proved reserves. "Proved
reserves" refers to crude oil and natural gas that is "reasonably
certain" to be commercially producible using current technology
at current prices.
</P>
<P>
Devon said it expects production of about 11 million barrels of
oil equivalent in 2007 from the properties, which are also in
Gabon and Cote d'Ivoire on Africa's western coast.
</P>
<P>
The company sees greater opportunities in the Gulf of Mexico,
where it is drilling 30,000 feet (9,000 meters) down to produce
oil.
</P>
<P>
"The significant growth opportunities we have developed onshore
in North America and in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico are
providing compelling rationale for redeploying our financial and
intellectual capital in these areas," President John Richels
said.
</P>
<P>
"As a result of the West African divestitures, we will sharpen
our focus in North America," he said. "At the same time we will
be concentrating our international operations in Brazil and
China, where we have established competitive advantages."
</P>
<P>
Company spokesman Chip Minty said political instability in West
Africa did not factor into the divestiture decision.
</P>
<P>
Goldman Sachs &amp; Co. and Scotia Waterous will manage the asset
sales. Sale agreements are expected in the second half of the
year.
