Philippine cardinal calls for an end to political killings -- by
military and rebels

All political killings are bad, whether perpetrated by government
troops or communist rebels, an influential Roman Catholic
cardinal in the Philippines said in reports published Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The comments by the archbishop of Manila, Cardinal Gaudencio
Rosales, come in the wake of accusations by left-wing and human
rights groups blaming the Philippine military for the killing,
abduction and torture of hundreds of political activists since
President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo came to power in 2001.
</P>
<P>
"We should tell the government as well as the rebels that it is
wrong to kill," Rosales said in comments published in major
newspapers Tuesday. "It is not one-sided. It is both sides."
</P>
<P>
Presidential spokesman Ignacio Bunye said the cardinal's words
were "fair."
</P>
<P>
Arroyo's government denies supporting abuses against political
activists, and insists it is taking action to stop them. It has
appealed for help from the European Union with forensic
investigations.
</P>
<P>
Bunye said the government would also welcome the participation of
the U.N. human rights commission and the U.S. government "in the
fight versus wrong and the quest for impartial justice."
</P>
<P>
Military officials say they are investigating the alleged
involvement of some soldiers in the killings, but blame most on
communist guerrillas who they say are conducting an internal
purge.
</P>
<P>
"The government should be told (not to kill anyone), and that's
what we are doing," Rosales said.
</P>
<P>
"To our brothers in the mountains, it is also wrong to kill," he
said, referring to the communist rebels. "They also kill. Sorry
for saying that, (but) it comes to the same thing. That's equally
wrong."
</P>
<P>
While acknowledging the situation in the Philippines is alarming,
Rosales dismissed claims by some leftist groups that it was as
bad as 1972-1981, when late dictator Ferdinand Marcos imposed
martial law, and thousands were killed, imprisoned and tortured
and basic rights suppressed.
</P>
<P>
"What's going on now is nothing as compared to martial law," he
said.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, Communist Party spokesman Gregorio Rosal called
Rosales' comments "gravely unfortunate," and said they belittled
the gravity of the situation. He said the current government's
human rights record is "not far" from that of the Marcos
administration.
</P>
<P>
Local human rights group Karapatan has reported more than 800
people, mostly left-wing activists and human rights workers, have
been killed and about 200 others have disappeared.
</P>
<P>
It alleged the government has adopted a counterinsurgency plan
targeting not only communist guerrillas but civilian groups
perceived by the military to be part of the rebel network.
</P>
<P>
The rebels have been fighting for a Maoist state for 38 years and
are included on U.S. and European list of terrorist
organizations.
