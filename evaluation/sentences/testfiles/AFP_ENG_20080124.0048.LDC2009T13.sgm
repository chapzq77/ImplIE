US not interested in permanent Iraq bases: Gates
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The United States has no interest in setting up permanent bases
in Iraq, US Defense Secretary Robert Gates said Thursday, playing
down concerns raised by negotiations on the future US military
presence in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Democratic critics have expressed fears that a planned "Status of
Forces Agreement" (SOFA) with Iraq will tie the hands of future
US presidents by committing the United States to a long-term
military presence.
</P>
<P>
But Gates said, "I think it is pretty clear that such an
agreement would not talk about force levels. It would not involve
-- we have no interest in permanent bases," he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"I think the way to think about the framework agreement is an
approach to normalizing the relationship between the United
States and Iraq," he added.
</P>
<P>
Some Democrats, including Senator Joe Biden, chairman of the
Foreign Relations Committee, have demanded that any agreement be
sent to the US Congress for approval.
</P>
<P>
Gates insisted discussions on the SOFA have barely begun and it
is not yet clear what form it will take.
</P>
<P>
"I do know that there's a strong commitment inside the
administration to consult very closely with the Congress on
this," Gates said.
</P>
<P>
"But, you know, without any idea of what the form of an agreement
is going to be right now, I think it's premature to talk about
congressional agreement or executive agreement. I think we just
don't know," he said.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman Tom Casey earlier said negotiations on
a status of forces agreement with Iraq aimed to keep security
options open beyond 2008 when the UN mandate for US forces ends.
</P>
<P>
For example, he added, it would give US forces the option of
continuing to hunt members of Al-Qaeda and train Iraqi troops.
</P>
<P>
Such an agreement "is very much the model that we use for regular
bilateral relations between the United States and most other
countries in the world," Casey said.
</P>
<P>
When asked if the agreement would include any reference to
permanent bases, he replied: "We're not seeking permanent bases
in Iraq. That's been a clear matter of policy for some time. No,
the agreement is not a basing agreement."
</P>
<P>
Asked how Washington would respond if Baghdad asked for bases, he
replied a distinction had to be made between the legal foundation
on which US troops operate over a given term and tactical
decisions on how to proceed.
</P>
<P>
"Those are the decisions that are made by US commanders on the
ground, working with their Iraqi counterparts, and ultimately
blessed by policy makers," he said.
</P>
<P>
"There is no anticipation that this is somehow going to forever
lock in stone a particular level of troops or a particular set of
activities or goals.  Again, it's a legal framework," he said.
