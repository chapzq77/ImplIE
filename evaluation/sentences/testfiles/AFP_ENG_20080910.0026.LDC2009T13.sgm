Golf: Wie headed to LPGA Q-school
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Michelle Wie will tackle a different type of school next week as
she bids to earn playing privileges on the LPGA Tour in the first
round of qualifying school.
</P>
<P>
The LPGA Wednesday confirmed reports that Wie would open her bid
to qualify at the sectional qualifying tournament at Mission
Hills Country Club in Rancho Mirage, California, east of Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
Wie will be making her first Q-school bid, having failed to earn
enough money playing on sponsor's exemptions to book a spot in
the tour.
</P>
<P>
In all, 164 players from 19 countries will bid to advance from
the 72-hole tournament, which will be played on the Palmer and
Dinah Shore Courses at Mission Hills Country Club.
</P>
<P>
Mission Hills is the site where Wie exploded on the golf scene,
playing in the final group of the Kraft Nabisco Championship when
she was just in the eighth grade.
</P>
<P>
But Wie has struggled since she turned pro at 16, and hasn't won
a tournament since the Women's Amateur Public Links in 2003, when
she was just 13.
</P>
<P>
Wie battled wrist injuries in 2007, and while she has shown signs
of recovery this year she was hindered by a disqualification in
the final round of the LPGA State Farm Classic in July, for
leaving the scoring area before signing her card. She tied for
12th in the Canadian Women's Open.
</P>
<P>
The top 30 players and ties will advance to the LPGA final
qualifying tournament December 3-7 in Daytona Beach, Florida.
</P>
<P>
They will be joined by the top 30 finishers from a second
sectional tournament, to be played September 30-October 3 at
Plantation Golf and Country Club's Bobcat and Panther Courses in
Venice, Florida.
</P>
<P>
The final qualifying field will also include current LPGA Tour
members attempting to improve their priority standing and the 10
players finishing 6th through 15th on the 2008 Duramed FUTURES
Tour season-ending money list.
