OAKLAND, California 2007-04-12 06:52:38 UTC
</P>
<P>
Darin Erstad hit a go-ahead sacrifice fly in the ninth after
Jermaine Dye connected for a tying two-run homer an inning
earlier, and the Chicago White Sox beat the Oakland Athletics 6-3
on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The A's scored all of their runs in the first inning off Mark
Buehrle, who settled down to hold Oakland to four hits in seven
innings, retiring 17 of his final 18 batters. David Aardsma (1-0)
pitched a perfect eighth for the win and Bobby Jenks finished for
his second save, one day after blowing a chance in Chicago's 2-1
loss.
</P>
<P>
Devil Rays 6, Rangers 5
</P>
<P>
At Arlington, Texas, Carlos Pena and Ben Zobrist helped the Tampa
Bay Devil Rays to a rare road victory.
</P>
<P>
Zobrist hit a solo homer in the first and Pena homered in a four-
run third inning for Tampa Bay, just 5-36 on the road since last
June 30.
</P>
<P>
Michael Young homered twice for the Rangers, who had won four of
their previous five.
</P>
<P>
Tampa Bay starter James Shields (1-0) allowed one run and two
hits over the first five innings before the Rangers rallied with
a four-run sixth. Shields gave up five runs on five hits over
seven innings. He had a career-high eight strikeouts and walked
one.
</P>
<P>
Al Reyes got three outs for his second save.
</P>
<P>
Rangers starter Robinson Tejeda (1-1) allowed six runs on 10 hits
in five innings.
</P>
<P>
Blue Jays 7, Royals 4
</P>
<P>
At Toronto, Troy Glaus homered and reached base four times, and
Aaron Hill had three hits and three RBIs for Toronto.
</P>
<P>
Gustavo Chacin (1-0) allowed three runs and five hits in five-
plus innings as the Blue Jays won for the fourth time in five
games. B.J. Ryan pitched a perfect ninth for his third save in
four chances.
</P>
<P>
Jorge De La Rosa (1-1) gave up five runs -- four earned-- and
nine hits in 5 2-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
David DeJesus homered for Kansas City (3-6), back in the American
League Central cellar, its usual home.
</P>
<P>
Glaus was 2-for-2 with two walks and three runs for Toronto
(5-3), striking to overtake the New York Yankees and Boston in
the AL East.
</P>
<P>
Alex Rios extended his hitting streak to eight games with a two-
run double in the fourth that put Toronto ahead for good at 3-2.
</P>
<P>
Tigers 4, Orioles 1, 12 innings
</P>
<P>
At Baltimore, Craig Monroe hit a grand slam with two outs in the
12th inning, and Detroit limited Baltimore to six hits.
</P>
<P>
Monroe's first homer of the season was his third hit of the game
and third career grand slam.
</P>
<P>
Ivan Rodriguez opened the 12th with a single off Kurt Birkins
(0-1), the eighth Baltimore pitcher. With two outs, Magglio
Ordonez reached on an infield hit and Carlos Guillen walked
before Monroe got his clutch hit on a 1-1 pitch.
</P>
<P>
Wilfredo Ledezma (1-0) allowed one hit in two innings for the
win.
</P>
<P>
Detroit starter Justin Verlander gave up three hits in seven
scoreless innings. He walked three, hit a batter and struck out
five. He has not given up an earned run in 13 innings this season
but is 0-0 after two starts.
</P>
<P>
Twins 5, Yankees 1
</P>
<P>
At Minneapolis, Ramon Ortiz dominated for eight innings, and his
Minnesota teammates revived their bats against Kyle Farnsworth.
</P>
<P>
Alex Rodriguez's fourth-inning sacrifice fly was the only damage
against Ortiz (2-0), who allowed three hits and one walk before
yielding to Joe Nathan for the ninth. Ortiz struck out Rodriguez
twice and stopped A-Rod's home run streak at four games.
</P>
<P>
New York starter Mike Mussina strained his left hamstring and
departed in the third inning. No. 1 starter Chien-Ming Wang
already is on the disabled list with a hamstring injury and
pitching prospects Jeff Karstens and Humberto Sanchez also are on
the DL.
</P>
<P>
Farnsworth (0-1) got only one out in the eighth inning, which
began with a walk to Luis Castillo. Singles by Joe Mauer and
Michael Cuddyer and doubles by Justin Morneau and Torii Hunter
drove in runs to break open the game.
</P>
<P>
Mariners 3, Red Sox 0
</P>
<P>
At Boston, fans were treated to a great pitching performance in
Daisuke Matsuzaka's Fenway Park debut -- only it was by Felix
Hernandez.
</P>
<P>
Seattle's pitching phenom didn't allow a hit until J.D. Drew
singled on his first pitch of the eighth inning, overshadowing
the first major league matchup between Dice-K and Ichiro Suzuki.
</P>
<P>
Hernandez (2-0), three days past his 21st birthday, pitched a
one-hitter for his third career complete game. Hernandez struck
out six and walked two, and remained unscored upon in 17 innings
this season.
</P>
<P>
Before a crowd of 36,630, Matsuzaka (1-1) allowed three runs and
eight in seven innings, striking out four and walking one.
</P>
<P>
Sukuzi went 0-for-5 in the game, with four of those at-bats
coming against Dice-K.
</P>
<P>
Angels 4, Indians 1
</P>
<P>
At Milwaukee, Joe Saunders allowed a run and four hits in 6 2-3
innings and Cleveland couldn't make it two in a row on its
makeshift new homefield.
</P>
<P>
Saunders (1-0), in the Angels' starting rotation because of
injuries to Bartolo Colon and Jered Weaver, pitched out of
trouble in the third inning, getting Ryan Garko to ground into a
double play after loading the bases with one out. He allowed only
one baserunner in the next three innings before giving up a solo
home run to Jhonny Peralta in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
Justin Speier finished the seventh inning for Saunders, and Scott
Shields pitched a scoreless eighth. Francisco Rodriguez retired
the side in order in the ninth for his fourth save in four
chances.
</P>
<P>
It was the second game in a three-game series that was moved from
Cleveland to Miller Park after snow showers wiped out the
Indians' four-game series against the Seattle Mariners over the
weekend, leaving unplayable conditions at Jacobs Field.
</P>
<P>
Indians starter Jake Westbrook (0-1) gave up three runs and five
hits in six innings, allowing four walks.
