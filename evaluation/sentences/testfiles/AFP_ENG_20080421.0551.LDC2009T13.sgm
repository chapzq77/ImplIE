Brain patterns predict mistakes: study
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

It turns out that dull tasks really do numb the brain.Researchers
have discovered that as people perform monotonous tasks, their
brain shifts towards an at-rest mode whether they like it or not.
</P>
<P>
And by monitoring that area of the brain, they were able to
predict when someone was about to make a mistake before they made
it, a study published Monday in the Proceedings of the National
Academy of Sciences found.
</P>
<P>
"There's this thing that's probably intrinsic where your brain
says I do need to take a little break here and there's nothing
you can do about it," said study author Tom Eichele of Norway's
University of Bergen.
</P>
<P>
"Probably everyone knows that feeling that sometimes your brain
is not as receptive or as well performing and you didn't do
anything to actually induce that."
</P>
<P>
When that happens, blood flows into the part of the brain which
is more active in states of rest.
</P>
<P>
And since this state begins about 30 seconds prior to a mistake
being made, it could be possible to design an early-warning
system which could alert people to be more focused or more
careful, Eichele said.
</P>
<P>
That could significantly improve workplace safety and also
improve performance in key tasks such as airport security
screening.
</P>
<P>
"We might be able to build a device (that could be placed) on the
heads of people that make these easy decisions," he told AFP.
</P>
<P>
"We can measure the signal and give feedback to the user that
well, your brain is in the state where your decisions are not
going to be the right one."
</P>
<P>
Eichele and his colleagues in the United States, Britain and
Germany were able to detect these brain patterns with MRI scans,
which are not portable.
</P>
<P>
The next step is to see if more mobile EEG devices are able to
detect the phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
A prototype of a wireless, mobile, and lightweight EEG amplifier
is currently in development and could be ready for the market in
10 to 15 years, he said.
