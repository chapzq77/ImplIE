Thai share prices rose 1.45 percent Wednesday after political
tension eased, with anti-government protesters leaving their
week-long blockade of Bangkok's two main airports, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
But they said the improved political climate could be short-lived
with the Thai parliament early next month expected to vote for a
new leader from the existing ruling coalition of parties.

The Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) composite index gained 5.60
points to close at 392.92 points while the bluechip SET-50 index
rose 4.93 points to 278.89.

<P>
Gainers outnumbered losers 187 to 97 with 115 stocks unchanged on
turnover of 2.7 billion shares worth 13.0 billion baht (365.5
million dollars).
</P>
<P>
The Thai baht rose slightly against the dollar to close at
35.55-57 baht to one dollar compared to Tuesday's close at
35.65-68.
</P>
<P>
The unit also edged up against the euro to close at 44.81-94 baht
to one euro compared to the previous day's close at 44.91-96.

<P>
"Investors remain concerned, despite protesters ending their
protest and withdrawing from the two airports.
</P>
<P>
"The same coalition will stick together and try to form a new
government," said Kosin Sripaiboon, an analyst at UOB Kay Hian
Securities.
</P>
<P>
Kosin said investors would adopt a wait-and-see approach until
the political situation becomes clearer.
</P>
<P>
He said the Bank of Thailand had made its steepest cut in
interest rates yet, by 100 basis points, but it had failed to
boost sentiment among cash-poor commercial banks.
</P>
<P>
PTT Plc added 1.00 baht to close at 144.00 baht on Wednesday,
while its subsidiary PTT Exploration and Production jumped 6.50
baht to 98.00. Banpu was unchanged at 180.00.
