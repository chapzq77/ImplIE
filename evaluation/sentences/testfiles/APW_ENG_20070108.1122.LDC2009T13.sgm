Philadelphia's two largest newspapers will be laying off 34
people in advertising, a union official said.
</P>
<P>
Advertising employees at The Philadelphia Inquirer, Philadelphia
Daily News and Philly.com were told of the layoffs on Monday,
said Henry Holcomb, president of The Newspaper Guild of Greater
Philadelphia. There are nearly 300 union members in advertising.

<P>
The layoffs take effect Jan. 22. Sixteen of the positions being
cut are part-time.
</P>
<P>
The advertising cuts come days after owner Philadelphia Media
Holdings laid off 71 editorial employees at the Inquirer. Three
people were offered jobs in another part of the company. That
amounted to 17 percent of the newspaper's editorial work force.

<P>
The Guild represents more than 900 editorial, advertising and
other staff at the papers.
