US bombs Shiite gang as Baghdad pilgrimage begins
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
American jets and helicopters bombed Baghdad's largest Shiite
slum on Wednesday, in a deadly strike targeting Iranian-backed
militia, as thousands of pilgrims thronged the streets of the
city.
</P>
<P>
The US military said 30 "terrorists" were killed in the overnight
strike on Sadr City, but families complained that women and
children were among the dead, and angry mourners gathered to bury
simple wooden caskets.
</P>
<P>
Helicopters and war planes were called in as Iraqi and US ground
troops arrested 12 members of a cell that American commanders
believe brought weapons and explosives from Iran, and sent
militants to Iran for training.
</P>
<P>
"During the course of the operation, the assault force and the
overhead aerial support observed a vehicle and large group of
armed men on foot attempting an assault on the ground forces,"
the military said.
</P>
<P>
"Responding appropriately to the threat of the organised
terrorist force, close air support was called and engaged the
terrorist vehicle and organised terrorist force, killing an
estimated 30 terrorists," the statement added.
</P>
<P>
Families said 11 people were killed in the US strike in the
teeming slum, a stronghold of radical Shiite cleric Moqtada Sadr,
including three children and four women. At least one house and a
truck were heavily damaged.
</P>
<P>
The military said the main target of the raid acted as a proxy
between the Iranian Revolutionary Guards' elite Quds Force but it
was unclear whether the individual was killed or captured during
the campaign.
</P>
<P>
It said all those killed -- another two gunmen were shot dead on
the ground -- or captured were thought to belong to a rogue
militia cell known for bringing among other things, explosively
formed penetrators or EFPs, from Iran.
</P>
<P>
EFPs fire a ball of molten metal capable of destroying heavily
armoured vehicles, and have been responsible for hundreds of
American deaths in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The renewed US accusations of Iranian interference -- which are
routinely denied by Tehran -- came as Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri
al-Maliki arrived in Tehran for talks on ways to improve security
in the country.
</P>
<P>
Pressing the diplomatic agenda elsewhere on ending Iraq's vicious
sectarian conflict, representatives of its neighbours and the
global community, including the United States and arch-foe Iran,
were also meeting in Damascus.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of thousands of Shiites converged on the war-torn
capital, marching through the streets under stringent security
and punishing heat to commemorate the death of a revered imam on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Iraq banned all vehicle traffic in the capital to guard against
the vicious car bombings that routinely target Shiite crowds and
have spread carnage at previous religious events, as security
forces manned checkpoints.
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, Shiites marching in memory of Imam Musa Kadhim
were gripped by panic after mortar shells were fired at the
mosque housing his tomb, amid rumours of suicide bombers in a
crowd crossing a bridge over the river Tigris.
</P>
<P>
At least 965 people -- many of them women and children -- were
trampled to death in a stampede or drowned after jumping into the
river, in the bloodiest tragedy of Iraq's sectarian conflict, one
still raw in the minds of many.
</P>
<P>
Set to last three days, the curfew cloaked the sweltering streets
of Baghdad in eery calm while men, women dressed from head to toe
in black, and children walked past army armoured cars and police
jeeps to Kadhim's tomb.
</P>
<P>
"Despite the security situation and the probable danger, this is
a special occasion for us that we can't miss and one of the most
important Shiite events," said Haidar Abdul Hussein, 33, from the
neighbourhood of Karrada.
</P>
<P>
Some 85,000 Iraqi and US troops have deployed in Baghdad since
February to flush out Sunni extremists and Shiite militias, but
the number of civilians killed has remained high and rose last
month to pre-surge levels.
</P>
<P>
Any major attack at this year's commemoration would be a further
blow for Maliki's shrinking government, now boycotted by 17
ministers from a spectrum of Shiite, Sunni and non-sectarian
parties.
</P>
<P>
Civilians are forbidden to carry weapons and Iraqi security
forces tightly controlled the route that pilgrims will follow on
foot to the imam's mausoleum in the Kadhimiyah district.
</P>
<P>
Musa Kadhim was the seventh of the 12 Shiite imams and died in
Baghdad in 799 after he was poisoned in prison. Every year tens
of thousands of Shiite pilgrims mark his passing by visiting his
tomb in Kadhimiyah.
