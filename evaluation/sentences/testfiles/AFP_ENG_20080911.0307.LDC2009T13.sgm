Eritrea slams Canada for denying FM a visa
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Eritrea on Thursday slammed a "hostile" Canada for denying its
foreign minister a visa over his participation in the country's
three-decade independence war against Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian High Commission in Kenya denied Osman Saleh Mohammed
a permit to travel to the country a few weeks ago, the foreign
ministry said in a statement from Asmara. He was to make a speech
to expatriate Eritreans.
</P>
<P>
"This muddled decision is difficult to decipher and understand by
any standards. The government of Eritrea strongly condemns this
hostile act and expressly requests the Canadian authorities to
rectify this outrageous conduct," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
It described the move as an "embarrassing aberration in
diplomatic conduct."
</P>
<P>
In addition, it released the High Commission's letter that said
Osman's involvement in the 1961-1991 independence war rendered
him inadmissible.
</P>
<P>
"Specifically, you were a member of the Eritrean People's
Liberation Front between 1979 and 1991. The EPLF was a group that
engaged in the subversion of a government by force."
</P>
<P>
"Canadian Federal Court jurisprudence confirms that membership in
a group that attempts to subvert even a despotic government is
sufficient to render inadmissibility," the letter read.
</P>
<P>
Osman was a member of the EPLF, which fought Ethiopian dictator
Haile Mengistu Mariam, whose regime slaughtered tens of thousands
until he was toppled in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Most western powers have kept former African rebels -- some in
power -- who participated in Cold-war era freedom struggles in
their terrorism watch lists despite having diplomatic ties.
</P>
<P>
In June, US lawmakers removed former South African president
Nelson Mandela and his African National Congress from a three-
decade old immigration watch list for possible terrorists.
