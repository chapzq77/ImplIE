ICE STORM SLICES THROUGH NEW ENGLAND
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nearly a million homes and businesses in New England are facing a
weekend without electricity after a rare combination of low
pressure, moist air, and cold, powerful winds Thursday night and
Friday produced a punishing ice storm that swept through the
region, felling countless power lines and trees and closing
hundreds of roads.
</P>
<P>
The storm, which has caused tens of millions of dollars in damage
throughout the region, led Governor Deval Patrick to declare a
state of emergency, allowing him to mobilize 500 members of the
National Guard to help clear roads and provide support. Patrick,
who estimated the cost to the state at about $7 million, said he
would seek a presidential disaster declaration to make federal
money available for recovery efforts.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think anyone is expecting the power will be back in
large numbers for a few days," Patrick said in a telephone
interview Friday night. "I think it could be longer than Monday
for certain parts of the Commonwealth. We'll know more after a
lot of the debris is cleared in the next few days."
</P>
<P>
No deaths or serious injuries were reported, but the storm left
utility companies grappling with unprecedented power outages.
</P>
<P>
As much as 4 inches of rain fell over the region from late
Tuesday night through Friday morning as a low-pressure system
from the south and a cold front from the north stalled over New
England. But the Boston area, which had only torrential rain, did
not experience the icing that areas outside Interstate 495 and
along the New Hampshire border did, where the rain immediately
froze on contact with the ground and everything else it touched.
</P>
<P>
"Nobody expected that the impact of this storm to be quite so
devastating," Worcester Mayor Konstantina Lukes said. "Trees are
falling on cars, they are falling on houses, and they are
trapping people in their homes."
</P>
<P>
In Massachusetts, about 326,000 customers lost electricity. In
New Hampshire, which also declared a state of emergency, more
than 400,000 homes and business were in the dark.
</P>
<P>
And in Maine, 200,000 lost power, according to the state's
emergency management agency. Connecticut Light &amp;amp; Power
reported that nearly 17,000 of its 1 million customers lost
service. In Vermont, at least 36,000 utility customers lost
electricity, and power went out for about 6,000 National Grid
customers in Rhode Island.
</P>
<P>
"What we're seeing is unprecedented in terms of New Hampshire
storms," said Martin Murray, a spokesman for Public Service of
New Hampshire, which provides electricity to about 72 percent of
the state. "We've never had any power outages approaching this.
Virtually every part of the state is affected, and the damage is
extensive."
</P>
<P>
With the number of work crews overburdened, New Hampshire and
Maine sought help from Canada.
</P>
<P>
"It's just a massive task, and there isn't a lot of mutual aid
available," said Lynette Miller, a spokeswoman for the Maine
Emergency Management Agency. "In terms of the effects and number
of outages, we haven't seen this many issues in a decade."
</P>
<P>
National Grid, which serves 1.2 million customers in
Massachusetts, had more than 650 crews working around the state
to repair power lines, and they called in help from as far as
Washington, D.C., and Ohio. "This is an extreme situation," said
Debbie Drew, a spokesman for National Grid. "This will be a
multiday restoration effort."
</P>
<P>
Throughout the region, the storm destroyed roofs, shuttered
businesses, and made just about everything more difficult. Trains
throughout the region were delayed or canceled. Crowds of
customers at hardware stores jostled to buy generators. Blood
banks collections were hampered.
</P>
<P>
"There's tons and tons of debris out there, which is impacting
the utilities' ability to restore power," said Peter Judge, a
spokesman for the Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency.
"It's as bad as we've seen at least over the last 10 years."
</P>
<P>
With signal systems down and trees blocking tracks, there was
also widespread disruption of service on all commuter rail trains
leaving North Station.
</P>
<P>
"This morning was as bad as it gets. ... Mother Nature wreaked
havoc," said Scott Farmelant, a spokesman for the Massachusetts
Bay Commuter Railroad Company.
</P>
<P>
There may have been at least one victim attributable to the
storm. Authorities in Marlborough were searching for Kevin
Connolly, 50, a Department of Public Works employee whose city-
issued truck was found abandoned by a creek behind the
department's parking lot.
</P>
<P>
He was last seen at about 4 a.m. Friday after he reported to work
and was dispatched to help sand roads and clear tree limbs.
</P>
<P>
"There has been an enormous amount of people" looking for him,
said Marlborough police Lieutenant Tom Boland.
</P>
<P>
Hardest hit in Massachusetts was northern Worcester County, where
more than 100,000 homes remained without electricity Friday
afternoon. Worcester had the additional problem of controlling
all the downed limbs, many of which are infested with Asian long-
horned beetles.
</P>
<P>
Worcester officials called on residents to leave the fallen
branches for street cleanup crews or take them to designated city
chipping centers, so the beetles do not spread to other areas.
"We were supposed to start removing the trees next week from
public property, but that might be delayed now," said Christina
Andreoli, a spokeswoman for City Manager Michael V. O'Brien.
</P>
<P>
Neighborhoods in the northern and western parts of Worcester were
most affected and three high schools were opened as emergency
shelters. An estimated 25,000 people there were without power
Friday night, she said.
</P>
<P>
On Ogden Avenue in Worcester, the problem was the once-massive
tree in Dave Rousseau's backyard. One branch broke off at about 3
a.m. and fell onto the cars and trucks in Rousseau's driveway,
denting and damaging hoods, roofs, and doors of the vehicles.
</P>
<P>
About an hour later, a tree trunk came to rest on a neighboring
three-decker.
</P>
<P>
"We've got to look on the bright side," Rousseau said. "No one
was hurt."
</P>
<P>
Downed trees and sagging power lines also made many roads
impassable in Fitchburg, Leominster, and Holden, where so much
ice and debris rained from trees that parents sent children
outside to play wearing bicycle helmets.
</P>
<P>
After spending the night before his birthday in the basement of
their single-story home in Holden, Mike Fahey awoke to find a
tree that cleaved into two separate trunks. "I took a picture and
I told my wife, 'These trees are coming down,"' he said.
</P>
<P>
Seconds later, both trunks gave way. One slammed onto the roof of
Fahey's home. "This is a not a good birthday," he said.
</P>
<P>
Every tree and utility wire in Holden seemed to be encased in
ice, some of which appeared to be an inch thick. Power and
utility lines were down on every street and some side roads were
blocked by fallen branches.
</P>
<P>
Utility lines sagged over Main Street, and residents flagged them
with cloth and pieces of plastic. On other streets, residents
built paths between piles of branches to guide drivers.
</P>
<P>
Authorities throughout the state also eyed cresting rivers.
</P>
<P>
The 2 to 4 inches of rain that fell during the storm caused minor
flooding. The headwaters of the Charles River in Medway rose just
above the flood stage, as did the Aberjona River in Winchester,
the Old Swamp River in South Weymouth, and the Jones Brook in
Billerica.
</P>
<P>
The good news to report is that the weather is improving.
</P>
<P>
With the storm now hovering somewhere over the Atlantic, the sun
will shine throughout the metropolitan area over the weekend,
said Alan Dunham, a meteorologist with the National Weather
Service in Taunton.
</P>
<P>
The temperature Saturday should reach a high of 29 degrees but
fall to 19 Saturday. night. Sunday, there will be a few more
clouds, but the temperature should rise into the 40s.
