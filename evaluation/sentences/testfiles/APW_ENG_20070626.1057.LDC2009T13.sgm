SOFIA, Bulgaria 2007-06-26 16:40:57 UTC

<P>
Nigeria coach Berti Vogts denied reports he has offered to take
over the Bulgarian national team, news reports said.
</P>
<P>
Bulgaria's state-run news agency BTA reported earlier Tuesday
that Vogts' manager Misha Stancovic said he had approached
Bulgaria's soccer federation with an offer from Vogt to become
the new coach of the team.
</P>
<P>
However, Vogts told German news agency DPA that he was not aware
of such an offer.
</P>
<P>
"That's the first I hear ot it," DPA quoted Vogts as saying.
</P>
<P>
BTA's report quoted Stancovic as saying he had "sent a fax to the
Bulgarian Football Union with an offer from Berti Vogts to take
over the Bulgarian national team, if union President Borislav
Mihailov and the union leadership agree."
</P>
<P>
The soccer federation would not say whether it had approached
Vogts about the job, and did not immediately comment on the
issue. It has previously said it wants to hire a foreigner as new
coach, after Hristo Stoitchkov resigned from the post in April.
</P>
<P>
Vogts, who led Germany to the European Championship in 1996 and
later coached Scotland, took over Nigeria's national team in
January.
</P>
<P>
Stoitchkov resigned in the wake of the team's poor performance in
qualifying for next year's European Championship. Levski Sofia
coach Stanimir Stoilov was appointed interim manager until a
permanent replacement is found.
</P>
<P>
Bulgaria is second in Euro 2008 qualifying Group G with 15
points, two behind Romania.
