LAWYERS SAY MCNAMEE HAS PHYSICAL EVIDENCE AGAINST CLEMENS
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Brian McNamee's lawyers are promising to deliver a bombshell on
Thursday against Roger Clemens.
</P>
<P>
McNamee, Clemens's former trainer, will produce "corroborative
physical evidence" for congressional investigators that he
injected Clemens with performance-enhancing drugs, the trainer's
lawyers said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to a lawyer familiar with the matter, McNamee had
syringes used to inject Clemens with steroids and human growth
hormone that still had traces of Clemens' blood. McNamee gave
those syringes to federal prosecutors last month when they came
to New York to meet with McNamee and his lawyer, Earl Ward.
</P>
<P>
McNamee has asserted that he injected Clemens with steroids and
human growth hormone from 1998 to 2001.
</P>
<P>
The lawyer said McNamee would sometimes inject Clemens at the
pitcher's apartment in New York and would then take the syringes
with him because he had a hazardous waste disposal at his own
home in Queens. The lawyer said McNamee still had some of those
syringes even after the Mitchell report was released last
December and that he gave them to Internal Revenue Service
special agent Jeff Novitzky. The lawyer said McNamee also had
gauze pads used to remove blood from Clemens' skin after
injections in 2000 and 2001. Those gauze pads have also been
turned over to federal investigators.
</P>
<P>
McNamee is scheduled to give a deposition to the House Oversight
committee on Thursday and his lawyers said his evidence would be
released publicly after his session with congressional staff
members.
</P>
<P>
Clemens gave a sworn deposition on Tuesday denying he had ever
used steroids or human-growth hormone.
</P>
<P>
"This will totally corroborate that Brian has been telling the
truth from the beginning," Ward, McNamee's lead lawyer, said in a
telephone interview. "It takes it out of the category of he-said,
he-said."
</P>
<P>
Another lawyer, Richard Emery, added, "Knoblauch and Pettitte and
all the other people who corroborate Brian are going to be much
less important than this physical evidence we provide." Chuck
Knoblauch and Andy Pettitte are former teammates of Clemens' and
former clients of McNamee's who have not denied McNamee's
allegations that he injected them with human-growth hormone.
</P>
<P>
McNamee has told federal investigators and former Sen. George J.
Mitchell, who produced a report on performance-enhancing drugs in
baseball, that he injected Clemens at least 16 times with
steroids and human-growth hormone.
</P>
<P>
Clemens flatly denied that assertion in a sworn deposition to
congressional investigators on Tuesday and in earlier public
statements. After a nearly five-hour, closed-door deposition on
Tuesday, Clemens told reporters, "It was great to be able to tell
them what I've been saying all along -- that I've never used
steroids or growth hormone."
</P>
<P>
McNamee's charges and Clemens' denials are the main focus of a
congressional investigation that is heading toward a House
Oversight committee hearing next Wednesday in which both men have
agreed to testify under oath. Lying to Congress is punishable by
up to five years in prison.
