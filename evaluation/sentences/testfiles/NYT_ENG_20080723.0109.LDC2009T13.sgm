FOR BRIDESMAIDS, DUTIES NOW INCLUDE GETTING BOTOX AND SPRAY TANS
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After the band was chosen and the napkins color-coordinated to
match her shoes, Kacey Knauer, a bride-to-be, had another
critical matter to address: her skin, and the skin of the nine
women in her bridal party.
</P>
<P>
So Knauer, the 35-year-old owner of TempTrends, a staffing agency
in Manhattan, invited her nearest and dearest -- including her
mother and future mother-in-law -- for a night out at the TriBeCa
MedSpa, replete with mimosas and cupcakes. An aesthetician
assessed each woman's face and devised a treatment plan -- a
quick chemical peel, say, or an injection of a wrinkle-filler. Or
maybe, for a bridesmaid with age spots, a series of Fraxel laser
treatments over months, allowing for recovery time.
</P>
<P>
For Knauer, who will be married in December, cosmetic
interventions for herself and her entourage are as vital as the
centerpieces or food. "If I were 25 or 26 and getting married, a
bracelet, necklace or matching earrings would be fine," she said.
</P>
<P>
But at 35? "Giving them a bracelet isn't as special as spending
an evening together. Plus, as you get older, everyone is more
conscientious about their skin and appearance," she said. "Giving
them something for themselves -- as opposed to something that
they'll never wear again -- is more meaningful."
</P>
<P>
And let's not forget the pictures of college roommates-turned-
bridesmaids quickly posted to Facebook. It is no longer
sufficient to hire a hairstylist and makeup artist to be on hand
the day of. Instead, bridal parties are indulging in dermal
fillers and tooth-whitening months before the Big Day.
</P>
<P>
Some brides pick up the tab for their attendants, replacing the
pillbox inscribed with the wedding date with a well-earned squirt
between the eyes. In other cases, bridesmaids -- who may quietly
seethe about unflattering dresses -- are surprisingly willing to
pay for cosmetic enhancements. "Most women, when they come in
here, they want it," said Camille Meyer, the owner of TriBeCa
MedSpa. "They know they're aging."
</P>
<P>
For Karen Hohenstein, who held her party at the Tiffani Kim
Institute Medical Wellness Spa in Chicago, convincing her friends
was as smooth as a Botoxed forehead. "It wasn't me saying, 'Hey,
we all could use a little something,"' she said. "It was, 'I want
to do this,' and a couple of people said, 'I do, too."'
</P>
<P>
But for every accommodating pal, there's another who feels going
under the knife is beyond the duty of bridesmaid. Becky Lee, 39,
a Manhattan photographer, declined when a friend asked her -- and
five other attendants -- to have their breasts enhanced. "We're
all Asian and didn't have a whole lot of cleavage, and she found
a doctor in L.A. who was willing to do four for the price of
two," said Lee, who wore a push-up bra instead.
</P>
<P>
Not for nothing are some maids known as slaves of honor, but this
kind of cajoling is a recent development on the wedding front.
</P>
<P>
Marie Scalogna-Watkinson, the founder of Spa Chicks on-the-Go, a
mobile spa, said she receives five to seven calls a month from
brides seeking Botox or Restylane for their bridesmaids. Five
years ago, collective makeovers were unheard of, she said.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Fardad Forouzanpour, a cosmetic surgeon in Beverly Hills,
Calif., said his business has increased more than 40 percent
since he began offering what he calls Bridal Beauty Buffets in
2006.
</P>
<P>
In the last two years, bridal party tuneups have increased
roughly 25 percent, estimated Susie Ellis, the president of
SpaFinder.com, a site that lists 4,500 spas worldwide.
</P>
<P>
Just as timing matters when it comes to securing a hall, it's
best that brides-to-be don't delay scheduling appointments,
aestheticians and doctors say. "You wouldn't get a cut and color
the week before," said Dr. Jessica Wu, a dermatologist in Beverly
Hills who advises coming in three to six months before the big
day. "We do a trial run of Botox about four months ahead of time.
Then, two weeks before the wedding, we do that last treatment."
</P>
<P>
Meyer of TriBeCa MedSpa suggests that a bride contact her the
minute the question is popped. "Brides really appreciate the fact
that we put everything in a regimented schedule for them," she
said. Since February 2007, she has staged more than 30 bridesmaid
parties and has 18 planned so far this year. "If you have to do
eight treatments, six weeks apart, that could take up to a year,"
she said.
</P>
<P>
Fraxel laser could also set you back $1,200 a session, which even
without the economic downturn, amounts to quite a bit. These
days, Robyn Bomar, an event planner in Destin, Fla., overhears
brides doing cost-benefit analyses. "They will never choose Botox
over a great dress, but they will say 'Maybe I'll have a buffet
over a sit-down at the rehearsal dinner,"' she said. Or: "I'll
spend the money on Botox rather than lunch."'
</P>
<P>
In June, Jennifer Peterson, 31, a production director in Los
Angeles, and eight friends indulged in Botox, Restylane,
massages, facials and microdermabrasion at Infinity MedSpa in
Valencia, Calif. Her friends chipped in for her treatments, but
she is considering giving them each a $100 certificate to the spa
-- a gift she is sure they will appreciate. "Everybody does Botox
out here," she said. The beauty procedure thank-you gift is
becoming more common, said Bomar, who coordinates about three
parties a month. Time was when the bride arranged for everyone to
get manicures at the same time, followed by lunch. But today?
"It's much more likely that she is footing the bill for eyelash
extensions, airbrush tanning and a bevy of other cosmetic
procedures," she said.
</P>
<P>
Five years ago, plastic surgeons, dermatologists and tooth-
whitening centers "were virtually absent" from bridal expos, said
William F. Heaton III, the president of the Great Bridal Expo
Group, which produces events in 40 cities nationwide. "Now we're
getting a half dozen phone calls a week."
</P>
<P>
This year alone, American Laser Centers, a chain, has
participated in 830 bridal shows, said Amanda McInnes, a
marketing director.
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, Health Travel Guides, a medical tourism company,
exhibited at the Dallas Bridal Show for the first time. "We
received 30 requests for quotes among the bridal show attendees
-- mostly for plastic surgery such as liposuction and breast
augmentation," said Sandra Miller, the company's chief marketing
officer. "But also many for cosmetic dentistry and inquiries for
providing quotes for bachelorette getaways that will feature
beauty treatments."
</P>
<P>
A bride's request that you whiten your grayish teeth can strain a
relationship. Samantha Goldberg, a wedding planner in Chester,
N.J., recalled a bride who asked her attendants to get
professionally spray-tanned for a Hawaiian-theme reception.
</P>
<P>
Alas, two women were claustrophobic and couldn't bear standing in
a tanning capsule. "They asked the bride if they could use
regular tanning cream from a salon," Goldberg said. The bride
refused; she wanted everyone to be the same shade. The women
ultimately declined to be bridesmaids. "Friendships of 20-plus
years gone over a spray tan?" Goldberg said. "Sad!"
</P>
<P>
And how does a bride break it to a mother-in-law that she'd love
her crow's feet to be frozen into submission? Very delicately.
</P>
<P>
"My mother is in her 60s. She's been talking about it for so
long, so I said 'Let's do it,"' said Stacey Berlin, 29, a
marketing consultant, who is having a party at Aquamedica Day Spa
in Long Branch, N.J.
</P>
<P>
It was trickier with her future mother-in-law. "To her," Berlin
said, "I said it as a joke: 'You should do Botox for the
wedding!' She giggled, and then I said, 'I'm serious. It's
exactly what you need to freshen up.' At first she kind of
laughed it off, but the more we talked about it and I told her my
mom was going to do it, she said 'OK."'
