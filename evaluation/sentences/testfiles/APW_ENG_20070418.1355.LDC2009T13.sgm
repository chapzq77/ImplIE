A freelance journalist who said she left New York's "rat race"
for the adventure of the Peace Corps was found dead Wednesday,
her body in a shallow grave in the northern Philippines where she
had gone to hike, officials said.
</P>
<P>
Police said they believed foul play was involved in the death of
Julia Campbell, 40, from Fairfax, Virginia, who came to the
country two years ago and had about two weeks left in an English-
teaching stint.
</P>
<P>
She went missing April 8 on a solo trip to see the famed
mountainside rice terraces of Banaue, in Ifugao province north of
Manila.
</P>
<P>
More than 80 police commandos, soldiers and volunteers had
searched for Campbell in the rugged area, backed by helicopters
and tracking dogs. Her body was found buried in a dry riverbed,
where a stray dog had dug out one of her feet.
</P>
<P>
Army spokesman Lt. Col. Ernesto Torres said officials at the site
confirmed that the body was Campbell's, saying she was wearing
the same clothes as when she was last seen buying soda from a
store in Batad town, not far from the grave site.
</P>
<P>
Her glasses were found near a trail about 50 meters (165 feet)
away, with one of the lenses laying nearby.
</P>
<P>
No cause of death was immediately available. Campbell's body was
being flown Thursday to Camp Crame, the national police
headquarters in Manila, where forensics experts were set to
examine it.
</P>
<P>
During the search, officials had speculated that Campbell might
have fallen off a cliff. But now they have opened a criminal
investigation.
</P>
<P>
"This is no longer an accident," Ifugao provincial police chief
Senior Superintendent Pedro Ganir told The Associated Press by
telephone.
</P>
<P>
Campbell had worked for The New York Times, People magazine,
Fox.com, CourtTV.com and Star Magazine, and had reported for CNN
on a December typhoon that hit the area where she was working for
the Peace Corps.
</P>
<P>
"At the age of 38, I decided to step out of the rat race of New
York, join the Peace Corps and board a plane for Manila,"
Campbell wrote in her blog.
</P>
<P>
Peace Corps director Ron Tschetter said Campbell, who was among
the organization's 137 volunteers currently in the Philippines,
"contributed greatly to the lives of Filipino citizens."
</P>
<P>
"Julia was a proud member of the Peace Corps family, and she
contributed greatly to the lives of Filipino citizens," Tschetter
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
He had traveled to the Philippines to join the search for
Campbell, and he praised the local police effort to find her as
"incredible."
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. Peace Corps is saddened by the loss of such a dedicated
and vibrant volunteer, who so loved this country," Tschetter
said. "Our hearts go out to her family and friends in the United
States."
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Philippine national police chief Oscar Calderon ruled
out communist rebels' involvement in Campbell's disappearance,
"because the area has been cleared of insurgents."
</P>
<P>
She had bought a bus ticket to return to Manila by April 9,
indicating she did not plan to extend her stay or make a long
hike to a spot to look at the rice terraces, he said.
</P>
<P>
"It's horrible," said Michael Cooper, a New York Times political
reporter who had worked with Campbell at the newspaper when they
covered New York City police.
</P>
<P>
"She was a very dogged, very hardworking reporter," Cooper said.
"She put in long hours. When doing street reporting, she was
always sure to ring the 10th doorbell, not just leave after a
few."
</P>
<P>
Cooper said that she left the Times to cover hard news for People
magazine, and that he had not talked to her for a couple of
years.
</P>
<P>
Campbell had been teaching English at the Divine Word College in
Albay province's Legazpi city, southeast of Manila, since October
2006.
</P>
<P>
She previously taught at a public school in Donsol in nearby
Sorsogon province, said Nora Gallano, assistant dean of Divine
Word's College of Liberal Arts.
</P>
<P>
"She just felt not fulfilled in New York, and shocked us when she
said she was joining the Peace Corps," said her aunt, Ann Knight,
of Pensacola, Florida. "She was doing what she wanted to do."
</P>
<P>
Knight described her niece as "a very adventuresome, very
interesting, loving, giving person who loved a good story."
</P>
<P>
Campbell had moved around a lot as a child because her father was
in the Marines. She graduated from high school in Fairfax, where
her mother still lives.
