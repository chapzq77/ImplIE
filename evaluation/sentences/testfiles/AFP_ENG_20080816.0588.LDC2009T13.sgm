Walker Valeriy Borchin held off former champion Jefferson Perez
of Ecuador on Saturday to hand Russia its first athletics gold of
the Beijing Olympics.Borchin won the men's 20 kilometres race
walk in 1hour 19minutes 01 second for Russia's first ever Olympic
walking success.
</P>
<P>
The 22-year-old, who served a one-year drugs ban in the 2005/06
season, beat home 1996 Olympic champion Perez by 14sec, with
Australian Jared Tallent a further 27sec adrift in the bronze
medal position.
</P>
<P>
"I never expected to win this medal," said Borchin, who opened up
the decisive gap over Perez with two kilometres to go.
</P>
<P>
"At the beginning, I was lagging behind. I feel my dream has come
true."

In the women's heptathlon, Ukraine's Nataliia Dobrynska retook
the overall lead after the fifth of the seven disciplines, the
long jump. Only the javelin throw and the 800m remain.
</P>
<P>
Dobrynska jumped a lead of 6.63m for 1049 points to take her
total to 5045pts, 16 ahead of overnight leader Hyleas Fountain of
the United States, whose best jump was measured at 6.38m.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine's Lyudmila Blonska drew level with Russian Anna Bogdanova
in third place on 4913pts, but it was not a good morning's work
for Briton Kelly Sotherton.
</P>
<P>
The pre-event favourite dropped two places to fifth after a poor
jump of 6.33m in her strongest event - with her weakest event,
the javelin throw, to come.
</P>
<P>
The women's 100m saw no surprises as the main favourites all
progressed to the second round of heats later Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Among the 40 runners advancing were the American trio of Torri
Edwards, Athens silver medallist Lauryn Williams and Muna Lee, as
well as Jamaican stars Kerron Stewart and Sherone Simpson, all
expected to challenge for gold.
</P>
<P>
In the field, women's shot put favourites Valerie Vili of New
Zealand and Belarussian Nadzeya Ostapchuk both qualified for the
final later Saturday with their first efforts.
</P>
<P>
Chinese pair Gong Lijiao and Li Meiju recorded the second and
third best first round efforts, both setting personal bests and
lining up what should be a close- fought final.
</P>
<P>
Other finals on Saturday, the second day of competition at the
National Stadium, include the men's 100m sprint.
</P>
<P>
There are also heats in the women's 400m, as well as semi-finals
in the women's 800m and men's 400m hurdles.
