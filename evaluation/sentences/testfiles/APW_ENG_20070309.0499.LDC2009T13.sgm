The Oscar-nominated Canadian film "Water" opened in India on
Friday, seven years after angry Hindu nationalists disrupted
filming of the movie, which they said made Hindus look bad.
</P>
<P>
Theater owners in Mumbai, India's entertainment capital, said the
first showings of the movie were fully booked and they did not
forsee any trouble.
</P>
<P>
"We are booked for the next few days," said a Manoj Patil, a
manager at Premiere, a popular Mumbai cinema hall. "We have not
made any special security arrangements."
</P>

Hindu nationalists stormed the sets of Water in 2000 when
director Deepa Mehta, who lives in Toronto, was filming in
Varanasi, Hinduism's holiest city. The production did not get
back on track until she resumed shooting four years later in Sri
Lanka.

Traditional Hindus consider widows to be bad luck, and the movie,
set in India of the 1930s, centers on a home where widows are
sent by their families to live among each other, isolated from
their families and the larger society.
</P>
<P>
The movie features actors John Abraham, Seema Biswas and Lisa Ray
and was nominated this year for an Academy Award in the foreign
language film category.
</P>
<P>
It was first screened in 2005 at the Toronto Film Festival and
opened in the United States in April 2006.
