As US gasoline prices hit record peaks, consumers voice concern
</HEADLINE>

<P>
US gasoline prices continued to hit fresh record highs Monday as
millions of Americans prepare to take to the nation's roads en
route to summer vacation hotspots.
</P>
<P>
The American Automobile Association (AAA) said Monday that the
average national price of unleaded regular gasoline (petrol) had
jumped to 3.196 dollars per gallon (3.78 liters), the highest
average it has recorded.
</P>
<P>
A month ago the price was 2.859 dollars a gallon.
</P>
<P>
The price spikes have sparked concern among consumers, and from
groups like the Consumer Federation of America (CFA).
</P>
<P>
Stephen Brobeck, the CFA's executive director, said American
consumers are "clearly feeling the pinch of rising gasoline
prices since average household expenditures on gasoline have
increased 1,000 dollars over the past five years."
</P>
<P>
Although some fuel-conscious consumers are switching to more
fuel-efficient vehicles, such as Toyota's hybrid Prius car or
Ford's Escape hybrid sports utility vehicle (SUV), many Americans
still drive large gas-guzzling SUVs.
</P>
<P>
AAA officials blame some of the price spikes on refinery
maintenance by energy companies. Refiners say they are now
bringing their plants back on line following seasaonal
maintenance.
</P>
<P>
The CFA said in a recent survey it commissioned, 80 percent of
respondents backed improved fuel-efficiency standards for
vehicles. The US Congress is currently mulling improved fuel-
efficiency standards.
</P>
<P>
The consumers' group also issued some recommendations for
Americans planning a summer break by car or SUV. The so-called
"summer driving season" officially starts this weekend.
</P>
<P>
The group advised Americans to tune up their vehicles, make sure
car tires are properly inflated and even to consider losing
weight among a list of key tips aimed at improving vehicle
efficiency.
</P>
<P>
The recent spike in gasoline prices has shattered the previous
national benchmark of 3.06 dollars per gallon on September 5,
2005, in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina when much of the Gulf
Coast's energy production was knocked off line.
