Racing: Raven's Pass triumph caps Classic European Breeders' Cup
showing
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
British raider Raven's Pass blew past heralded Curlin to win the
five million- dollar Breeders' Cup Classic on Saturday and cap a
stellar showing for Europe in the 25.5 million-dollar weekend.
</P>
<P>
Curlin, the only North American horse to surpass 10 million
dollars in earnings, was the overwhelming favorite to polish his
legend by repeating his triumph of 2007.
</P>
<P>
Bettors at Santa Anita placed more than one million dollars on
Curlin to win the Classic.
</P>
<P>
His bid drew a crowd of 51,331 that included California Governor
and onetime movie strongman Arnold Schwarzeneger, actor Kurt
Russell and Joe Torre, former manager of baseball's storied New
York Yankees now at the helm of the Los Angeles Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
But it was Raven's Pass, ridden by Frankie Dettori for trainer
John Gosden, who pelted to victory on the final straight as
Curlin faded to a stunning fourth in the 1 1/4-mile race on Santa
Anita's Pro-Ride synthetic track.
</P>
<P>
Henrythenavigator, trained by Irishman Aidan O'Brien and ridden
by John Velazquez, was second, 1 3/4 lengths behind.
</P>
<P>
Tiago, trained by John Shirreffs and ridden by Mike Smith, was
third.
</P>
<P>
"Brilliant! A dream come true!" said jubliant Dettori, who flung
his whip into the air in celebration.
</P>
<P>
It was a perfect homecoming for Gosden, who trained here from
1979-1988.
</P>
<P>
"What a day to cherish," he said. "Sometimes, things just go
right."
</P>
<P>
Gosden admitted that beating a horse of Curlin's caliber made the
Classic victory even sweeter.
</P>
<P>
"Curlin set the standard. Curlin set the benchmark," Gosden said.
"He's a magnificent horse, and the way he won in the slop last
year was superb.
</P>
<P>
"In Dubai (the 2008 Dubai World Cup), he was fantastic. He's a
great horse, and he's still a great horse.
</P>
<P>
"But it's like any champion. When you fight, you put the belts
down on the ground. There's always a chance the challenger can
come on and catch you with the left hook."
</P>
<P>
The triumph of Raven's Pass punctuated a stellar day for
European-based horses, which won five of Saturday's nine races
after being shut out in the five races for fillies and mares on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
It was the second triumph of the day for Gosden and Dettori, who
combined to take Donativum to victory in the one million-dollar,
one-mile Juvenile Turf.
</P>
<P>
While Europe celebrated a perfect ending to an exceptional day,
Curlin's connections were left to wonder if the synthetic surface
scuppered their super horse.
</P>
<P>
For trainer Steve Asmussen, there was no doubt.
</P>
<P>
"It was a turf race," Asmussen said. "It absolutely was the Pro-
Ride surface. He ran his heart out and gave it all he had. He's a
great horse."
</P>
<P>
It was no surprise to see a European in control in the three-
million-dollar, 1 1/2-mile Turf.
</P>
<P>
Irish-bred Conduit gave Barbados-born trainer Sir Michael Stoute
his third Turf victory.
</P>
<P>
"I was very confident running him on the course here because he’s
raced well on firm turf before," Stoute said. "I was not worried
about the heat today because he’s a young horse and quite fit."
</P>
<P>
Filly Goldikova won the two million-dollar Mile on the turf
course, giving her French trainer Freddie Head a unique Breeders'
Cup double.
</P>
<P>
Head, who rode Miesque to victory in the Mile in 1987 and 1988,
became the first Breeders' Cup winning jockey to win a Breeders'
Cup race as a trainer.
</P>
<P>
Ireland's Muhannak got the ball rolling for the trans-Atlantic
contenders in the first race of the day, the newly introduced 1
1/2-mile Marathon on dirt.
</P>
<P>
Jockey Garrett Gomez piloted an impressive three mounts to the
winner's circle, taking his tally for this 25th edition of the
Breeders' Cup to four.
</P>
<P>
Gomez guided the Bob Baffert-trained Midnight Lute to a second-
straight victory in the two million-dollar, six-furlong Sprint.
</P>
<P>
Gomez and Baffert teamed earlier to take Midshipman to victory in
the two million-dollar, 1 1/16-mile Juvenile for two-year-olds.
</P>
<P>
And Gomez rode Albertus Maximus to a win in the Dirt Mile for
trainer Vladimir Cerin.
</P>
<P>
Richard Migliore, who has won more than 4,000 races in his riding
career, nabbed his first Breeders' Cup victory aboard 36-1 long
shot Desert Code in the one million-dollar 6 1/2-furlong Turf
Sprint.
</P>
<P>
Gosden was full of praise for the new-look Breeders' Cup - even
before his Classic triumph.
</P>
<P>
Fantastic filly Zenyatta dazzled on the first day, overpowering
the field in the two million-dollar Ladies' Classic that
highlighted the five-race programme for fillies and mares.
</P>
<P>
"You can bring any horse here, any distance, colts, fillies,
older or younger, they've opened it up and made a huge effort,"
he said. "It had become slightly static. It was in danger of
becoming a little stale, and they really rejuvenated it."
