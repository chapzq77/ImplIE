Austria saw a roughly 41 percent decline in asylum applications
in 2006, the government said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Applications for asylum decreased from 22,461 in 2005 to 13,347
in 2006, a decline of 40.6 percent, the Austria Press Agency
reported, citing figures provided by the Interior Ministry.
</P>
<P>
A ministry spokeswoman confirmed the APA report and said that
while no specific country-by-country breakdown was available as
yet, the largest declines came from the Russian Federation and
the former Serbia-Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
The number of people who were deported, prevented from entering
Austria illegally, or told to leave the country on their own
accord increased by 14.6 percent in 2006, to 45,869.
</P>
<P>
The ministry spokeswoman attributed both results to an Austrian
law applying to foreigners that took effect a year ago, saying it
sought to separate asylum from immigration and also imposed
stricter penalties on human traffickers.
