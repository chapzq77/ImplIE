In design victory, Intel will partner with Sun Microsystems on
server chips, source says

SAN FRANCISCO 2007-01-22 14:53:32 UTC
</P>
<P>
Server and software maker Sun Microsystems Inc. has agreed to use
chips from Intel Corp. in some of its servers and for Intel to
endorse Sun's Solaris operating system, a person close to the
deal told the AP.
</P>
<P>
An announcement is expected Monday, according to the person, who
requested anonymity because the deal had not been made public.
Specifics of the arrangement were not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
The companies scheduled a joint news conference with Intel Chief
Executive Officer Paul Otellini and Sun CEO Jonathan Schwartz for
Monday morning in San Francisco to announce the alliance.
</P>
<P>
Intel's stock was trading up 10 cents at $20.92, and Sun shares
rose 3 cents to $5.74, both in morning trading on the Nasdaq
Stock Market.
</P>
<P>
The deal marks a major design win for Intel, the world's largest
computer chip maker, which has been fighting to reverse plunging
profits and regain market share lost to archrival Advanced Micro
Devices Inc.
</P>
<P>
It is also a sizable victory for Sun as the company continues its
long climb back to profitability following the dot-com collapse
and seeks more mainstream adoption of its servers and software
products.
</P>
<P>
Shawn Dainas, spokesman for Sun Microsystems, declined to
comment. Intel spokesman Tom Beermann also declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
The partnership comes amid an intensifying fight for market share
between Intel and AMD.
</P>
<P>
Both companies have been slashing prices and incurring heavy
expenses to transition to a more advanced manufacturing
technology that will allow them to shrink the size of the
circuitry on their chips.
</P>
<P>
They have also been waging an inch-by-inch battle for market
share that has been particularly painful for Intel, whose
previous generations of chips began falling out of favor for
their high energy consumption.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Intel lost more than 5 percent of the overall computer
chip market to AMD, according to Mercury Research. Longtime Intel
loyalist Dell Inc. said it would also begin using AMD chips in
its PCs and servers.
</P>
<P>
Some of AMD's most dramatic market-share gains have come in the
high-margin server and laptop markets, areas where Intel
traditionally had little competition.
</P>
<P>
However, Intel, which still commands about three quarters of the
overall chip market, fired back at AMD last year by unveiling a
new line of chips based on an upgraded design that industry
observers cheered for delivering higher performance while giving
off less heat.
</P>
<P>
The competitive pressure appears to be taking its toll on AMD,
which is scheduled to report fourth-quarter earnings on Tuesday
and has warned investors that plunging processor prices would
"substantially" reduce operating income for the quarter.
</P>
<P>
AMD's focus on energy-efficiency helped the company lure away
clients like Sun while Intel was still overhauling its product
line.
</P>
<P>
AMD and Sun entered into a partnership in 2003, and in recent
years Sun has relied exclusively on AMD to supply server chips
based on the popular x86 microarchitecture, or design, used in
many personal computers and servers.
</P>
<P>
Intel was also providing processors for Sun's x86 server line at
the time, but was pushed aside out of concerns about the chips'
power consumption.
</P>
<P>
Under the current deal, Intel will again provide chips for Sun's
x86 line, though this time its Xeon processors are more powerful
and boast dramatically improved energy-saving features.
</P>
<P>
Sun, which also makes its own line of Sparc branded processors,
will still use AMD chips in some of its products, the person
close to the deal said.
</P>
<P>
Sun, which is scheduled to report second-quarter earnings on
Tuesday, is still clawing its way back to profitability after its
gutting during the dot-com fallout.
</P>
<P>
The Santa Clara-based company has lost more than $5 billion
(euro3.9 billion) since 2002, after tech-related spending dried
up and demand plummeted for high-priced servers like Sun's that
were snapped up during the boom but fell idle after the dot-com
bust.
</P>
<P>
Intel's endorsement of the company's Solaris operating system is
also an important victory for Sun, as many servers that use chips
based on the x86 design often run on Linux or Microsoft Corp.'s
Windows operating system.
</P>
<P>
Rumors of a Sun-Intel partnership had circulated since Friday,
when Banc of America Securities analyst Sumit Dhanda wrote in a
research note that Sun was considering using Intel's Xeon
processors for its fast-growing x86-based server product lines.
</P>
<P>
Though Sun is a "fairly small player" in the market for x86-based
servers, coming in sixth in terms of market share, Dhanda said,
the company's sales in that market are growing rapidly.
</P>
<P>
Dhanda said such a partnership could allow Intel to gain as much
as 50 percent of Sun's x86 business, which could translate into
$25 million (euro19.3 million) to $50 million (euro38.6 million)
in lost revenues for AMD.
</P>
<P>
"(W)hile the impact to Intel financials is not meaningful in the
near-term, we think the shift away from AMD bodes well for
momentum in Intel's server business over the course of the
upcoming quarters," Dhanda said in the note.
