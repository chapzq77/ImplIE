BAGHDAD, Iraq -- An Iraqi official announced on Wednesday the
arrest of a witness to Saddam Hussein's hanging who allegedly
recorded the event on a cell phone camera, while an adviser to
the prime minister said two guards present were in custody.
</P>
<P>
A U.S. military spokesman, meanwhile, said the tumultuous
execution would have gone differently had the Americans been in
charge.
</P>
<P>
Maj. Gen. William B. Caldwell also said that Saddam had been
dignified and courteous to his American jailers to the moment
when he was handed over to the Iraqis outside the execution
chamber. The spokesman said no Americans were present for the
hanging.
</P>
<P>
The leaked and unauthorized cell phone video, in which some of
those present can be heard to taunt Saddam in the final moments
of his life, set off an uproar both inside and outside Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The storm of criticism prompted the U.S. to publicly distance
itself and Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki to launch the
investigation that led to Wednesday's detentions.
</P>
<P>
"In the past few hours, the government has arrested the person
who videotaped Saddam's execution. He was an official who
supervised the execution and now he is under investigation," said
a key al-Maliki adviser, who spoke on condition of anonymity
because he was not authorized to release the information.
</P>
<P>
Sami al-Askeri, a Shiite lawmaker who also advises al-Maliki,
said two "Justice Ministry guards were being questioned. The
investigation committee is interrogating the men. If it is found
that any official was involved he will face legal measures."
</P>
<P>
Joining Caldwell in his criticism of the hanging, State
Department spokesman Sean McCormack said U.S. officials had
questioned conducting the execution on a Muslim festival day and
as well as some procedures.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Embassy spokesman Lou Fintor said Ambassador Zalmay
Khalilzad and his diplomatic team "did engage the government of
Iraq on issues relating to procedures involved in the timing of
the execution (of Saddam), given the upcoming holy days. While
the government of Iraq gave consideration to U.S. concerns, all
decisions made regarding the execution were Iraqi decisions based
on their own considerations."
</P>
<P>
Also Wednesday, Iraqi and Arab media and a government official
said preparations were under way to hang two of Saddam Hussein's
co-defendants in the next few days, but the details still have to
be worked out with the American military.
</P>
<P>
A Cabinet official, speaking anonymously because of the
sensitivity of the information, said the two men would hang "at
the beginning of next week."
</P>
<P>
Caldwell said those executions, like Saddam's, were the
responsibility of the Iraqi government. "It's a sovereign nation.
It's their system. They make those decisions."
</P>
<P>
Saddam's half brother Barzan Ibrahim, a former intelligence
chief, and Awad Hamed al-Bandar, the former chief justice of the
Revolutionary Court, were originally scheduled to hang with
Saddam. But their execution was delayed until after Islam's Eid
al-Adha holiday, which ended Wednesday for Iraq's majority
Shiites.
</P>
<P>
In Washington, a lawyer for Bandar asked Supreme Court Chief
Justice John Roberts to block the U.S. military from transferring
custody of the condemned man to Iraqi authorities. U.S. courts
have so far declined to intervene.
</P>
<P>
U.N.'s human rights chief Louise Arbour appealed to Iraqi
President Jalal Talabani to prevent the execution of Ibrahim and
al-Bandar, saying she was concerned with "the fairness and
impartiality" of their trials.
</P>
<P>
As the hanging video swirled, Mowaffak al-Rubaie, the Iraqi
national security adviser and a close ally of al-Maliki, hotly
denied that he was involved in taking video of the execution. He
spoke to CNN after the announcement of the arrest of the unnamed
official in connection with the case.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times reported Wednesday, citing a prosecutor in the
Saddam trial present at the execution, that al-Rubaie had
recorded the execution with a cell phone.
</P>
<P>
Al-Rubaie said neither he nor any other Iraqi official had shot
and leaked the video to Al-Jazeera television and Web sites.
Instead, he suggested Sunni insurgents infiltrated the guard
force and took the pictures.
</P>
<P>
According to the Times, Munqith al-Faroon, the prosecutor, told
the newspaper "one of two men he had seen holding a cell phone
camera aloft to make a video of Mr. Hussein's last moments up to
and past the point where he fell through the trapdoor was
Mowaffak al-Rubaie, Mr. Maliki's national security adviser."
</P>
<P>
But Al-Faroon, in an interview with The Associated Press, denied
the report. "I am not accusing Mowaffak al-Rubaie, and I did not
see him taking pictures," he said.
</P>
<P>
"But I saw two of the government officials who were...present
during the execution taking all the video of the execution, using
the lights that were there for the official taping of the
execution," he added in a phone interview. "They used mobile
phone cameras. I do not know their names, but I would remember
their faces."
</P>
<P>
On its Web site, the Times later noted denials by al-Rubaie and
al-Faroon.
</P>
<P>
As the storm over the handling of the execution gained strength,
Caldwell was among several U.S. officials who suggested
displeasure with the conduct of the execution.
</P>
<P>
"If you are asking me: 'Would we have done things differently?'
Yes, we would have. But that's not our decision. That's the
government of Iraq's decision," Caldwell said.
</P>
<P>
Saddam, Ibrahim and al-Bandar were sentenced to death for the
1982 killings of 148 Shiite Muslims in the town of Dujail, north
of Baghdad, after a failed assassination plot against Saddam.
They were convicted on Nov. 5, and the verdict was upheld by an
appeals court on Dec. 26.
</P>
<P>
Saddam was hanged in Baghdad's Shiite neighborhood of Kazamiyah.
During his regime, Saddam had numerous dissidents and opponents
executed in the facility, located in a neighborhood that is home
to the Iraqi capital's most important Shiite shrine -- the Imam
Kazim shrine.
</P>
<P>
As he faced his own death on the gallows, Caldwell said, Saddam
"was courteous, as he always had been, to his U.S. military
police guards."
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said Saddam's demeanor changed "at the prison
facility when the Iraqi guards were assuming control of him, but
he was still dignified toward us.
</P>
<P>
"He spoke very well to our military police, as he always had. And
when getting off there at the prison site, he said farewell to
his interpreter.
</P>
<P>
"He thanked the military police squad, the lieutenant, the squad
leader, the medical doctor we had present, and the colonel that
was on site."
