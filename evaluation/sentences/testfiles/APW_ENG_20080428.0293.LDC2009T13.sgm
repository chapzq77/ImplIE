COLOMBO, Sri Lanka 2008-04-28 06:44:54 UTC

Police found and defused a makeshift time bomb Monday that was
set to go off at a bus station in central Sri Lanka during the
crowded morning rush hour, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
A commuter noticed the suspicious package at about 6 a.m. at a
bus station in Galgamuwa, some 100 kilometers (60 miles) north of
the capital, Colombo, a military official said on condition of
anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the media.

<P>
Inside the parcel, police discovered an 81 mm mortar shell
converted into a bomb set to detonate about 7:40 a.m., the
official said. A bomb disposal unit defused the device, he said.

Sri Lankan officials have asked the public to become more
vigilant in the wake of recent bombings blamed on Tamil Tiger
rebels. The latest bombing killed 26 people at a bus station in a
Colombo suburb during the busy rush-hour commute Friday
afternoon.

<P>
President Mahinda Rajapaksa said that attack showed the rebels
were lashing out at civilians because they were facing growing
pressure from a military offensive against their de facto state
in the north.
</P>
<P>
In fresh fighting along the front lines in the north Sunday,
troops killed 19 rebels, while one soldier was killed, the
military said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Rebel spokesman Rasiah Ilanthirayan could not be reached for
comment. Both sides routinely exaggerate enemy casualties while
underreporting their own.
</P>
<P>
The government suffered several setbacks in the fighting in
recent days. A battle Wednesday in the Jaffna peninsula killed
scores of soldiers, and the rebels' tiny air wing managed to drop
bombs near Sri Lankan troops Sunday and get away unscathed. The
rebels' continued ability to launch their light aircraft is an
embarrassment to the military, which despite its jets and anti-
aircraft guns, have not been able to shoot them down.
</P>
<P>
The rebels have fought since 1983 to create an independent
homeland for minority ethnic Tamils, who have been marginalized
by successive governments controlled by Sri Lanka's Sinhalese
majority. More than 70,000 people have been killed in the
violence.
