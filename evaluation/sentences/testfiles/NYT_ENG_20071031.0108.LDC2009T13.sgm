AT &amp;amp;amp; T ADDS NAPSTER DOWNLOAD OPTION

SAN ANTONIO
</P>
<P>
AT&amp;amp;T Inc. will make Napster Inc.'s entire catalog of more
than 5 million songs available in November for its subscribers to
download to their handsets.
</P>
<P>
The service boosts San Antonio-based AT&amp;amp;T's over-the-air
download offerings and makes the nation's largest phone company
more competitive with rivals Verizon Wireless and Sprint Nextel,
which have led it in providing wireless music downloads.
</P>
<P>
Under an earlier deal, AT&amp;amp;T let Napster subscribers
transfer music from their personal computers to their cell phones
with a cable or a storage card.
</P>
<P>
The new agreement lets customers download songs directly to their
phones at a cost of $7.49 for a bundle of five or $1.99 for each
individual tune.
</P>
<P>
"We are pleased to expand our relationship with Napster, an
innovator in the digital music revolution, to connect our
customers to more of the music they want in the moment that they
want it," said Mark Collins, vice president of Consumer Data for
AT&amp;amp;T's wireless unit. Wireless companies are pushing new
services such as music downloads, games and Web surfing to boost
their revenues. As cellular phones reach a saturation point, they
no longer can rely on just signing up new voice customers to
drive sales, experts said.
</P>
<P>
AT&amp;amp;T hasn't said which wireless devices will work with
the Napster download service, but it won't work with Apple's
iPhone, for which it is the exclusive carrier. The iPhone handles
only Apple's iTunes music files.
</P>
<P>
Verizon and Sprint -- which beat AT&amp;amp;T to the wireless
music download market -- handle a combined 60 million song
downloads a month, estimates Roger Entner, senior vice president
for IAG Research's communications sector.
</P>
<P>
He said the market for mobile music downloads is still in its
infancy, and it may be the middle of next year before it makes a
significant contribution to wireless carriers' revenues.
</P>
<P>
"It's still a very nascent market, and it's still relatively
small," Entner said. "AT&amp;amp;T let Verizon and Sprint develop
the market and evangelize it to consumers before they decided to
also move into it."
</P>
<P>
While the AT&amp;amp;T-Napster pricing is on par with Verizon's
download charge, it's higher than that of Apple's iTunes and
Sprint Nextel. Both iTunes and Sprint Nextel sell songs for 99
cents.
</P>
<P>
However, Entner said he doubts the higher price will stymie
subscriber use of the Napster service.
</P>
<P>
"When people are on the go and they want the song now, they'll
pay a little extra for it," he said.
