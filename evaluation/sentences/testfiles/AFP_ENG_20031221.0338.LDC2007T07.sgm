Gulf Arab summit opens with call to "combat terror" by Omar Hasan
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gulf Arab leaders opened their annual summit here Sunday with a call
by Kuwait's premier to fight terror, and welcoming the capture of
former Iraqi president Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmad al-Sabah, who opened the summit on behalf of the
ailing Emir Sheikh Jaber al-Ahmad al-Sabah, also said that trying the
former Iraqi strongman would consolidate security and stability in
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The summit is the first to be held by the Gulf alliance since last
April's US-led overthrow of Saddam, who was captured by US forces a
week ago.
</P>
<P>
"Terrorism has expanded and spread to most parts of the world and to
some of our states. This requires that we close ranks and step up
regional and international efforts to confront and combat terror,"
Sheikh Sabah said.
</P>
<P>
Fighting against terrorism, especially after deadly suicide bombings
in Saudi Arabia and shootings in Kuwait, and developments in Iraq
after the US-led overthrow of Saddam, top the agenda of the two-day
meeting.
</P>
<P>
The leaders of the six Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) member states
are expected to approve a joint agreement on combating terror.
</P>
<P>
The GCC comprises the gas- and oil-rich states of Bahrain, Kuwait,
Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE).
</P>
<P>
The five-minute opening session was marked by the absence of Kuwait's
emir who earlier in the day was at the airport to receive all
delegates.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Sabah said developments in Iraq will have a far-reaching and
direct impact on the Gulf states, "which should closely monitor these
events" and prepare for all eventualities.
</P>
<P>
"While following the developments and changes in Iraq very closely, we
hope it will be a prelude for a new phase that lays the foundations
for a new political era in which the Iraqi people rebuild their
country," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Kuwaiti premier also blasted the Israeli "oppressive measures"
against the Palestinian people, saying they "constitute a threat to
the security and stability of the whole area," and abort efforts for a
just peace.
</P>
<P>
The summit is being held amid heightened security with hundreds of
tanks and armoured vehicles and thousands of soldiers deployed to
guard the conference venue of Bayan Palace, south of Kuwait City, and
surrounding areas.
</P>
<P>
Former GCC secretary general Abdullah Bishara has urged the leaders to
upgrade their internal security, cut dependence on the United States
and establish normal ties with Iraq and Iran.
</P>
<P>
Two Kuwaiti Islamist groups, the Islamic Constitutional Movement and
the Salaf Movement, in separate statements Sunday, called on the
leaders to reject US military bases in the region and to embrace
fundamental political reforms.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait's Al-Taleea weekly, mouthpiece of the liberal Kuwait Democratic
Forum, said the GCC "must either live up to the peoples' aspirations
or sign its death certificate."
</P>
<P>
A charter for educational reforms aimed at "reformulating school
curricula" in member states and preventing youths from being
influenced by extremist ideologies is expected to be approved.
</P>
<P>
Economic issues will be high on the agenda with the leaders expected
to review progress made toward monetary union, a single currency and a
common market amid wide criticism of slow-paced implementation.
</P>
<P>
The leaders will examine obstacles facing the customs union which was
launched on January 1.
</P>
<P>
They will also study a number of major projects like a railway linking
GCC states in the first phase and later with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Only two heads of state, Bahrain's King Hamad and Qatari Emir Sheikh
Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani, are attending.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia's ailing King Fahd is represented by Crown Prince and de
facto ruler Abdullah bin Abdul Aziz.
</P>
<P>
UAE President Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan al-Nahayan has stayed away for
health reasons, while Oman's Sultan Qaboos is not attending for
"personal reasons."
