France's Societe Generale announces 6.9 billion euro losses
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
French banking giant Societe Generale reported Thursday losses of
almost seven billion euros (over 10 billion dollars) blamed on
brokerage fraud and the sub- prime mortgage crisis in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
In spite of this massive fall, a statement from the bank showed a
net profit in 2007 of between 600 and 800 million euros, a
miserly return compared to profits of more than 5.2 billion the
year before.
</P>
<P>
Societe General said it would raise 5.5 billion euros of capital
in the coming weeks and announced a press conference later in the
day at its Paris headquarters.
