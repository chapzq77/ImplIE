Police on Thursday found a second weapons cache in northern Spain
linked to nine suspected members of the Basque separatist group
ETA arrested this week, Spanish media reported.
</P>
<P>
A judicial source told AFP that Spain's top anti-terror judge
Baltazar Garzon was in the town of Santo Domingo de la Calzada in
the northern province of La Rioja where Spanish media reported
the weapons cache was found.
</P>
<P>
Public radio RNE said the weapons cache was being inspected by
Garzon and it could contain about 100 kilograms (220 pounds) of
explosives.

Police late on Wednesday found a weapons cache in the nearby ski
resort of Valdezcaray which contained an automatic rifle, tools
to steal cars and a box of tranquillisers linked to the ETA
"Vizcaya" cell which was dismantled a day earlier.
</P>
<P>
Garzon was accompanied by Arkaitz Goikoetxea, the suspected
leader of the cell which the Spanish government blames on most
attacks carried out by ETA since the outfit called off its
ceasefire in June 2007, RNE said.
</P>
<P>
The interior ministry said the cell had been dismantled with
Tuesday's arrest of Goikoetxea and eight other suspected members
of the unit.
</P>
<P>
ETA is blamed for the deaths of 823 people in its 40-year
campaign of bombings and shootings to carve a Basque homeland out
of northern Spain and southwestern France.
