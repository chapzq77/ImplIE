<P>
Tottenham manager Harry Redknapp has confirmed that he could be
interested in signing some of the players he took to Portsmouth
before switching clubs at the weekend.
</P>
<P>
Redknapp quit Pompey for Spurs late Saturday night and said
Tuesday that he could hire some of his former acquisitions when
the next transfer window opens on Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
Those players could include midfielder Lassana Diarra, striker
Peter Crouch and England forward Jermain Defoe, who left
Tottenham for Portsmouth nine months ago and had his name chanted
by Spurs fans in Redknapp's first game in charge.
</P>
<P>
"If Portsmouth want to sell some of their players, there's an
open market," Redknapp said in an interview with BBC Radio 5.
"They've got some fantastic players there. Absolutely top, top
players, they really have."
</P>
<P>
Spurs are still bottom of the Premier League despite Sunday's 2-0
win over Bolton, a predicament largely due to a failure to score
goals and a lack of tenacity in midfield.
</P>
<P>
Defoe left Tottenham because he was an irregular pick behind
Dimitar Berbatov and Robbie Keane, but his rivals have since left
the club and Defoe has hit 14 goals in 21 Premier League matches
for Portsmouth.
</P>
<P>
Defoe is one of six former Tottenham players at Portsmouth,
including Crouch, Sol Campbell and Sean Davis.
</P>
<P>
Redknapp, though, said he would not use his relationship with the
players as leverage or approach contracted players without
permission.
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't go back and start doing that," Redknapp said.
</P>
<P>
Only players who were up for sale by a club would be considered,
he added.
