LOS ANGELES, June 19 (Xinhua)
</P>
<P>
Despite severe delays and flight cancellations caused by weather
and computer malfunctions in the past year, JetBlue remained the
top-ranked U.S. low-cost airline carrier, a major market research
firm said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Continental ranked highest in the regular-priced air travel
market in North America, according to the Los Angles-based J.D.
Power and Associates.
</P>
<P>
The firm's 2007 North America Airline Satisfaction Study measured
the overall customer satisfaction based on performance in seven
measures, including cost and fees, flight crew, in-flight
services, aircraft, boarding/deplaning/baggage, check-in and
reservation.
</P>
<P>
JetBlue Airways ranked highest overall for the third consecutive
year, earning the highest ranking for low-cost carriers --
defined as airlines that operate single-cabin aircraft with
typically low fares -- in 2006 and 2007.
</P>
<P>
The New York-based airline also earned particularly high ratings
in the low-cost carrier segment across all seven customer
satisfaction measures -- despite a double-digit segment decline
in overall satisfaction since 2006.
</P>
<P>
JetBlue achieved an overall satisfaction index score of 810 of a
possible 1,000 points, followed in the rankings by Frontier
Airlines (750), Southwest Airlines (744) and AirTran Airways
(721).
</P>
<P>
"JetBlue continues to lead in satisfaction with low-cost carriers
by a significant margin," said Linda Hirneise, executive director
of the travel practice at J.D. Power and Associates.
</P>
<P>
"Although the airline fell prey to severe weather delays in
February 2007, they have been able to retain feelings of goodwill
among their passenger base," she said. "However, other low-cost
carriers are working to close the gap."
</P>
<P>
She noted that Frontier Airlines, for example, increased by two
rank positions and improved "in all seven measures of
satisfaction, including the most important driver of overall
satisfaction -- cost and fees."
</P>
<P>
According to J.D. Power, Continental Airlines, which ranked
highest for a second consecutive year in the traditional network
carrier segment, earned an overall satisfaction index score of
704, and improved in six measures including reservations, check-
in, boarding/deplaning/baggage, aircraft, flight crew, and cost
and fees.
</P>
<P>
Delta Air Lines, American Airlines and Alaska Airlines followed
in the rankings with index scores of 680, 670 and 668,
respectively. Traditional network carriers are defined as
airlines that operate multi-cabin aircraft and use multiple
airport hubs.
</P>
<P>
J.D. Power based its study on responses from nearly 10,000
passengers who flew on a major North American airline between
April 2006 and April 2007.
