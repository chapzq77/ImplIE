US well-placed to rebound from financial crisis: WEF
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The United States is well placed to rebound from the current
financial crisis because of its inherent competitive advantages,
the World Economic Forum said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The WEF, which hosts the annual Davos pow-wow of business and
political leaders, ranked the United States number one in its
annual competitiveness survey despite the financial turmoil which
has seen Wall Street titans humbled and the taxpayer bailing out
banks to the tune of 700 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
"Despite the financial crisis, the United States continues to be
the most competitive economy in the world," the WEF said in its
report.
</P>
<P>
"This is because it is endowed with many structural features that
make its economy extremely productive and place it on a strong
footing to ride out business cycle shifts and economic shocks,"
it said.
</P>
<P>
WEF economist Thierry Geiger said that the country excels in its
"capacity to innovate, the quality of its institutions, the
efficiency of government in relation to expenditure, the
independence of the judiciary, low levels of corruption and the
flexibility of the goods and labour markets."
</P>
<P>
"The United States is well placed to bounce back from the
crisis," Geiger told AFP.
</P>
<P>
"New York will be New York again, the money and the know-how will
still be there. The US is still the future," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, the report did have some harsh words for US economic
policies in recent years.
</P>
<P>
"The United States has built up large macroeconomic imbalances
over recent years, with repeated fiscal deficits leading to
rising and burgeoning levels of public indebtedness," it said.
</P>
<P>
"This indicates that the country is not preparing financially for
its future liabilities and is on the road to making interest
payments that will increasingly restrict its fiscal policy
freedom going into the future," it added.
</P>
<P>
Switzerland was ranked second in the competitiveness table, with
the WEF praising the small Alpine state's "excellent capacity for
innovation" and its "very sophisticated business culture".
</P>
<P>
Nordic countries also fared well with Denmark in third place,
Sweden fourth and Finland sixth, due to their sound macroeconomic
environment and low levels of public debt.
</P>
<P>
Britain fell three places to twelth from ninth due to a weakening
of its financial markets, while France rose two places to
sixteenth and garnered praise from the WEF for its infrastructure
and transport networks.
</P>
<P>
The WEF bases its rankings on a survey of more than 12,000
business leaders in 134 countries.
