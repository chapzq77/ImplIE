Cranberry Salsa
</P>
<P>
\u2009Perfect for: Holiday parties and gatherings
</P>
<P>
\u2009Make and take: Assemble, chill and carry. No cooking is
required.
</P>
<P>
\u2009A new addition: If your family is one of those that insists
on serving the canned cranberry sauce out of a sense of
tradition, then try adding this recipe to the appetizers - and
let the jellied red rings remain. Or you can serve this as a
relish alongside smoked or grilled turkey meat.
</P>
<P>
Tip: In other seasons, if you can't find fresh or frozen
cranberries, soak 2\u02DB cups dried cranberries in the orange
juice. Because dried cranberries are often sweetened, you may
reduce the honey to taste.
