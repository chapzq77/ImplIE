Abdominal pain knocked top-seeded Marion Bartoli out of the
Cincinnati Women's Open during her first-round match against
Jamea Jackson on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Bartoli lost the first set 7-6 (5) and was trailing 2-2 in the
second set when she called for a trainer, who was seen working on
her abdomen as Bartoli lay on her back. Bartoli also raised her
left arm, mimicking her service toss, before deciding to
continue. She and Jackson played to 30-30 in the next game, but
Bartoli continued to hold her stomach between points and decided
to retire from the match.
</P>
<P>
Bartoli is the second seeded player forced to retire from the
tournament. Eighth-seeded Tamira Paszek was forced out of her
first-round match against Petra Cetkovska because of a viral
illness.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, former No. 1 Amelie Mauresmo off some rust and rallied
for a 6-7 (5), 7-6 (6), 6-1 win over a determined Stephanie
Cohen-Aloro.
</P>
<P>
The fifth-seeded Mauresmo, who reached the top ranking in 2004
and 2006 and now was ranked 35th, overcame inconsistency to pull
away from the 116th-ranked Cohen-Aloro in the all-French match.
</P>
<P>
"She served well and took her chances," Mauresmo said. "She gave
me a lot of trouble. When nothing is working like you want it to
and the other player is playing well, you have to just hang in
there."
</P>
<P>
Mauresmo's first appearance in Cincinnati also was her first
match since Wimbledon, where she lost in the third round to
finalist Serena Williams while dealing with an injury to her left
thigh.
</P>
<P>
"The first match in a month-and-a-half is never easy," Mauresmo
said. "It's much different than practice."
</P>
<P>
Earlier, second-seeded Nadia Petrova and sixth-seeded Canadian
Aleksandra Wozniak rode straight-set wins into the second round.
</P>
<P>
Petrova rolled to a 6-3, 6-0 win over fellow Russian Galina
Voskoboeva, and Wozniak cruised past Japan's Aiko Nakamura 6-3,
6-2.
</P>
<P>
Facing Voskoboeva for the first time in her first Cincinnati
appearance, Petrova dropped three straight games in the first set
to fall behind 3-2 before winning the last 10 games.
</P>
<P>
"I had seen her play once or twice, so I had a good idea about
her game," said Petrova, who reached the quarterfinals at
Wimbledon. "I lost a little concentration early in the match, but
I got myself together, and I didn't give her a chance to come
back."
</P>
<P>
Wozniak, who won at Stanford in July, also was facing a new
opponent in her first appearance in Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
"It went pretty quick," the 20-year-old Canadian said. "I knew
she played fast, and I had to play smart and not let her come
back."
</P>
<P>
In other first-round matches, Julia Vakulenko of Ukraine advanced
with a 6-2, 2-6, 6-4 win over Monica Niculescu of Romania, Vania
King of the United States beat Tathiana Garbin of Italy 6-4, 3-6,
7-5, and Yanina Wickmayer of Belgium defeated Vasilisa Bardina of
Russia 7-5, 3-6, 6-3.
