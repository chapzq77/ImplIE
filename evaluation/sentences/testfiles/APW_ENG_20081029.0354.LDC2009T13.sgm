EU to lend Hungary 6.5 billion euros

EU governments promised to lend Hungary 6.5 billion euros ($8.1
billion) as part of a 20 billion euro ($25 billion) international
rescue package to help it weather a financial crisis that has
sharply devalued its currency, officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The EU's 27 finance ministers and the European Commission said in
a statement that they would join with the International Monetary
Fund and the World Bank in helping Hungary.
</P>
<P>
The IMF will give 12.5 billion euros ($15.6 billion) and the
World Bank another 1 billion euros ($1.25 billion), they said.
</P>
<P>
In return for the loan, the EU executive said Hungary had made a
"strong commitment" to prudent budget policies that include
reducing debt and the yearly budget deficit. It did not give
details.
</P>
<P>
French President Nicolas Sarkozy said Tuesday that EU leaders
would likely make a final decision on the loan when they meet for
a special summit Nov. 7.
</P>
<P>
The EU plans to borrow the money on the capital markets and lend
it to Hungary so the loan will not see European governments
directly pledge cash to Budapest.
</P>
<P>
Over the past few weeks, Hungary's currency -- the forint -- has
plunged against the euro and the U.S. dollar while the Budapest
Stock Exchange's benchmark BUX reached its lowest point in four
years.
</P>
<P>
Hungary already carried a large amount of public debt and was
running the highest budget deficit in the European Union even
before the current turmoil which saw banks shy away from lending
and stock prices plummet.
</P>
<P>
Hungarian Prime Minister Ferenc Gyurcsany warned Tuesday the
economy may shrink by 1 percent this year because of the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Volatile exchange rates are a particular problem for Hungarians
because many people took out housing loans and other debts in
foreign currencies, mostly in Swiss francs and euros, which carry
lower interest rates than Hungarian loans.
</P>
<P>
The tumbling value of the forint means regular debt payments have
now become far more expensive for many people.
