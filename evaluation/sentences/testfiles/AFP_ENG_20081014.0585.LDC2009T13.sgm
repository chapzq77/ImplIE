SAfrica's ruling ANC suspends dissident party chiefs
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
South Africa's ruling ANC has suspended the former defence
minister and will haul him before a disciplinary committee, days
after he threatened to form a breakaway party, officials said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Mosiuoa Lekota, who resigned as defence minister in September,
last week threatened to form a new party and accused the African
National Congress (ANC) of abandoning its democratic ideals in
the sacking of former president Thabo Mbeki.
</P>
<P>
The ANC's National Working Committee issued a statement late
Monday saying that Lekota and his former deputy Mluleki George
had been suspended from the party.
</P>
<P>
Party spokesman Jessie Duarte told SA FM radio Tuesday that they
would also be hauled before a disciplinary committee, which could
take further action.
</P>
<P>
"The National Disciplinary Committee of the African National
Congress will call them (to a meeting) and make a decision,"
Duarte said.
</P>
<P>
Party leaders plan to meet Wednesday to discuss the suspension,
the ANC said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"The ANC will take similar action against any other members who
have indicated in words or action their intention to establish a
party in opposition to the ANC," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Lekota and George are supporters of Mbeki, who was forced by the
ANC to resign as the nation's president on September 20, just
months before the end of his term.
</P>
<P>
Lekota last Wednesday threatened to form a new party that could
challenge the ANC in elections next year.
</P>
<P>
Lekota, a former chairman of the party that led the struggle
against apartheid, said that he was yet to be formally informed
of his suspension.
</P>
<P>
"I do not believe it... I want to wait until I get a letter from
the ANC. The constitution of the ANC says that no member can be
punished before you hold a hearing," he said on a local
television.
</P>
<P>
The threat of a breakaway party marks the latest twist in a long-
running power struggle between Mbeki and party boss Jacob Zuma.
</P>
<P>
Zuma unseated Mbeki as party leader last December, in a dramatic
upset for the man who succeeded democracy icon Nelson Mandela as
South Africa's second president since the end of apartheid.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki himself has made no statements about a breakaway group.
