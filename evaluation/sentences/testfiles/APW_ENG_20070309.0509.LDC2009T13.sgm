In new charges, Israeli group says troops used Palestinian
civilians as human shields

The Israeli army said Friday that it was looking into new
allegations that troops used Palestinians as human shields during
an operation in the West Bank city of Nablus.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli human rights group B'Tselem charged that while
conducting a major operation against Palestinian gunmen in the
city last week, troops took two minors -- a 15-year-old boy and
an 11-year old girl -- along while they searched houses for
militants and weapons, forcing them to enter the houses first.
</P>
<P>
The use of civilians in military operations has been ruled
illegal by Israel's Supreme Court and is prohibited by military
orders. The army said Friday that it was checking the new
charges.
</P>
<P>
The first indication that troops used Palestinians as human
shields in the Nablus operation came when an Associated Press
Television camera captured what appeared to be such a scene on
Feb. 25. The footage shows Sameh Amira, 24, accompanying troops
as they enter apartments in the city's casbah, or Old City.
</P>
<P>
The army promised a "thorough inquiry" into that incident.
</P>
<P>
Amira's cousin, 15-year-old Amid Amira, told B'Tselem field
workers that soldiers took him at the same time as they took
Sameh. They forced him to come along as they searched three
houses, he said, making him enter rooms first, empty cupboards
and open windows.

Jihan Dadush, 11, told B'Tselem that soldiers took her from her
home three days later, on Feb. 28, forcing her to open the door
of a neighboring apartment and enter ahead of them. The soldiers
then took her home, she said.
</P>
<P>
Until 2005, soldiers employed a tactic of making civilians knock
on their neighbors' doors to warn them of an impending raid,
claiming this protected bystanders by spurring militants to
surrender peacefully. But in a landmark 2005 ruling, the Israeli
Supreme Court ruled the tactic illegal and barred any use of
civilians in military operations.

<P>
B'Tselem spokeswoman Sarit Michaeli urged the army to open a
military police investigation into the Nablus incidents. "The
army must investigate what happened and act accordingly -- try
people, make sure the rules are clarified and understand where
the failures were, in order to prevent this from happening
again," she said.

<P>
In August 2002, a 19-year-old Palestinian student, Nidal
Daraghmeh, was killed when troops in the West Bank town of Tubas
forced him to knock on the door of a neighboring building where a
Hamas fugitive was hiding. Gunfire erupted and Daraghmeh was
killed.
