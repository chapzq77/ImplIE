<P>
A few hours after meeting a former KGB general outside a spy
museum here, an outspoken critic of the Kremlin became engulfed
in the kind of intrigue he studies when was shot Thursday outside
his suburban Maryland home.
</P>
<P>
The shooting occurred four days after the critic, Paul M. Joyal,
warned on "Dateline NBC," the television news magazine, that a
"message has been communicated to anyone who wants to speak out
against the Kremlin: 'If you do, no matter who you are, where you
are, we will find you and we will silence you in the most
horrible way possible." Joyal was speaking about the poisoning of
Alexander V. Litvinenko, a KGB defector, who was poisoned last
fall in London.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Prince George's County police department
declined to say whether the police viewed the shooting as a
reprisal or a coincidence. The spokesman, Corp. Clinton Copeland,
said the police had "a vague description of two black males"
fleeing the scene.
</P>
<P>
Federal authorities were leaning toward the view that Joyal was
the victim of a street crime unrelated to his opinions of Russia,
said a federal law enforcement official. The official, who spoke
on the condition of anonymity because the investigation is
incomplete, said the crime scene did not point toward
professional assassins.
</P>
<P>
Joyal, 53, who was shot in the groin outside his home in Adelphi,
Md., was in stable condition on Saturday, the police said.
</P>
<P>
Joyal was an aide on the Senate Intelligence Committee from 1980
to 1989 and edited a business newsletter about Russia throughout
the 1990s. He has criticized President Vladimir Putin of Russia
for reversing democratic reforms and was quoted several years.
</P>
<P>
In the mid-1990s, Joyal went into business with Oleg Kalugin, a
former KGB general who became a leading KGB critic and moved to
Washington. The venture failed.
</P>
<P>
They met Thursday afternoon at a restaurant next to the
International Spy Museum in downtown Washington. Soon after Joyal
arrived home at 7:30, Kalugin got a panicked call from Joyal's
wife, Elizabeth, who had found her husband shot in the driveway.
"She called me and said, 'Oleg, Paul is shot, I want to warn
you,"' Kalugin said. "I couldn't believe my ears."
</P>
<P>
Despite Elizabeth Joyal's warning and his dim view of the KGB,
Kalugin said "my suspicion is that it's not linked to anything
international." As described, he said, the crime did not bear the
fingerprints of Russian agents. He also said their enemies' list
had more prominent names on it than that of Joyal.
</P>
<P>
Joyal was featured prominently in the "Dateline NBC" segment
about Litvinenko, who died in November after ingesting a rare
radioactive substance called Polonium 210, the bulk of which
comes from Russia. Litvinenko fled the country after accusing
superiors of ordering him to kill Boris Berezovsky, a wealthy
Russian businessman.
