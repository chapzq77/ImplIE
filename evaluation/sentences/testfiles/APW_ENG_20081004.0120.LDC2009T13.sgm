Beaches once thick with birds quiet thanks to Ike

<P>
One of North America's renowned bird migration and bird watching
areas is strangely silent.
</P>
<P>
Blame Hurricane Ike.
</P>
<P>
"We had red-winged blackbirds, sparrows, a bunch of migrating
birds," recalled Ernest Stone, 75, leaning on his cane and
surveying debris on the cratered moonscape that used to be the
family beach house on Bolivar Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
"I haven't seen a pigeon in a while," he said. "Seagulls. You
could always go out and throw a piece of bread and the seagulls
would come."
</P>
<P>
Not now.
</P>
<P>
"Nothing," his wife, Jimmie, said. "Zero."
</P>
<P>
The same could be said for their home and beachfront community of
Gilchrist, where little is standing three weeks after Ike roared
ashore with 110 mph (177 kph) winds, a 12-foot (3.66-meter) storm
surge and waves up to 26 feet (7.92 meters). The few palm trees
or patches of grass, nearly unrecognizable amid the shells and
dried mud, have turned a lifeless yellow brown, killed by sea
water.
</P>
<P>
For people surrounded by devastation with months of rebuilding
ahead of them, the birds represent yet another piece of normalcy
lost.
</P>
<P>
"Pelicans and seagulls," Veronica Felty, 46, said, looking out
over the gulf waters that wiped out her place. "Birds -- 40 to 50
in a row -- flying. They were endless. They were beautiful ...
You wonder if they knew to leave."
</P>
<P>
Bolivar Peninsula is part of what's known as the Great Texas
Coastal Birding Trail, with nearby High Island a prime bird
watching spot and traditional rest stop for migrating birds
heading north in the spring and south in the fall. The Great
Texas Birding Classic, a bird-watching tournament held every
April during the spring migration, attracts participants from
around the country and world as well.
</P>
<P>
High Island, at 32 feet (9.75 meters) over sea level, is the
highest spot on the gulf coastline for 700 miles (1,126
kilometers) between Mobile Bay, Alabama, and the Rio Grande, and
attracts thousands of bird-watchers a year.
</P>
<P>
"Now is when birds would normally be stopping at High Island to
top off with bugs before heading south," said Ian Tizard,
director of the Schubot Exotic Bird Health Center at Texas
A&amp;M University. "High Island has been stripped of leaves, and
a lot of the trees are dying."
</P>
<P>
While the loss is tough for bird watchers, Tizard said it might
not be so bad for many of the birds: "From a migrating bird's
point of view, it's probably not a big deal to fly a few miles on
until they find a batch of trees that looks better."
</P>
<P>
Tizard said he believes things will get better in the spring.
</P>
<P>
Just like humans, the birds need three basics that Ike took away:
cover, food and water.
</P>
<P>
"There's no fresh water," said Texas Parks &amp; Wildlife
biologist Cliff Shackleford, who said a good rain would ease the
island's woes. "That surge killed everything and dumped salt
water into everything, probably for miles.
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't mean they all died, but we don't really know. The
birds ... need to drink, they need to bathe and salt water just
doesn't do it."
</P>
<P>
Any protection the birds would seek was wiped out when the trees
and most structures were obliterated.
</P>
<P>
"Look at the vegetation," Brent Ortega, one of Shackleford's
colleagues, said. "Either there isn't any, or it's covered with
salt. Plant material is dying, insects and seeds are not there
any more. The habitat's changed and the birds have got to live.
They probably moved somewhere else because it's not very
suitable."
</P>
<P>
Jimmie Stone, 67, looked at a pile of palm trees that used to
border their driveway.
</P>
<P>
"We had three on each side," she said. "We had a huge tree in the
yard. We had a bird feeder..."
</P>
<P>
Instead, chunks of broken concrete -- their former driveway, the
home foundation, the patio -- tip at angles where waves lifted
them and cast them aside. A dead pigeon sat on the side of Texas
Highway 87. A few lonesome pelicans roosted on the remains of a
pier jutting into the Gulf of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, there weren't many places for a bird to roost.
</P>
<P>
"I've got plenty of structure, but it's not mine," Ernest Stone
said matter-of-factly, looking at the rubble of his neighbors'
homes littering his property.
</P>
<P>
His mobile home ended up across the highway. The only
recognizable parts of it are the wheels, upside down and twisted
amid other debris.
