RugbyU: Munster clinch second European Cup title
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Munster won their second European Cup title in three seasons with
a nail-biting 16-13 triumph over Toulouse in the final at the
Millennium Stadium here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Denis Leamy's first half try was supported by 11 points from the
ice-cool Ronan O'Gara as head coach Declan Kidney was handed the
perfect send-off.
</P>
<P>
Kidney masterminded another European crown but he now leaves
Munster to take on the Ireland national team job.
</P>
<P>
Winger Yves Donguy gave Toulouse a lifeline with his second half
score but O'Gara clinched victory with his third penalty with 15
minutes remaining.
</P>
<P>
Toulouse went in search of their fourth European Cup title while
Munster returned to the scene of their 2006 triumph.
</P>
<P>
The Irish province are the only side to have reached the knock-
out stages in the past decade and they showed everyone just why
with a rugged display towards victory.
</P>
<P>
The final pumped 20 million pounds into Cardiff and a large
proportion of that income came from the Irishmen who invaded the
Welsh capital to say a fond farewell to Kidney.
</P>
<P>
Munster had tasted both joy and despair at the Millennium Stadium
on their previous two visits.
</P>
<P>
Kidney's men snatched victory for their first European Cup title
against Biarritz but also suffered heartbreak to Leicester in
2002.
</P>
<P>
And Kidney's last stand came against legendary Toulouse coach Guy
Noves who was present when the French outfit won their first
title in Cardiff back in 1996.
</P>
<P>
But this time he was without joint leading try scorer Vincent
Clerc through injury.
</P>
<P>
Captains Febian Pelous and Paul O'Connell led their sides into a
cauldron of noise at the Millennium Stadium.
</P>
<P>
Toulouse had the first opportunity to open the scoring but Jean-
Baptiste Elissalde pulled his fourth minute penalty attempt wide.
</P>
<P>
However, Elissalde cooly slotted home two minutes later to hand
Toulouse the lead.
</P>
<P>
French centre Yannick Jauzion beat Munster full-back Denis Hurley
to the high ball and Elissalde made no mistake from close-range.
</P>
<P>
It was one-way traffic from Toulouse who continued to pile on the
pressure in the opening quarter but Munster remained just three
points adrift thanks to their committed defence.
</P>
<P>
And in the Irishmen's first attack on the half hour mark, Hurley
was stopped just shy of the try-line following Doug Howlett‘s
mazy run.
</P>
<P>
Munster were gathering momentum and number eight Leamy was denied
by video referee Derek Bevan after he dropped the ball with the
line at his mercy.
</P>
<P>
But after a series of close-range drives, Leamy powered over for
the first try of a compelling encounter.
</P>
<P>
O'Gara extended the lead with the conversion and then a penalty
to nudge Munster seven points clear.
</P>
<P>
Kidney's men were handed a boost when Pelous was yellow-carded
for kneeing Alan Quinlan in the back in the 50th minute.
</P>
<P>
O'Gara kicked another penalty but Toulouse hit back when a moment
of genius from Cedric Heymans brought the three-times champions
back in the contest.
</P>
<P>
Yves Donguy added the finishing touch after Heymans' delightful
chip and chase released Jauzion who beat O'Gara to the chase.
</P>
<P>
Elissalde converted to tie the scores before O‘Gara booted his
third decisive penalty to put Munster back in front with 15
minutes remaining.
