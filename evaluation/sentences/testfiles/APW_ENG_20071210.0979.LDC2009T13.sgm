The euro rose against the U.S. dollar Monday, at the start of a
week that could see the U.S. Federal Reserve cut interest rates
again.
</P>
<P>
The 13-nation euro bought US$1.4708 in afternoon European
trading, up from the US$1.4655 it bought in New York late Friday.
</P>
<P>
The British pound was a little higher, climbing to US$2.0456 from
US$2.0315. The dollar rose to purchase 111.75 Japanese yen from
111.69 yen.

The Fed meets Tuesday to discuss interest rates, with analysts
expecting the U.S. central bank to trim its key rate, now at 4.5
percent, by a quarter of a percentage point. Some have speculated
about the possibility of a half-point cut.
</P>
<P>
The expected cut would be the third in a row, amid mortgage
problems in the U.S. that have tripped up borrowers and caused a
credit crisis among banks -- fueling wider fears about the health
of the U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
Lower interest rates can jump-start an economy, but they can also
weaken a currency as investors transfer funds to countries where
they can earn higher returns.
</P>
<P>
If the U.S. does cut rates, it will follow in the footsteps of
the Bank of England, which last week cut its benchmark rate to
5.5 percent from 5.75 percent and of Canada's central bank, which
cut its rate to 4.25 percent.
</P>
<P>
The European Central Bank kept its rate unchanged at 4 percent
last week but appeared to set the stage for a possible rate
decrease sometime in early 2008.
