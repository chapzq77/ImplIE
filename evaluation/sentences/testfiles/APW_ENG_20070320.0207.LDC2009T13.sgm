Egyptian parliament approves controversial amendments to
constitution

CAIRO, Egypt 2007-03-20 03:41:03 UTC
</P>
<P>
Egypt's parliament approved a controversial set of amendments to
the constitution that the opposition has denounced as a blow to
democracy in this top U.S. ally in the Mideast.
</P>
<P>
President Hosni Mubarak has billed the changes Monday as part of
a reform package aimed at increasing democracy in the country he
has ruled unchallenged for a quarter century.
</P>
<P>
But the opposition has said the changes will restrict judicial
supervision of elections they call vital to preventing vote
fraud. The amendments also write permanently into the
constitution strong security powers for the president they fear
will be abused.
</P>
<P>
The changes come at a time that the U.S. has reduced public
pressure on Egypt to bring greater democracy. Two years ago, the
Bush administration made reform in Egypt a top priority, but more
recently it has spoken out less often, more concerned with
winning Cairo's support in the Mideast's numerous crises,
including Iraq, Lebanon and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
</P>
<P>
Many critics see the changes as aimed at preserving the 78-year-
old Mubarak's control and smoothing the way for his son Gamal to
succeed him in a future election. Opponents also believe the
amendments aim to ward off any election challenge from the Muslim
Brotherhood, an Islamic fundamentalist group and the biggest
opposition bloc in the legislature.
</P>
<P>
The 454-seat parliament voted on the measures in a late evening
session, a day earlier than expected, after hours of discussion.
"With our blood and souls we sacrifice ourselves for you,
Mubarak," the ruling party lawmakers chanted before the results
of the vote were announced.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Muslim Brotherhood accused the government of
passing the measures "in the night, like thieves."
</P>
<P>
"There is a strange and worrisome insistence on passing the
amendments as quickly as possible, which reveals the extent of
the conspiracy against the people," Hamdi Hassan told The
Associated Press."
</P>
<P>
The 34 amendments passed with a vote of 315 in favor, parliament
speaker Fathi Sorour said on Egyptian television. The amendments
will now be put before a popular referendum, expected in late
March or early April.
</P>
<P>
Sorour did not announce the "no" votes in the session. The
Brotherhood's Hassan said 113 lawmakers voted against the
amendments, including two members of the ruling National
Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
Abdel-Halim Qandil, a leader of the pro-reform Kifaya movement,
said the government was "rushing to commit a political crime. ...
They are using the constitution like a tissue paper."
</P>
<P>
"They are moving on to a greater crime, the son inheriting power
from the father," he said.
</P>
<P>
One amendment bans the formation of any political party based on
religion, ensuring the Brotherhood -- which is banned -- cannot
become a party.
</P>
<P>
Another amendment would require any candidate for president to
come from a recognized political party holding at least 3 percent
of the seats in parliament.
</P>
<P>
Brotherhood candidates run as independents in elections. The
group scored a surprise victory in parliamentary elections in
2005, winning about a fifth of the seats.
</P>
<P>
The opposition was also angered by a change that would create an
independent commission to monitor elections, a step they say will
reduce the role of judges in overseeing the vote. During the 2005
elections, pro-reform judges blew the whistle on vote fraud that
plagued the balloting.
</P>
<P>
Another amendment would replace emergency laws in place since the
1981 assassination of President Anwar Sadat, which give police
wide powers to detain people and curb political activity.
</P>
<P>
Under the new proposed amendment, the constitution would empower
the president to refer "any terrorist crime to any of the
judiciary authorities stated in the constitution or the law."
</P>
<P>
Opponents say that means the president can refer suspects to
military courts, which have been widely used in the past but are
sharply criticized by rights groups since their rulings cannot be
appealed.
</P>
<P>
The London-based rights group Amnesty International said the
proposed reforms, particularly the anti-terrorism statute, will
lead to the "greatest erosion of rights in 26 years."
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Ahmed Aboul Gheit bluntly rejected the
criticism, saying outsiders don't have the right to "even express
their opinion" on Egypt's constitution.
