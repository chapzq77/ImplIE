EU agrees plans for deep cuts in greenhouse gas emissions
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
EU environment ministers agreed on Tuesday to plans for deep cuts
in greenhouse gases of as much as 30 percent, the European
Commission said.
</P>
<P>
The ministers, meeting in Brussels, agreed to set a target to
slash carbon dioxide emissions by "at least" 20 percent by 2020
and possibly as much as 30 percent, the latter on condition that
other developed countries are willing to do the same.
</P>
<P>
The commitment would be the main plank of the European Union's
strategy for combatting climate change after 2012, when existing
emissions targets under the Kyoto Protocol expire.
</P>
<P>
Under the Kyoto Protocol, developed countries are currently
supposed to reduce their emissions by five percent by 2012 from
1990 levels, while the EU has a higher target of eight percent.
