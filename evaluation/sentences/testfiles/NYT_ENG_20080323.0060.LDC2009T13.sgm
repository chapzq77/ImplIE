ST. PETERSBURG  RHPs Jason Hammel and Edwin Jackson seemed likely
as much by being out of options as anything else  to retain their
spots in the Rays rotation, at least to start the season.
</P>
<P>
But RHP Andy Sonnanstine had to win his the old-fashioned way,
and as the result of his strong spring (a 0.64 ERA, .163 average
and two walks in 14 innings), and the absence of ace Scott
Kazmir, Sonnanstine was named Saturday as the No.??3 starter
behind James Shields and Matt Garza.
</P>
<P>
The decision was something of a surprise, especially to
Sonnanstine, who wasn't sure of his role as he was used in relief
in four of his six spring outings. "It's been a little stressful
for me this whole spring training just not knowing," he said,
"but maybe that caused me to work a little bit harder."
</P>
<P>
But manager Joe Maddon said it was a matter of wanting to see
other pitchers first, and having a pretty good idea of how well
Sonnanstine, who turned 25 Tuesday, would respond and compete.
</P>
<P>
"I have a lot of confidence in him," Maddon said. "He just has
been a survivor. He's always been the last guy to make teams, and
then he always goes out and performs well. He's got to prove
himself on an annual basis, and he does. And I think because of
that, this guy has built up a certain toughness about him that
maybe some other people lack."
</P>
<P>
The Rays made the rotation official by optioning RHP Jeff Niemann
to Triple A ("He made a great case for himself," Maddon said) and
targeting LHP J.P. Howell for the long-relief role. ("He really
fits the requirements," Maddon said.) They haven't decided
whether Jackson or Hammel will be No. 4.
</P>
<P>
When Kazmir returns  perhaps late April, though no one seems to
know for sure  the Rays will have to drop someone, and Maddon
said the evaluation process will be ongoing and the requirements
to stay higher than in the past.
</P>
<P>
Hammel (0-1, 7.13 ERA; 21 hits, nine walks in 172/3 IP) said,
candidly, he didn't deserve to make the rotation based on his
spring work and was determined to show he was worthy: "It's my
job now to prove the decision right."
</P>
<P>
Jackson (0-1, 5.40 ERA; 13 hits, seven walks in 162/3 IP) said he
welcomed the opportunity and didn't care where he slotted in the
rotation.
</P>
<P>
ON DECK: Niemann was disappointed but felt he made a good enough
impression (going 2-0, 1.50 and heeding the requests to keep the
ball down) that he could get back soon. "Hopefully I made a
strong enough case and strong enough statement when I was out
there that I'm definitely in their heads," he said.
</P>
<P>
EVAN ALMIGHTY: A verdict on whether 3B prospect Evan Longoria
starts in the majors or the minors is expected in the next few
days, and he feels he has stated his case well, hitting .289 with
teams highs in homers (three), RBIs (10) and walks (10), though
he knows there may be more to the decision, such as contractual
implications.
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to be disappointed in whatever decision they
make," Longoria said. "I feel I've done enough, I feel that I
deserve to be here, but it's not always going to be based on the
best guy, or what's been done. It is a business, too, and I
understand that."
</P>
<P>
PRICE CHECK: Top draft pick LHP David Price left a minor-league
exhibition start Thursday after feeling some "discomfort" in his
elbow and will see Dr. Koco Eaton in the next few days, but the
Rays say they don't consider it anything serious.
</P>
<P>
MISCELLANY: Saturday's game was canceled due to rain with the
Pirates leading 2-0 after two innings.  Maddon said Kazmir keeps
"getting better" but remains limited to playing catch, and there
is still no timetable for him to return to the mound.  The staff
met late Saturday, and remaining roster decisions may go to the
end of the week, including a battle for the last relief spot
between RHPs Grant Balfour and Scott Dohmann.  C Hector Gimenez,
who could get a big-league look once his right shoulder is fully
recovered from surgery, was reassigned to minor-league camp.
