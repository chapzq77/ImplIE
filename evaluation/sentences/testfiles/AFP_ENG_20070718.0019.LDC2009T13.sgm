US, other Paris Club creditors to give debt relief to Afghanistan
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The United States and fellow Paris Club members Russia and
Germany agreed Wednesday to provide additional debt relief of
about one billion dollars to Afghanistan, the US Treasury
Department said.
</P>
<P>
The debt relief comes under the terms of the enhanced Heavily
Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative, the Treasury said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
The agreement permits Afghanistan to benefit from debt reduction
under the HIPC initiative of 92 percent, which is worth
approximately one billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Under the HIPC framework, the three creditors will cancel 90
percent of the non- concessional debt payments Afghanistan would
owe during its current IMF program, furthering the relief the
three countries had agreed to provide at a Paris Club meeting in
July 2006.
</P>
<P>
The United States will go beyond the HIPC framework and forgive
100 percent of all debt payments falling due, the Treasury said.
</P>
<P>
The debt relief follows a decision by the executive boards of the
World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, "with strong US
support," to declare earlier in July that Afghanistan had
formally qualified for the HIPC initiative, the Treasury said.
</P>
<P>
"To achieve this, the Afghan government had to adhere to the
terms of its IMF program as well as meet certain other
requirements," it said.
</P>
<P>
All remaining debt will be forgiven by the United States, Russia
and Germany once Afghanistan reaches the completion point of its
HIPC program, bringing total debt relief for Afghanistan to more
than 11 billion dollars, or more than 99 percent of its total
debt, the department said.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting on July 19, 2006, the Paris Club, an informal group
of creditor governments from major industrialized countries,
agreed to write off 1.6 billion dollars of Afghanistan's public
debt and reschedule 800 million dollars.
