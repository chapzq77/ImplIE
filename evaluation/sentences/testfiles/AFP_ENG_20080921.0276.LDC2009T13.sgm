Football: Killie boss Jefferies signs new deal
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Kilmarnock manager Jim Jefferies has agreed a contract extension
which will keep him with the Scottish Premier League club until
May 2012, it was announced Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Kilmarnock, who kept five clean sheets in August, have won three
of their five SPL matches so far this season with just one defeat
before Sunday's match at home to champions Celtic.
</P>
<P>
Also staying at Rugby Park is assistant manager Billy Brown.
</P>
<P>
"It's been a great start to the season and hopefully this is more
good news for the supporters," Killie chairman Michael Johnston
told BBC Radio Scotland.
</P>
<P>
"I'm a great believer in stability. I have never had any doubt
about Jim and Billy's abilities to get the best out of the squad.
</P>
<P>
"They have shown that over the years since they came here in
2002.
</P>
<P>
"We had a bit of a blip last year but that was principally down
to a succession of injuries, keeping out key players at important
times.
</P>
<P>
"We strengthened the squad and we have had a good start, so
everything is back on track."
