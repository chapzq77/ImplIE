Maxi Rodriguez will miss Argentina's upcoming World Cup
qualifiers after injuring his leg while playing for Atletico
Madrid in the Spanish league.
</P>
<P>
Medical scans on Sunday confirmed a muscle injury in the 27-year-
old midfielder's right leg, which would likely keep him out of
action for at least 10 days. Maxi hurt his leg on Saturday after
his long-range goal in the 14th minute in Atletico's 6-1 loss at
FC Barcelona.
</P>
<P>
Atletico was hopeful Maxi will be available for the club's next
match against crosstown rival Real Madrid on Oct. 19.

<P>
Argentina hosts Uruguay next Saturday before traveling to
Santiago to face Chile on Oct. 15. Argentina was tied for second
in South America's 10-team qualifying group with 13 points,
trailing Paraguay by four.
</P>
<P>
The injury was a blow to Maxi, a former regular in Argentina's
squad who has yet to cement himself back in the team since
picking up a severe knee injury while playing a friendly against
Spain in November 2006.
</P>
<P>
He has played 27 matches for Argentina.
