Judge Doubles O.J. Simpson's Bail
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An angry District Judge Jackie Glass set bail at $250,000.
</P>
<P>
Simpson was returned to jail here from his home in Florida last
week after the Clark County district attorney's office said
Simpson had violated the conditions of his bail by attempting to
contact co-defendant Clarence "C.J." Stewart .
</P>
<P>
District Attorney David Roger said Simpson, in a telephone call,
asked his bail bondsman, Miguel Pereira, to tell Stewart how
upset he was about Stewart's testimony during their preliminary
hearing.
</P>
<P>
Glass said she couldn't understand why Simpson had made the
telephone call, but warned him that she would tolerate no such
behavior.
</P>
<P>
"If you violate those rules and anything happens like this in the
future, you'll be back and locked up in the Clark County
Detention Center," she warned Simpson.
</P>
<P>
"I don't know, Mr. Simpson, what the heck you were thinking, or
maybe that's the problem -- you weren't," Glass said.
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if it's just arrogance. I don't know if it's
ignorance. But you've been locked up at the Clark County
Detention Center since Friday because of arrogance or ignorance
or both."
</P>
<P>
Simpson was expected to post the new bond, said his lawyer, Yale
Galanter, though the exact time was unknown.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, a shackled Simpson wearing blue jail togs was brought
into the courtroom to appear before Glass.
</P>
<P>
In September, Simpson, 60, and several others were charged with
entering a hotel room and taking sports memorabilia at gunpoint.
Simpson has denied knowing that guns would be involved and has
insisted he was just recovering items originally stolen from him
by an agent.
</P>
<P>
Simpson  pleaded not guilty Nov. 28 to kidnapping, armed robbery,
assault with a deadly weapon, burglary, coercion and conspiracy
charges in the incident. Three  former co-defendants have pleaded
to lesser charges and testified against Simpson at the
preliminary hearing.
</P>
<P>
The trial is scheduled to begin in April.
</P>
<P>
Justice of the Peace Joe M. Bonaventure, who set the original
bail on Sept. 19, was insistent that Simpson not have any contact
with anyone involved in the case.
</P>
<P>
The prosecutor alleges that Simpson detailed in a Nov. 16
telephone message what he wanted Pereira to tell Stewart: "I just
want, want C.J. to know that ... I'm tired of this (expletive).
Fed up with (expletives) changing what they told me. All right?"
</P>
<P>
Simpson, in court papers, denied violating the original
conditions of the bail.
</P>
<P>
Pereira was the only witness in the proceeding, which lasted less
than 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
Times staff writers Powers reported from Las Vegas and Muskal
from Los Angeles.
