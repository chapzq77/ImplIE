French court paves way for US trial over charter crash
</HEADLINE>

<P>
A French court ruling Thursday paved the way for a possible US
trial over a 2004 charter aircraft crash in Egypt that killed 134
French tourists, focusing on the responsibility of US planemaker
Boeing.
</P>
<P>
The Paris court of appeal ruled in favour of families of the
victims of the crash off the Red Sea resort of Sharm-el-Sheikh,
who argued the civil case fell outside French jurisdiction and
should be tried in the United States.
</P>
<P>
A lower court had rejected the families' arguments in June 2006.
</P>
<P>
"This opens the door for the case to return to the United
States," said Denis Chemla, lawyer for US aeronautics supplier
Honeywell, who said he would study the ruling before deciding
whether to file a higher appeal.
</P>
<P>
Honeywell is one of four US companies targeted by the victims'
attorneys, along with Boeing, IFLC the owner of the plane, and
Parker Hannifin, maker of hydraulic equipment.
</P>
<P>
Separate French and Egyptian probes into the January 2004 crash
of the Boeing 737 aircraft, which killed 148 people including 134
French tourists, failed to establish any responsibility on the
planemaker's behalf.
</P>
<P>
But the families of the victims argue that moving the civil part
of the trial to the United States would "inevitably bring to
light manufacturing faults" in the aircraft.
</P>
<P>
The Flash Airlines charter company that ran the doomed flight has
since declared bankruptcy.
