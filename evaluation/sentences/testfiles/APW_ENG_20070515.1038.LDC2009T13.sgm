conservative allies

<P>
President-elect Nicolas Sarkozy faced his first political hurdle
even before taking office Wednesday, with members of his own
conservative party irked by plans to include rival Socialists in
a government spanning the left-right divide.
</P>
<P>
Socialist Party leader Francois Hollande denounced the overtures
as "depraved" and "seductive" maneuvers designed to increase
Sarkozy's power.
</P>
<P>
Former Prime Minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin stepped in Tuesday to
try to lower rising temperatures in Sarkozy's UMP party, saying
it was important that the new president "share his project with
people from other horizons."
</P>
<P>
Some members of the Union for a Popular Movement who helped the
conservative candidate win election May 6 have grumbled at
overtures in recent days to Socialists, apparently fearing
leftists could squeeze loyalists out of prominent posts.
</P>
<P>
Sarkozy's surprising pre-inaugural meetings with labor unions and
some leading Socialists reflect his effort to distance himself
from his one-time mentor, outgoing President Jacques Chirac, and
the economic stagnation and social tensions left over from his
12-year tenure.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin, a die-hard Chirac loyalist,
presented the outgoing president with his resignation on Tuesday.
Sarkozy is widely expected to name conservative four-time
minister Francois Fillon, a close confidant, to succeed Villepin.
</P>
<P>
The widely popular Bernard Kouchner, a former Socialist health
minister and founder of the Nobel-prize winning organization
Doctors Without Borders, is among those being considered as new
foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday afternoon, Anne Lauvergeon, head of the nuclear group
Areva and once a top adviser of former Socialist President
Francois Mitterrand, was seen entering Sarkozy's office. Sarkozy
also continued consultations with unions.
</P>
<P>
With a streamlined government of only 15 ministers, half of whom
are likely to be women, there was little room to reward the
faithful with ministries. Aides to Sarkozy have put the accent on
competence, not loyalty.
</P>
<P>
Patrick Devedjian -- who had been tapped as a potential minister
in Sarkozy's Cabinet -- bristled at the suggestion of Socialists
in government, insisting that "loyalty is not necessarily the
opposite of competence."
</P>
<P>
Sarkozy confidant Brice Hortefeux told colleagues Tuesday to cut
out the complaining. "Nicolas Sarkozy never promised a post to
anyone," Hortefeux said on RTL radio.
</P>
<P>
Sarkozy, elected with a mandate to rejuvenate France, takes
office Wednesday, replacing Chirac, who was to address the nation
Tuesday evening with a televised farewell message.
</P>
<P>
Sarkozy was expected to name his prime minister on Thursday.
Former Education Minister Francois Fillon was widely considered a
shoo-in. The full government was expected to be announced within
days, possibly as early as Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Socialist Party, whose candidate Segolene Royal lost to
Sarkozy, was among those protesting his reaching out to the left,
just as it tries to bolster its profile ahead of June legislative
elections.
</P>
<P>
Hollande, the party leader, said he spoke with Kouchner to warn
him that "if he accepts, he will be in a government of the right,
a majority of the right and have friends on the right ....
Everyone must face his own conscience and (code of) ethics."
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters, Hollande denounced the bid to lure
Socialists to the government as a move by Sarkozy to increase his
power and control, saying Sarkozy "backs away from no operation
-- seduction, depravity, intimidation, pressure."
</P>
<P>
Former Socialist Justice Minister Elisabeth Guigou accused
Sarkozy of trying to break the left ahead of the legislative vote
next month.
</P>
<P>
"I think ... those who accept are accomplices of a maneuver aimed
purely and simply at smashing the left in the legislative
elections," she said on France-Info radio.
</P>
<P>
The new government will need as large a majority as possible in
June legislative elections to easily pass the expected tough
economic and social reforms.
