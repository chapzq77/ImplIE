NKorea preparing to restart Yongbyon reactor: official
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
North Korea is preparing to restart its Yongbyon nuclear reactor
amid a deadlock in international disarmament talks, a Pyongyang
official said Friday.
</P>
<P>
"We are making thorough preparations to restore (nuclear
facilities)," said foreign ministry official Hyon Hak-Bong.
</P>
<P>
"You may say we have already started work to restore them," he
told reporters at the border truce village of Panmunjom before
the start of talks between the two Koreas on energy aid.
</P>
<P>
North Korea said last month it had stopped disabling the
plutonium-producing reactor and other plants and would consider
restoring them, in protest at Washington's refusal to drop it
from a terrorism blacklist.
</P>
<P>
The North's negotiating partners have reported that equipment was
being moved back to the site.
</P>
<P>
Asked by reporters when the reactor would be restarted, Hyon
replied:  "You'll come to know soon."
</P>
<P>
As part of a six-nation aid-for-disarmament agreement, the North
last November began disabling its Yongbyon plants.
</P>
<P>
In return the five negotiating partners -- South Korea, the
United States, Japan, China and Russia -- promised to provide one
million tons of heavy fuel oil or equivalent energy assistance to
the impoverished communist state.
</P>
<P>
In June the North handed over a list of its nuclear programmes
and facilities and the United States began the process of
removing it from a terrorism blacklist.
</P>
<P>
But Washington says it will not take the final step until the
North agrees on ways to verify its nuclear declaration.
</P>
<P>
Hyon, deputy chief of the foreign ministry's US affairs bureau,
said Washington should stop demanding an "unacceptable"
verification regime and immediately take Pyongyang off the
blacklist.
</P>
<P>
He said Washington's request for a thorough inspection was
reminiscent of its pre-war activity in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The US ransacked Iraq, insisting weapons of mass destruction
existed there, based on false intelligence reports, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the North was not required to agree to a verification
system for its nuclear declaration because verification was not
stipulated in the six-party talks.
</P>
<P>
"There isn't any agreement or secret diplomatic memorandum of
understanding (on verification) between North Korea and the US.
It is not in a six-party agreement."
</P>
<P>
On August 26 the North announced that in protest it had halted
disablement work and would consider restarting the reactor.
</P>
<P>
Nearly half of the promised energy aid has been delivered.
Officials from the two Koreas were meeting Friday to discuss
further deliveries.
</P>
<P>
Hwang Joon-Kook, head of the South Korean foreign ministry's
North Korean nuclear issue bureau, heads the Seoul delegation.
</P>
<P>
In London the International Institute for Strategic Studies said
Thursday that North Korea could put its nuclear programme back on
track in less than a year.
</P>
<P>
Uncertainty over the health of leader Kim Jong-Il means its
stalemate with Washington over its nuclear programme is likely to
continue, it added.
</P>
<P>
"Diplomatic efforts to stem the nuclear proliferation challenges
posed by Iran and North Korea are both deadlocked," IISS chief
John Chipman said.
</P>
<P>
"It will take North Korea less than one year to undo the steps
that up until August it was taking to disable its declared
nuclear facilities."
