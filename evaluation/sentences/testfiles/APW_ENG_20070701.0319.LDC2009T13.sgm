Jordan's King Abdullah II flatly rejected a confederation with
the Palestinians on Sunday, calling any such proposal at the
current time a "conspiracy" against his kingdom and the
Palestinians, a local newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
Despite government assertions to the contrary, speculation has
mounted in recent weeks that Jordan may want to assume a
protectorate role in the West Bank by forming a confederation
with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
In newspaper remarks published Sunday, Abdullah said he was "fed
up talking about this issue."
</P>
<P>
"We reject the formula of confederation and federation and we
believe that proposing this issue at this specific period is a
conspiracy against both Palestine and Jordan," Abdullah told the
independent Al-Ghad newspaper.
</P>
<P>
This key U.S. ally fears that any confederation before a final
settlement of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict could give
credence to Israeli hard-liners, who have urged making Jordan a
home for the West Bank's Arabs.
</P>
<P>
Under a 1950 deal, Jordan administered the West Bank and east
Jerusalem until Israel captured them in the 1967 war. Abdullah's
father, the late King Hussein, severed administrative links with
the West Bank in 1988, handing responsibility to the Palestine
Liberation Organization under its late leader, Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Hussein said a Jordanian-Palestinian confederation was possible
once the Palestinians had an independent state.
</P>
<P>
In May, the Israeli Maariv daily said that Jordan was pressing
hard for a confederation with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
But Abdullah echoed his father's position Sunday, saying it was
"premature to talk about the shape of future relations with
Palestine and we will not tackle this issue until an independent
Palestinian state on Palestinian soil is established."
</P>
<P>
When asked if there was Israeli or U.S. pressure on Jordan to
accept a confederation with the Palestinians, he said, "We will
not accept such solutions no matter what the pressures are."
</P>
<P>
The king harshly rebuked Israel in the interview, underlining his
frustration with its peace policies.
</P>
<P>
Despite cordial relations with his neighbor under a 1994 peace
treaty, Abdullah described Israel as a "solid enemy" of the
Palestinians, saying the Jewish state "will not achieve the
security it desires, unless Palestinian political rights are
addressed."
</P>
<P>
Abdullah also rebuked the militant Palestinian Hamas movement for
its military takeover of the Gaza Strip last month.
</P>
<P>
He warned that Hamas's conquest of the coastal strip would
"undermine Palestinian hopes for ending the Israeli occupation
and setting up an independent Palestinians state."
</P>
<P>
The king said he had hoped for a "better outcome" for the
Palestinians from last month's Mideast summit in the Egyptian Red
Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheik, but did not elaborate. The meeting
brought him together with Israeli, Palestinian and Egyptian
leaders as a show of support for Palestinian President Mahmoud
Abbas of Fatah.
</P>
<P>
At the summit, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert pledged to free
250 Fatah prisoners, and there was talk of peace negotiations
toward creation of a Palestinian state.
