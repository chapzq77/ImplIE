Ryanair sues European Commission over German funding of Munich
airport terminal

Ryanair Holdings PLC said Wednesday it is suing the European
Commission over its refusal to investigate whether German
government funding for a Munich airport terminal amounts to
illegal state aid for Lufthansa AG.
</P>
<P>
The suit filed in the European Court of First Instance, the
second-highest EU court, is the latest salvo in an apparent tit-
for-tat battle between Ryanair and EU competition authorities.
</P>
<P>
For the past two years Ryanair has accused European leaders of
demonstrating bias in favor of the continent's national flag
carriers, citing a range of government financial supports
benefiting Lufthansa, Air France, Alitalia and Olympic Airways of
Greece.
</P>
<P>
Ryanair has been subjected to a series of EU investigations into
its deals with far-flung, small airports, most recently in July
when investigators began probing whether Ryanair's exceptionally
cheap contracts with three airports in Germany and Finland
violated competition laws. The EU also is looking into Ryanair's
contracts with airports in the Mediterranean islands of Sardinia
and Malta.
</P>
<P>
The Ryanair announcement came on the same day that European
Consumer Affairs Commissioner Maglena Kuneva published a report
alleging widespread deceptive practices in the on-line sales of
airline tickets.
</P>
<P>
The report did not single out Ryanair, which pioneered the rise
of Web-based sales in Europe and is frequently criticized by
consumer groups for its plethora of add-on charges, including for
conventional check-ins and use of credit cards. But Kuneva warned
that offending airlines would be identified in four months if
they didn't reform how their Web sites tacked on costs to ticket
prices.
</P>
<P>
Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said Ryanair had waited two years
for EU authorities to act on the airline's original complaint
against German state aid to build and operate Terminal 2 in
Munich.
</P>
<P>
O'Leary said Lufthansa and its partner airlines enjoyed
"exclusive use" of the terminal, which was built chiefly with
more than euro1 billion (US$1.4 billion) in state aid. He said
the terminal had run up losses exceeding euro100 million (US$140
million) annually.
</P>
<P>
"No private investor would have invested in the loss-making
facility and then granted exclusive access to just one airline.
Lufthansa is therefore receiving substantial state aid at Munich
Airport, which distorts competition in the European air transport
market," O'Leary said.
</P>
<P>
"Munich Airport's refusal to allow Ryanair to use this facility
has subjected passengers in Bavaria to the stranglehold of
Lufthansa's high fares and fuel surcharges," he said.
</P>
<P>
Ryanair mounted a similarly themed lawsuit last week against the
European Commission alleging it has ignored a previous Ryanair
complaint against French government policies that allegedly favor
Air France. That lawsuit was also filed in the European Court of
First Instance.
</P>
<P>
"The French government's operation of massively discounted
domestic airport fees in France -- almost all of which supports
Air France -- amounts to approximately euro1 billion (US$1.4
billion) of illegal state aid to the benefit of Air France, yet
the commission has refused to do anything about this for the last
18 months," O'Leary said.
</P>
<P>
EU antitrust authorities further annoyed Ryanair in June by
rejecting its takeover terms for rival Irish carrier Aer Lingus,
ruling that a combined operation would create a Ryanair monopoly
in Ireland.
</P>
<P>
The EU in this decade has approved a string of other European
mergers involving Air France, Dutch carrier KLM, Lufthansa and
the defunct Swissair.
