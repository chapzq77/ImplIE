German chancellor meets Polish president over EU treaty

BERLIN, Oct. 12 (Xinhua)
</P>
<P>
German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Friday met with Polish
President Lech Kaczynski over a disputed European Union treaty
draft a week before the upcoming EU summit.
</P>
<P>
Kaczynski told reporters before the meeting in Berlin that "
there are still details to smooth out, details which in one or
two cases are fairly important."
</P>
<P>
Still, the president said he was "optimistic" that an agreement
could be reached during the summit in Lisbon on Oct. 18.
</P>
<P>
Merkel said she was ready to clear up the remaining issues with
the Polish president so that the 27 EU members could ratify the
treaty draft in the Lisbon meeting as planned.
</P>
<P>
At the EU summit in June, EU leaders signed an agreement on
hammering out the final text for a new treaty to reform the EU's
institutions, ending a two-year stalemate after France and the
Netherlands rejected the previously proposed constitution in
referendums.
</P>
<P>
Poland had managed to persuade EU partners to delay the
implementation of a new voting system which some EU nations fear
will give too much power to bigger states.
