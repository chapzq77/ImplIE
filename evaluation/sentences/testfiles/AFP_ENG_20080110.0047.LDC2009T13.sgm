Colombian rebels give proof that 8 hostages are alive: Rojas
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rebels from the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia have
delivered proof to Venezuelan authorities that eight high-profile
hostages they are holding are alive, ex-hostage Clara Rojas told
Colombia's radio Caracol.
</P>
<P>
The proof was delivered to Venezuelan Interior Minister Ramon
Rodriguez Chacin, who traveled aboard one of the Venezuelan
helicopters that flew to a secret site in Colombia to pick up
Rojas, who ran the presidential campaign of Franco- Colombian
Ingrid Betancourt -- still held hostage -- and former legislator
Consuelo Gonzalez de Perdomo.
</P>
<P>
FARC rebels kidnapped Gonzalez, now 57, in 2001 and Rojas, now
44, in February 2002.
</P>
<P>
The guerrillas agreed to release the two women to the leftist
government of neighboring Venezuela with mediation from the
International Committee of the Red Cross, but not directly to
their foes in the Colombian government of conservative President
Alvaro Uribe.
</P>
<P>
"We were a group of ten people, they were authorized to give
proof that they were alive and the guerrilla commanders delivered
it this morning" to the Venezuelan representative, Rojas told
Caracol.
</P>
<P>
Chavez will receive the evidence and then pass it on to the
relatives of the hostages, Rojas said.
</P>
<P>
The group included former members of congress Luis Eduardo
Gechem, Gloria Polanco and Orlando Beltran, as well as the former
governor of Meta department, Alan Jara, and four army and police
officers.
