ban earlier this month.

licenses were still sold in some areas for high profits after 14
government departments, including the Ministry of Culture, the
State Administration for Industry and Commerce and the Ministry
of Information Industry, banned the practise.

The sales were illegal and would be stopped according to laws and
regulations, Tuo said.

"There are currently almost 120,000 Internet bars in China, which
meets the demand of the market," said Tuo, adding an increase in
the number would lead to "negative competition".

bars must be directly managed by the school, operated on a not-
for-profit basis and must not be leased to individuals.
