Dozen illegal migrants to Gabon die in shipwreck: minister
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At least 12 clandestine migrants headed for Gabon drowned when
their boat capsized off the shores of Libreville, Gabon's
Interior Minister Andre Mba Obame said Monday.
</P>
<P>
"A boat which was carrying illegal migrants capsized," Mba Obame
told AFP, adding that the exact date of the accident and the
number of people on board were not known.
</P>
<P>
"We have recovered a dozen bodies," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to sources at local charities, the boat was carrying
people from other west African countries.
</P>
<P>
The interior minister said that the country frequently finds the
bodies of would-be immigrants whose makeshift boats capsize at
sea trying to reach Gabon's shores.
</P>
<P>
"The same network of traffickers who send illegal migrants to
Europe also bring them here to Gabon," he said.
</P>
<P>
Oil-rich Gabon is a sought-after destination where some 400,000
people, out of a total population of 1.3 million, are immigrants,
many of them without proper papers.
</P>
<P>
During the oil boom years of the 1970s, Gabon welcomed immigrants
as much needed workers, but since the late 1980s it has tried to
put the brakes on accepting new arrivals.
