Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice plans to travel next week to
Germany for discussions of possible new sanctions against Iran,
the U.S. State Department said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Rice will be in Germany and Switzerland on Jan. 22-23.
</P>
<P>
In Germany, she will participate in a meeting of the five
countries holding permanent U.N. Security Council seats, plus
Germany, on Iran, State Department spokesman Sean McCormack told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
"The whole strategy here is to use various kinds of diplomatic
pressure, at a gradually increasing rate, to try to get a
different set of decisions out of the Iranian leadership,"
McCormack said.
</P>
<P>
Iran claims it wants to create an industrial-scale enrichment
program to create nuclear fuel, and denies it is interested in
the activity's other application: making weapons-grade uranium,
as the United States has long maintained.
</P>
<P>
In Davos, Rice will address the annual World Economic Forum and
meet with senior Swiss officials, McCormack said.
</P>
<P>
She also plans talks on NATO's efforts in Afghanistan.
