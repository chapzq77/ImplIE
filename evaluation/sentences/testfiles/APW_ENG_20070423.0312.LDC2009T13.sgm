Javier Solana, the EU's foreign policy chief, will meet with top
Iranian negotiator Ali Larijani Wednesday in Ankara to see if
Iran can be persuaded to halt uranium enrichment in exchange for
negotiations about economic incentives.
</P>
<P>
"I am going to meet him Wednesday ... in Ankara (to) see if we
can move to a negotiation," Solana said on arrival at an EU
foreign ministers meeting. He did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
In a related devlopment later Monday, the foreign ministers
approved -- without debate -- a second round of U.N. sanctions
adopted by the Security Council in March. These ban Iranian arms
exports and freeze the assets of 28 additional individuals and
organizations involved in the country's nuclear and missile
programs.
</P>
<P>
About a third of these individuals have links to Iran's
Revolutionary Guard, an elite military corps.
</P>
<P>
The package also calls for voluntary restrictions on travel by
the individuals subject to sanctions, on arms sales to Iran, and
on new financial assistance or loans to the Iranian government.
</P>
<P>
In the bid to push Iran to drop some aspects of its nuclear
program, Solana is negotiating on behalf of permanent U.N.
Security Council members France, Britain, Russia, the United
States and China, as well as Germany.
</P>
<P>
The international community wants Tehran to freeze uranium
enrichment work before any talks can be held on a package of
economic and other incentives for Iran, including assistance for
its nuclear power generation program.
</P>
<P>
Iran has started feeding small amounts of uranium gas into
centrifuges that can enrich it to weapons-grade level and is
already running more than 1,300 of the machines, according to an
International Atomic Energy Agency document obtained last week by
The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
The IAEA has protested Iran's decision to prevent agency
inspectors from visiting the country's heavy water reactor,
which, when built, will produce plutonium.
</P>
<P>
Enriched uranium and plutonium can both be used for the fissile
core of nuclear warheads. Iran denies it plans to produce nuclear
weapons, saying it only wants to generate energy.
