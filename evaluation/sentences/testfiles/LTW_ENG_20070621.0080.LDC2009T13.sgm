Bush Vetoes Bill to Ease Stem Cell Research Funding
</HEADLINE>

WASHINGTON
</P>
<P>
President Bush vetoed a bill easing federal funding for embryonic
stem cell research Wednesday, calling on House Democrats to send
him a bill funding alternative stem cell research that does not
destroy human embryos.
</P>
<P>
``If this legislation becomes law, it would compel American
taxpayers -- for the first time in our history -- to support the
deliberate destruction of human embryos,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
At an East Room ceremony attended by patients and scientists who
oppose research that involves human embryos, Bush also issued an
executive order directing the Health and Human Services
Department to promote research into ``pluripotent'' stem cells
that have the potential to regenerate cell types and body tissues
without use of embryonic stem cells, making them prime weapons in
the war against diseases.
</P>
<P>
Bush, in his second veto of stem cell research, said he would
``not allow our nation to cross this moral line,'' adding:
``Destroying human life in the hopes of saving human life is not
ethical, and it is not the only option before us.'' But
Democratic House leaders vowed to keep passing embryonic stem
cell research bills, attaching them to ``must-pass'' legislation
and arguing that embryonic stem cell research offers the greatest
hope to combat diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's.
</P>
<P>
``We will continue bringing this up until we have a pro-stem cell
research president,'' said Rep. Diana DeGette, D-Colo. Noting
that a recent Gallup Poll found that 65 percent of Americans
support embryonic stem cell research, DeGette, a leader on the
issue, added: ``If the president doesn't at least sit down and
talk to us about this, it will be an election issue.'' In August
2001, Bush said he would allow federal funding only of existing
stem cell lines, banning harvesting of new embryonic cells for
research. Some scientists have argued that the previous stem cell
lines were contaminated and unstable -- and that stem cells from
embryos hold the most promise for combating illnesses, such as
Parkinson's disease, spinal cord injuries and strokes.
</P>
<P>
But White House press secretary Tony Snow argued that Bush's
policy has actually opened the door to federal stem cell
research. ``The notion that we are against stem cell research is
wrong,'' he said. ``No administration has been more aggressive.''
And he noted that the veto would not affect private funding of
embryonic stem cell research, but that Bush ``has just determined
that it is morally inappropriate'' for federal taxpayers who may
disagree to fund it.
</P>
<P>
On taking control of Congress in January, Democrats made stem
cell research funding a top priority. The bill passed 238 to 194
in the House last month, short of the two-thirds vote necessary
to override Bush's veto.
</P>
<P>
A number of high-profile Republicans have supported the effort.
Former first lady Nancy Reagan, during President Reagan's battle
with Alzheimer's disease, urged Bush to fund the research.
</P>
<P>
And Rep. Michael N. Castle, the Delaware Republican who
introduced the current bill, said it ``draws a strict ethical
line by only allowing federally funded research on stem cell
lines that were derived ethically'' from embryos no longer needed
in fertility clinics.
</P>
<P>
But Democrats hoped to remind voters that a Republican president
vetoed the funding.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., said she was
``profoundly disappointed'' that Bush ``has once again stood in
the face of overwhelming public support to deny the hope of
millions of Americans who are suffering from debilitating
diseases'' and vowed to continue enacting the legislation.
</P>
<P>
And House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., sent an e-mail to
Democratic supporters about the issue, soliciting contributions
to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.
