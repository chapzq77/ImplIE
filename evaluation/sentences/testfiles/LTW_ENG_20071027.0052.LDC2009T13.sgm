`Macbeth' Gets It Half Right

"Macbeth" occupies a special place in Verdi's career. After its
1847 premiere (Verdi revised it in 1865), the composer dedicated
it to his beloved father-in-law, calling it "dearer to me than
all my other operas." Verdi reportedly made the first Macbeth and
Lady Macbeth rehearse their great duet 150 times -- the last time
with cloaks over their costumes, in the theater lobby, while the
world premiere audience waited impatiently.

With its bleak E-minor tonalities and eerie, muted woodwind
writing, "Macbeth" is a nightmare in music. Giddy ceremonial
numbers sound with brutal irony, and the grief of the Scottish
people and the hero Macduff take on an almost unbearable pathos.

The Metropolitan Opera, which last performed "Macbeth" in 1988,
got some of this right in its new production. In the Serbian
baritone Zeljko Lucic, it has a Macbeth of the highest caliber,
vocally and dramatically. Lucic sang Monday with unfailing beauty
at all levels of dynamics, from a tortured whisper to a
confident, embracing full voice, his sound sometimes seeming to
issue from a twilight world of anguish. The evening's highlight
came in the last scene, when Lucic's Macbeth, broken and
bewildered, poured out "Pieta, rispetto, amore" with a buttery
legato and soft-grained but potent, soulful tone.

Alas, his Lady Macbeth was not remotely his equal. Maria
Guleghina gave forth an ear-splitting array of shrieks and
squeaks, sometimes breathing in the middle of words, sometimes
omitting consonants altogether when the going got rougher. By and
large, the sounds she emitted had only a glancing relationship to
Verdi's music. The less said about her titter-inducing
histrionics, the better.

As Macduff, tenor Dimitri Pittas sang "Ah, la paterno mano" with
a bright and pleasing, but monochromatic, timbre, wanting a touch
more abandon. A grave, dignified Banquo, John Relyea offered a
fine sense of style and unfocused tone. Russell Thomas was
Malcolm, delivering his handful of lines with zest and
incisiveness.

The Scottish people are a character unto themselves in Verdi's
nationalistic reading of Shakespeare's tragedy, and the
Metropolitan Opera Chorus under Donald Palumbo sang splendidly.
As shaped by conductor James Levine, the desolate chorus "Patria
oppressa" throbbed like a wound, the choristers' sound ranging
from a howl of grief to weary, halting whimpers.
</P>
<P>
Levine's savage, venomous reading of the score was beyond praise,
studded with grim, yawning silences and chords that thudded and
crashed with the finality of death. Mark Thompson's handsome
black sets -- including a vertiginous cyclorama against which a
forest festered in bruise-like purples and blues -- were filled
by director Adrian Noble with inanities: witches decked out like
Mary Poppins gone bad, Lady Macbeth bumping and grinding her way
through her drinking song like a tenth-rate Carmen, pointless
gropings and swinging lamps. Verdi's dearest opera deserved
better.
