Gorbachev calls for justice for murdered Russian journalist by
Conor Humphries
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev on Wednesday joined the
family of murdered Russian journalist Anna Politkovskaya in
calling for officials to step up their efforts to find her
killers.
</P>
<P>
"We must put the question firmly before the law enforcement
authorities. It should not be like this. The criminals in this
case must be caught and charged," Gorbachev said at a
presentation of Politkovskaya's collected works.
</P>
<P>
Released eight months after Politkovskaya was gunned down by
unknown assailants in Moscow, "For What" is the first book
published under the author's name in Russia since 2002.
</P>
<P>
Her books have been published in various European languages since
2001.
</P>
<P>
A renowned Kremlin critic, Politkovskaya was famous for her
reporting on human rights abuses committed by Russian troops and
allied Chechen militias during the two wars Moscow launched in
Chechnya since 1994 to contain separatist ambitions there.
</P>
<P>
Colleagues and family members used the occasion Wednesday to
honour her work and voice their frustration that more is not
being done to solve the murder.
</P>
<P>
"The worst thing is that we still don't have information about
the investigation, although more than eight months have gone
past," said Politkovskaya's sister Yelena Kudimova.
</P>
<P>
Politkovskaya's former editor Dmitry Muratov said her newspaper
would remain silent about the results of its own investigation
and watch the official probe closely to see if it would lead
anywhere.
</P>
<P>
"Our trust has its limits," said Muratov, editor of the semi-
weekly opposition newspaper Novaya Gazeta.
</P>
<P>
"If after a certain time we are convinced that the investigation
is following a forced politicized path, then we will publish all
of the material that the newspaper has managed to collect in the
past eight months."
</P>
<P>
He said that the paper was holding off on releasing details due
to the possible danger of "being left one-on-one" with the
dangerous individuals behind the crime without the protection of
law enforcement.
</P>
<P>
Novaya Gazeta on Monday said it had identified two top Chechen
officials it suspects of ordering the killing, but declined to
name them.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to journalists after the presentation, Muratov said that
the newspaper's offer of a one-million-dollar (740,000-euro)
reward for information in the case "has helped."
</P>
<P>
He said a second edition of Politkovskaya's works may be
published with details from the newspaper's investigation.
</P>
<P>
Despite the frustration over the lack of justice, Politkovskaya's
colleagues voiced hope that the posthumous publication would do
some justice to the reporter's work.
</P>
<P>
"I think people will read this in Russia and around the world,"
said Gorbachev, a shareholder in Novaya Gazeta, who said he knew
Politkovskaya personally.
</P>
<P>
"We need to remember people like Anna, who in any situation could
maintain their integrity, their honour and their bravery."
</P>
<P>
Politkovskaya's son Ilya said that no one had interfered with the
book's production and distribution, and that it had become the
No. 2 bestselling book in Moscow as of last week.
</P>
<P>
"I am happy it has become a bestseller. It is just a shame this
only happened after her death," he said.
