US Treasury, mortgage rates keep tumbling

Investors poured more money into Treasurys on Thursday, sending
yields to record lows again even as the Treasury Department said
it would sell record amounts of notes next week.
</P>
<P>
Usually, a boost in supply would dampen prices and raise yields.
However, after the Federal Reserve said Tuesday that it was
considering buying long-term government debt, investors are not
yet worried about a drop-off in demand.
</P>
<P>
The 10-year Treasury note's yield sank as low as 2.04 percent,
and the 30-year bond's yield dropped as low as 2.52 percent. Low
yields are good for borrowers with rates tied to Treasurys, but
bad for investors in funds that are swarming to Treasury issues
for safety.
</P>
<P>
"Yields are just at jaw-dropping levels," said Kim Rupert,
managing director of global fixed income analysis at Action
Economics. "Obviously at some point it comes to an end, but it's
not clear where ... If this market has told us anything, it's
don't underestimate the powerful demand for Treasurys."
</P>
<P>
The Treasury said it would auction $38 billion in two-year notes
and $28 in five-year notes. Both those figures were the highest
amounts on record.
</P>
<P>
It's possible that if enough supply comes into the market, it
will keep yields low enough for a long enough period of time that
investors will look for riskier assets offering higher returns.
That's happening a bit already with mortgage-backed securities,
the rates of which are falling and helping bring down mortgage
rates for homeowners.
</P>
<P>
Mortgage giant Freddie Mac on Thursday reported that rates had
fallen to the lowest level on records dating back to 1971.
Average rates on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages sank to 5.19
percent from the year's previous low of 5.47 percent set last
week.
</P>
<P>
Demand for corporate bonds has also started to trickle back since
the Fed slashed its target rate to nearly zero on Tuesday, but
the recovery process is expected to be extremely slow. In another
blow to frazzled investors Thursday, Standard &amp; Poor's
Ratings Service on revised its outlook for General Electric Co.
and its finance arm, GE Capital Corp., to negative from stable.
</P>
<P>
"In the meantime, the best game in town is to follow the Treasury
and the Federal Reserve right to the bank," wrote Morgan Keegan
analyst Kevin Giddis in a note.
</P>
<P>
The two-year Treasury note rose 4/32 to 101 2/32, and its yield
fell to 0.70 percent from 0.75 percent late Wednesday. The
10-year note rose 1 5/32 to 114 28/32, and its yield fell to 2.08
percent from 2.21 percent. The 30-year bond rose 2 16/32 to 140
2/32, and its yield fell to 2.55 percent from 2.66 percent.
</P>
<P>
The three-month Treasury bill yielded less than zero percent, and
was only marginally higher than on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Economic data released Thursday were not as grim as many
anticipated, but still evinced a very weak climate.
</P>
<P>
The Labor Department reported that new applications for jobless
benefits fell to a seasonally adjusted 554,000 last week -- lower
than expected -- from an upwardly revised figure of 575,000 the
previous week. But the tally remains near 26-year highs.
</P>
<P>
The New York-based Conference Board, a private research group,
said its index of leading economic indicators fell for the second
straight month, dropping 0.4 percent in November. That was
slightly better than expected.
</P>
<P>
And the Philadelphia Federal Reserve said regional manufacturing
is contracting in December, but not by as much as in November.
