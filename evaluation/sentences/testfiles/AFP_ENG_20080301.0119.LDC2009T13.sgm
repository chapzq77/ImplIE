Israeli strikes on the Gaza Strip killed at least 52 Palestinians
on Saturday, medics said, making it one of Israel's deadliest
operations since the outbreak of the Palestinian uprising in
2000.

At least 50 Palestinians, including at least 13 civilians, were
killed in a massive air and ground incursion in northern Gaza,

More than 150 people were wounded in the northern operation,
Hassanein said.

At least 16 of the Palestinians killed were militants: 13
fighters from the Islamist movement Hamas which controls Gaza,
two from Islamic Jihad, and one from the Popular Resistance
Committees.

Two Israeli soldiers were also killed in the latest fighting, and
another seven wounded, including two officers, the army said,

The main operation was launched before dawn when Israeli tanks
supported by helicopters pushed into the town and refugee camp of
Jabaliya in the northern Gaza Strip and continued the assault
throughout the day.

At least 287 people have been killed since Israel and the
Palestinians relaunched formal peace talks at a US conference in
