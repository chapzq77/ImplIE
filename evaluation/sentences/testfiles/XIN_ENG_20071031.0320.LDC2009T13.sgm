MADRID, Oct. 31 (Xinhua)
</P>
<P>
Spain's Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero said on
Wednesday that the harsh sentences dictated on Wednesday for the
March 11 of 2004 terrorist attacks have made justice and
established "the truth of the facts."
</P>
<P>
Zapatero recalled the victims on behalf of all Spaniards and
expressed his closeness with the families that lost one of their
loved ones that day.
</P>
<P>
Spain's National Court, the highest court in this European
country, sentenced two Moroccans convicted as the authors of the
attacks to 40,000 years in prison, and sentenced a Spaniard to
35, 000 years for facilitating the explosives.
</P>
<P>
Two other people implicated in the crime received sentences of 15
and 12 years, while eight of the accused were acquitted.
</P>
<P>
Zapatero expressed his confidence that the sentences will grant
comfort and relieve to those who lost a loved one that day,
although nobody will be able to restore their loss.
</P>
<P>
The trial established "the truth of the facts" and the
responsibility of the authors, he said.
</P>
<P>
The sentence is the best lesson so that all parties commit
themselves to unity against terrorism, he added said.
</P>
<P>
In the worse terrorist day in Spain's history, the almost
simultaneous train bombings in Madrid left at least 191 killed
and 1,800 injured on March 11 of 2004.
