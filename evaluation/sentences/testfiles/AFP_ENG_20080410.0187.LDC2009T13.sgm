Police raid French employers' federation
</HEADLINE>

Police investigating claims that French businesses for years
secretly funded their trade union adversaries on Thursday raided
the Paris headquarters of the country's top employers'
federation.The Medef federation issued a statement saying it was
"cooperating fully with legal authorities to help them shed light
on the UIMM (metal and mining lobby) affair."
</P>
<P>
The powerful UIMM, a member of Medef, has been under police
investigation after it was revealed that some 19 million euros
(30 million dollars) in cash had been withdrawn from UIMM
accounts since 2000.
</P>
<P>
A source close to the probe said Thursday that the investigators
were in particular looking for emails between the Medef chief
Laurence Parisot and other Medef members concerning the system of
UIMM cash withdrawals.
</P>
<P>
The raid came a day after a former president of the UIMM, Daniel
Dewavrin, was placed under investigation in the affair.
</P>
<P>
Dewavrin said in March that Parisot had been informed about the
cash withdrawals, but she has denied that.
</P>
<P>
A Medef official, Hugues-Arnaud Meyer, on Thursday told
journalists gathered outside the Medef building that "we have
nothing to hide" and that "everyone knows that Laurence Parisot
was not informed" of the withdrawals.
</P>
<P>
The UIMM's head Denis Gautier-Sauvagnac was forced to step down
and placed under investigation over the revelation in September
that millions had been withdrawn.
</P>
<P>
Investigators believe they have stumbled on hidden "war-funds"
used by the century-old metals federation to subsidise trade
unions and "buy" agreements to end industrial disputes, in an
arrangement stretching back decades.
</P>
<P>
They are also looking into suggestions of illicit political party
funding, with the questioning in February of a former
intelligence chief who alleged the UIMM helped pay for Valery
Giscard d'Estaing's presidential campaign in 1974.
</P>
<P>
Shock over the revelations turned to outrage when it emerged that
the UIMM offered its disgraced ex-boss Gautier-Sauvagnac a 1.5
million euro severance package.
</P>
<P>
The affair has led to a fierce battle of wills between would-be
reformers and a powerful industrial old guard.
</P>
<P>
It pits Parisot against the UIMM, Medef's most powerful branch,
whose 45,000 members include the carmaker Peugeot Citroen and the
nuclear giant Areva.
