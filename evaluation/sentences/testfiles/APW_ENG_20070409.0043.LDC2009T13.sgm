Afghanistan

KABUL, Afghanistan 2007-04-09 00:14:31 UTC

Roadside bombs in southern Afghanistan killed seven NATO
soldiers, officials said, as militants struck back during the the
alliance's biggest anti-Taliban offensive in the world's most
fertile opium-producing region.
</P>
<P>
Separately, a purported spokesman for the Taliban said the
kidnapped translator for an Italian journalist was beheaded
Sunday. The Afghan government confirmed the death.
</P>
<P>
Six troops died and one was injured when one of the roadside
bombs struck their vehicle, the alliance said in a statement.
Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper confirmed they were
Canadian troops, Canadian Press reported.
</P>
<P>
A separate roadside bomb Sunday killed one NATO soldier and
wounded two, NATO said. Officials did not release the nationality
of those soldiers and did not give details or say where exactly
in the south the attacks took place.
</P>
<P>
The Canadians' deaths appeared to be the biggest single combat
loss for foreign troops in Afghanistan since June 2005, when a
U.S. helicopter crashed. Sixteen American troops died after the
aircraft was apparently hit by a rocket-propelled grenade.
</P>
<P>
The fatalities underline how virulent Afghanistan's Taliban-led
resistance remains, more than five years after a U.S.-led
invasion drove the hardline militia from power for harboring al-
Qaida.
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere in southern Afghanistan, freelance journalist and
translator Ajmal Naqshbandi was beheaded after more than a month
in captivity. He had been kidnapped along with Italian journalist
Daniele Mastrogiacomo and a driver, who had been beheaded
earlier.
</P>
<P>
Mastrogiacomo, who worked for the daily La Repubblica, was
released March 19 in a much criticized swap for five Taliban
militants.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban had made a similar demand in return for Naqshbandi's
release, but the government declined to respond, so he was
beheaded, said Shahabuddin Atal, who claimed to be a spokesman
for regional Taliban commander Mullah Dadullah.
</P>
<P>
The latest violence came days after more than 1,000 NATO and
Afghan troops retook Sangin district in the opium-producing
Helmand province.
</P>
<P>
The next step will be for NATO to hand over control of the area
to Afghan security forces, said Lt. Col. Maria Carl, a
spokeswoman for ISAF. She added that NATO already has transported
about 500 Afghan forces to the south.
</P>
<P>
The operation to retake the town from militants started late
Wednesday and is part of NATO's largest ever offensive in
Afghanistan, Operation Achilles, launched last month to flush out
Taliban militants from the northern tip of Helmand province.
</P>
<P>
About 4,500 NATO and 1,000 Afghan forces are in and around
Helmand province as part of Operation Achilles. In the last
several months, Taliban militants and foreign fighters have
streamed into the province, according to U.S. and NATO officials.
