Israeli police commander resigns in scandal involving underworld
figures

JERUSALEM 2007-02-18 16:20:26 UTC

<P>
Israeli police commander Moshe Karadi on Sunday resigned from his
post after a government commission found he should not continue
in his post because of involvement in a scandal involving
underworld figures.
</P>
<P>
Karadi announced his intention to resign at a news conference at
police headquarters in Jerusalem. He said the government would
determine when he would step down.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Sunday, commission chairman Vardi Zeiler, a retired
judge, told a news conference that Karadi must be fired for
failing to ensure police thoroughly investigated the 1999 murder
of a suspected crime boss and for ignoring ties between senior
police officers and top organized crime figures. Karadi was not
police commissioner at the time of the killing, but a
departmental head.
</P>
<P>
The two other members of the panel wrote in the findings that
Karadi's tenure should not be extended after it expires this
summer. The commissioner's term is three years, but the Public
Security minister has an option to extend it for another year.
</P>
<P>
Terminating Karadi's appointment would "highlight a clear norm
for generations to come that someone who behaves like Karadi
would be unable to complete his term as police commissioner,"
Zeiler told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"If the (panel's) suspicions are correct, this is the beginning
of a very corrupt police force, and the infiltration of
underworld figures to the police, which corrupts the police and
the regime," Zeiler added.
</P>
<P>
Karadi insisted that the allegations against him were untrue, but
said he was resigning to "set a personal example" and spare the
police the harm of a scandal swirling around it.
</P>
<P>
The Zeiler commission was formed to examine whether police
properly closed the case of the murder, in which a rogue police
officer confessed to shooting a suspected crime boss hospitalized
under police guard after an assassination attempt.
</P>
<P>
The officer, who said he operated at the behest of a well-known
Israeli crime family, was later murdered in Mexico, allegedly by
members of the crime family because of his confession. The case
was later closed after police concluded there wasn't enough
evidence.
</P>
<P>
Karadi was a top official in southern Israel at the time of the
1999 killing, and the commission rebuked him for promoting a
police commander suspected in hushing up the case on behalf of
the crime family that allegedly hired the murdered officer.
</P>
<P>
The Karadi case is just the latest in a string of scandals and
controversies involving Israel's top leadership.
</P>
<P>
Lt. Gen. Dan Halutz recently resigned as the military chief of
staff after coming under withering fire for the flawed summer war
against Lebanese guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
President Moshe Katsav, now on a leave of absence, has been
accused of preying on women who worked for him, and faces
allegations of rape, sexual assault and abuse of power.
</P>
<P>
Former Justice Minister Haim Ramon was recently convicted in a
separate sexual misconduct case, and Prime Minister Ehud Olmert
is under investigation for his role in the sale of a government-
controlled bank, and accused of improprieties in a string of real
estate deals.
</P>
<P>
Top tax officials, along with a long-standing Olmert aide, are
embroiled in an influence-peddling investigation, and Avraham
Hirchson has come under scrutiny for his conduct in connection
with an embezzlement scheme at a not-for-profit organization
before he became finance minister.
