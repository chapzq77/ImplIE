ATLANTA -- There's not a bit of bunting in sight. No rope line to
hold back the rabid throngs. Secret Service protection? More like
one endlessly patient young woman who answers the phone and
greets strangers walking through the door with cheery aplomb.
</P>
<P>
At first glance, this conservatively appointed office suite -
muted carpeting, framed Ronald Reagan photo on the wall - in a
highrise office building could be home to any of the countless
well-connected doctors, lawyers or investment professionals who
discretely keep Atlanta ticking.
</P>
<P>
Instead, it's the epicenter of a political earthquake. Maybe.
</P>
<P>
"There are several things we want to get in place before we would
make an announcement," Bob Barr says during a recent interview at
his consulting firm, Liberty Strategies LLC in Atlanta. "We
anticipate having them nailed down in very short order."
</P>
<P>
As rhetorical stemwinders go, that's not quite up there with "Ask
not what your country can do for you ? " Still, it's
tantalizingly, if incrementally, more detailed than what Barr,
59, had to say at the Heartland Libertarian Conference in Kansas
City two weeks earlier.
</P>
<P>
There, the former Republican congressman from Georgia's 7th
District declared he was forming an "exploratory committee" and
would run for president as a Libertarian - if "sufficient
numbers" of people were for it.
</P>
<P>
The tremors were felt immediately and everywhere. While bloggers
debated Barr's electability and Libertarian cred - he's been a
party member since just 2006 - his "exploratory" Web site
(www.bobbarr2008.com) showed about $25,000 in contributions
within two days. (By Friday morning, it was nearing $41,000.)
</P>
<P>
James Peniston of Duluth, Ga., was among the first donors. "It's
the beginning of my personal Boston Tea Party," Peniston, 62,
said of his $100 donation. "I'm fed up with the two-party
system."
</P>
<P>
'Bless their hearts'
</P>
<P>
He's apparently not alone. The exploratory committee polled
likely voters and found that 7 percent said they would vote for
unannounced candidate Barr. Next up was a George Will column
about Barr's potentially "ruinous" impact on presumed Republican
nominee John McCain's chances.
</P>
<P>
So, has Barr heard anything - veiled threats, promises of plum
ambassadorships - from the McCain forces lately?
</P>
<P>
"No, not directly," replies Barr, who had to give up his weekly
op-ed column in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution when he launched
the exploratory committee.
</P>
<P>
Of the few "more traditional" Republicans he has heard
discouraging words from: "They have this sort of idea in their
minds, bless their hearts, that nobody should do anything to
upset the Republican nominee. This notion that the political
world swirls around two galaxies only, Republican and Democrat
only, and anybody else who enters that fray is going to affect
the other two and that's bad - that's a very myopic notion."
</P>
<P>
That's classic Barr, from the slightly withering "bless their
hearts" to the almost reflexively Republican use of "Democrat" as
an adjective. (Also on the wall of the onetime House Manager: A
framed display - including photos and gallery tickets -
commemorating President Bill Clinton's impeachment trial.)
</P>
<P>
But he also sounds - and behaves - like a man with more than just
a notion about running for president.
</P>
<P>
There's the impressive Web site that went live seemingly while
Barr was still having a parking stub validated. And the growing
public appearance schedule that this week has taken him into
Yankee territory and out of strictly Libertarian settings, like
Thursday's speech at The College of New Jersey. And the
soundbite-ready argument - "Inside every American beats the heart
of a Libertarian" - that he's the real change agent in a year of
pretenders to the title.
</P>
<P>
Well, mostly pretenders. Whether Barr's decision to go exploring
now had anything to do with Ron Paul's presidential campaign all
but officially ending last month, he credits the Texas
congressman's upstart campaign with helping prepare the way.
</P>
<P>
"In my lifetime, we've not had an administration that has
presented such a clear picture of why the current system is
broken as the Bush administration, and that has changed the
dynamics of the political system this year," Barr says. "The 'Ron
Paul phenomenon,' so to speak, also illustrates that there is a
significant group of folks out there who recognize that the
Libertarian party does present to them very relevant issues of
freedom."
</P>
<P>
Ducks in a row?
</P>
<P>
What's not here - yet - are some of the more obvious outward
trappings of a presidential run.
</P>
<P>
No "Straight Drawl Express" parked outside an Atlanta-based
national campaign office, no paid full-time staff working inside.
Some experienced political hands have come on board recently as
volunteers, but the staff and offices at Liberty Strategies LLC
carry out much of the exploratory committee's work. A lot of it
is done by Derek Barr, 26, whose duties include quietly fact-
checking his father's recall of his six grandchildren's ages
during the interview.
</P>
<P>
On his reason for (possibly) running, however, no prompting is
needed: "The size and scope and power of government," Barr says
even before being asked, "I suspect will be the key to a Bob Barr
campaign."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, much of his time recently has been spent, well,
exploring.
</P>
<P>
With a dozen other candidates already announced (and six more
considering running), can he actually secure the nomination at
the Libertarian National Convention come Memorial Day weekend?
</P>
<P>
Who would work on his campaign? What would happen to his
consulting and legal clients (he's also "of counsel" to the law
firm of Edwin Marger in Jasper, Ga.) for seven months? How much
could his previous hidebound conservative positions - he drafted
the Defense of Marriage Act passed by Congress in 1996 and was an
outspoken supporter of the war on drugs - come back to haunt him
with some Libertarians?
</P>
<P>
And what price a presidential run in the YouTube Age?
</P>
<P>
"Certainly what little sphere of privacy we've been able to
recapture over the last couple of years will dissipate
immediately," said Barr, whose wife, Jeri, is chief executive
officer of the nonprofit Center for Family Resources in North
Metro-Atlanta. "Running for president is not something you do
lightly or precipitously."
</P>
<P>
Or without having all your ducks in a row first. Even if those
ducks might never, er, hatch.
</P>
<P>
Preparing for battle
</P>
<P>
Russell Verney, a volunteer adviser who'd be Barr's campaign
manager, recalled the night in 1992 when maverick Texas
billionaire Ross Perot went on "Larry King Live" and blurted out
his intention to run as an independent presidential candidate.
Within two hours, 10,000 phone calls overwhelmed the switchboard
of Perot's computer firm.
</P>
<P>
"From then on, it was playing catch-up," said Verney, who worked
on that campaign and managed Perot's 1996 run. "It was always a
campaign that was overwhelmed."
</P>
<P>
So while Barr continues to mull his options privately and
publicly - Wednesday's "Barr Blog" entry hinted ominously at
"tactics and strategies" that might be used against him, then
invoked Bob Marley as a model courageous figure - others prepare
for battle.
</P>
<P>
Verney is already pondering how many staff, volunteer
coordinators and offices the campaign would need on Day One.
Audrey Mullen of political PR firm Advocacy Ink helps set up
Barr's media appearances and collects footage for a commercial
that would be ready to run after a formal announcement.
</P>
<P>
For early donor Peniston, that announcement can't come soon
enough. Or, apparently, without an endless supply of bunting.
</P>
<P>
"I hope he does run, if only to really shake things up," said
Peniston, a self-described independent who leans Republican.
"Unfortunately, third parties don't get involved in this till
it's nearly too late. So if he's running, he's got to keep
running for the next four years."
