MUMBAI, India 2008-05-16 15:34:45 UTC

<P>
Malaysian opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim said Friday he would
have enough support to topple Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad
Badawi's government by September.
</P>
<P>
Anwar told reporters that his People's Justice Party needed just
30 members to gain a simple majority in parliament. His party
controls 82 seats in the legislature.
</P>
<P>
"By our calculation, we should move before Sept. 16," he said
during his visit to Mumbai, India's financial and entertainment
capital, for a lecture series on "Human Rights Awareness."
</P>
<P>
The date is significant as his country celebrates Sept. 16 as
"Malaysia Day" -- commemorating the establishment of the
Malaysian federation in 1963 by joining the provinces of Malaya,
Singapore, Sabah and Sarawak.
</P>
<P>
Although Anwar has made such claims several times in the past,
Friday was the first time he has given a specific timeframe to
try to pull down the government.
</P>
<P>
He was ousted from government in 1998 by then-Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad in a power struggle amid accusations of
corruption and sodomy. Anwar denied the charges, which he said
were trumped up.
</P>
<P>
The sodomy charge was later overturned, but he served prison time
after being convicted of corruption.
</P>
<P>
The corruption charge prevented him from holding public office
until April 14, 2008, which meant he could not contest the March
8 general elections.
</P>
<P>
A record 82 opposition members from a three-party alliance led by
Anwar were elected to the 222-member lower house in the
elections. This shook the ruling National Front's grip on
governance for the first time in 40 years.
</P>
<P>
Anwar said last month that it won't be long before he is elected
a lawmaker in a by-election.
</P>
<P>
"We have enough numbers now. But we want the transition to be
peaceful and democratic," he said Friday.
</P>
<P>
He has said any government he forms will change Malaysia's system
of promoting majority ethnic Malays -- Anwar himself is Malay --
in government contracts, jobs and education over ethnic Chinese
and Indian Malaysians.
</P>
<P>
"Many ruling party members of parliament know that the time for
racial politics is over," said Anwar, adding that he was
confident that governing party members would defect to his side.
