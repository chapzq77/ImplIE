BEIJING, Sept. 16 (Xinhua)
</P>
<P>
South African amputee swimmer Natalie du Toit and Panaman
visually-impaired runner Said Gomez will be presented the Whang
Youn Dai Achievement Awards at Wednesday's closing ceremony of
the Beijing Paralympics, the International Paralympic Committee
(IPC) said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Du Toit and Gomez won the awards because they "have exemplified
the spirit of the Paralympians", the IPC said in a statement.
They will be each given a medal made out of 75 grams pure gold.
</P>
<P>
The first female amputee to compete in an able-bodied Olympics,
du Toit finished 16th among 25 competitors in the 10-kilometer
open-water swim last month at the Beijing Games. The 24-year-old
South African, who lost her lower left leg in a motorcycle
accident in 2001, won five gold medals at the Beijing Paralympics
to equal her haul from Athens four years ago.
</P>
<P>
Du Toit often holds charitable events raising funds for a South
African school for children with cerebral palsy and learning
disabilities called Vista Nova school.
</P>
<P>
Gomez, 42, is a five-time Paralympian. He lost his sight at a
young age and went through his father's discouragement and
punishment to take part in his first Paralympics in 1992 where he
won a gold and silver medals. The Panaman NPC was established in
2006 and prior to that, Gomez attended the Paralympics at his own
expense.
</P>
<P>
Since 1982, Gomez, who makes his living by farming, has been
coaching children able bodied and with disabilities just for love
of sports.
</P>
<P>
For the first time in his six Paralympics, Gomeze returned home
without a medal from Beijing as he failed to progress through the
first round in both his events - the 1,500m and 5,000m.
</P>
<P>
Athletes from 24 countries and regions had been nominated by the
IPC executive committee, Chefs de Mission and the press, and six
athletes made the shortlist, three each in the male and female
categories, said the IPC.
</P>
<P>
Joining Gomez in the men's pool were Supachai Koysub of Thailand
and Ron Williams of the United States. Along with du Toit,
Natalia Partyka of Poland and Cheri Blauwet of the United States
rounded the women's field.
</P>
<P>
The Whang Youn Dai Achievement Award is named after South Korean
Whang Youn Dai, who was stricken with polio at the age of three.
She contributed her life for the development of Paralympic sport
around the world.
</P>
<P>
At the 1988 Paralympic Summer Games in Seoul, the IPC recognized
her life-long contribution to the Paralympic Movement and thus
established the award. Since then, this award was presented at
every Paralympic Games to one male and one female athletes.
