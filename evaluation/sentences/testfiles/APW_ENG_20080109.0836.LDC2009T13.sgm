Palestinian hardliners stage anti-Bush protests, underscoring
split with moderates

GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip 2008-01-09 15:16:24 UTC

<P>
Thousands of Palestinian hard-liners in Gaza staged protests
against George W. Bush on Wednesday, burning Bush in effigy and
underscoring the deep political split with West Bank moderates
who welcomed the visit of the U.S. president as an important
gesture to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Supporters of the Islamic militant Hamas chanted "Death to
America," and burned U.S. and Israeli flags. A shadowy al-Qaida-
inspired group appeared in public for the first time with rifles
and rocket-propelled grenade launchers, and uttered vague threats
against U.S. targets.
</P>
<P>
Bush arrived in Israel on Wednesday for a three-day visit that
also includes a meeting in the West Bank on Thursday with
moderate Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, as well as a
pilgrimage to Jesus' traditional birth grotto in biblical
Bethlehem.
</P>
<P>
A senior Abbas aide, Yasser Abed Rabbo, said the Bush visit was
an important opportunity for the Palestinians to make their
demands heard. "By receiving Bush, we are not conceding our
rights," Abed Rabbo said, addressing critics at home. "We are
focusing on our rights before the entire world, and we will say
there will be no peace in the region, and no peace in the world
without people obtaining these rights."
</P>
<P>
However, polls indicate that the vast majority of Palestinians
are either indifferent to U.S. peace promises or deeply skeptical
a deal with Israel can be negotiated. The U.S. administration is
widely perceived in the Palestinian territories as a friend and
ally of Israel, at the expense of the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
In an arrival ceremony at Israel's Ben Gurion International
Airport, Bush appeared to confirm such perceptions, emphasizing
an U.S.-Israel alliance that he said "helps guarantee Israel's
security as a Jewish state." The Palestinians have balked at
Israel's demand that they recognize Israel as a Jewish state,
amid concerns that this would block future negotiations on the
fate of Palestinian refugees who lost their homes in the war that
surrounded Israel's establishment in 1948.
</P>
<P>
Bush also said he sees an opportunity for peace in the Holy Land.
</P>
<P>
In Hamas-ruled Gaza, about 5,000 supporters of the Islamic
militant group marched in the streets to protest the visit,
burning effigies of Bush and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert.
Some held posters showing a dog biting Bush's head, and of a
young man stepping on Bush's head with his shoe.
</P>
<P>
Mahmoud Zahar, a leading Hamas hard-liner, told Hamas radio that
"whoever holds much hope for the visit will be disappointed."
</P>
<P>
Even some Abbas supporters were critical of the U.S. leader.
</P>
<P>
Some 200 supporters allied with Abbas' Fatah movement and other
secular Palestinian factions urged Bush to abandon what they said
was his pro-Israel bias.
</P>
<P>
"We call on President Bush in his visit to adopt an equal
standard, and not to continue the biased policy in favor of the
occupation government," a senior Fatah leader in Gaza, Zakariya
al-Agha, told the marchers.
</P>
<P>
In the southern Gaza town of Khan Younis, about 20 masked
supporters of an al-Qaida-inspired group calling itself the "Army
of the Nation," displayed weapons in a first public appearance.
</P>
<P>
The men wore black robes over black pants. Some wore red
headbands with the words "death squad."
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the group, who only gave his nom de guerre, Abu
Hafs, said Bush was "not welcome" in the Palestinian territories.
"We are coming, not to Bush in Tel Aviv, but God willing to
Washington," he said.
</P>
<P>
He described members of the terror network al-Qaida as
"brothers," with similar methods and ideology, but added that
"there is no complete connection" to his group.
</P>
<P>
Abu Hafs's group has claimed responsibility for several recent
mortar and rocket attacks on Israeli border communities.
</P>
<P>
In recent months, several al-Qaida-inspired groups have emerged
in Gaza, though their actual links to the terror network, if any
exist, are murky. An almost complete closure of Gaza since the
Hamas takeover in June has driven Gazans deeper into poverty,
creating fertile ground for militant groups.
</P>
<P>
There has been intense speculation about a possible al-Qaida
presence in the Palestinian territories since the 2001 terror
attacks on New York and Washington.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian intelligence officials believe the terror network has
formed some sleeper cells in Gaza, and suspect possible al-Qaida
involvement in several spectacular attempts to assassinate
Palestinian security commanders since 2004. Israel also insists
al Qaida has put down roots in Gaza, a claim denied by Hamas.
</P>
<P>
Some Gazans the visit of Bush's predecessor, Bill Clinton, to
Gaza in 1998. At the time, peace hopes ran high, and Clinton was
given a hero's welcome in the coastal territory.
</P>
<P>
"We were full of joy and hope on that day (of Clinton's visit),"
said Shawki Abdel Rahman, 59, a retired teacher, who watched
Bush's arrival on a large-screen TV in a Gaza electronics store.
</P>
<P>
"Today, it's the opposite," he said. "There is no peace and no
joy over this visit."
