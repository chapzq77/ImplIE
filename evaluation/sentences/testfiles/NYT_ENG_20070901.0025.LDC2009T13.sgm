WOLF TO UNDERGO SHOULDER SURGERY

<P>
Dodgers pitcher Randy Wolf's last-ditch effort to return from the
disabled list before the end of the season has been snuffed out
by another setback.
</P>
<P>
The left-hander felt more discomfort in his shoulder this week
and will undergo arthroscopic surgery Wednesday at the Kerlan-
Jobe clinic to determine the cause.
</P>
<P>
The development casts Wolf's future into doubt, especially given
that he spurned a handful of multi-year offers last winter to
accept a one-year contract with his hometown Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, I took a huge risk to come here," Wolf said. "I knew
it was a risk, but I took a gamble, and I lost. Life is full of
them."
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers hold a $9 million option on Wolf for next season that
they clearly aren't going to exercise, which will leave him in
the unenviable position of being a free agent after a season in
which injury prevented him from pitching after the All-Star
break.
</P>
<P>
But Wolf also is a veteran lefty with a proven track record, so
there is a strong chance some team -- perhaps even the Dodgers --
will take a chance on him at a much lower price.
</P>
<P>
"I really have no idea," Wolf said. "I'm in unchartered waters."
</P>
<P>
Wolf had reconstructive elbow surgery two seasons ago, but proved
he was healthy last summer when he came back and pitched well in
12 starts for Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
But before he had that surgery, he had undergone an MRI exam that
failed to show the need for it, so for a while he tried to pitch
through his elbow discomfort.
</P>
<P>
Wolf speculated that his current shoulder injury might be the
result of a mechanical change he made to accommodate the elbow
pain before it was discovered that he would need Tommy John
surgery.
</P>
<P>
If doctors Lewis Yocum and Neal ElAttrache find the cause of
Wolf's discomfort, they will repair it immediately. But no
prognosis for Wolf's return to the mound will be known until
after the surgery.
</P>
<P>
"If it's only an impingement, which we think it is, he'll be down
six to eight weeks," Dodgers trainer Stan Conte said.
</P>
<P>
Wolf was less optimistic.
</P>
<P>
"If they find nothing, I'll be surprised," he said. "It's just
too weird. I haven't thrown (off a mound) in four weeks, and it
still isn't right. Usually you feel better after four weeks of
not throwing."
</P>
<P>
Getting close: Dodgers manager Grady Little said that although
Nomar Garciaparra (strained left calf) still hasn't felt good
enough to try running, he has looked good enough in batting
practice that he might be activated for pinch-hitting purposes as
soon as today, when active rosters can be expanded to as many as
40 players.
</P>
<P>
"He really looks good swinging the bat and fielding ground balls,
too," Little said. "But he still feels a little something in
there (running), and we don't want to push it until he feels
comfortable."
</P>
<P>
Also: Newly acquired right-hander Esteban Loaiza will make his
Dodgers debut on Monday at Chicago, with Brad Penny starting on
Tuesday night against the Cubs and the rest of the rotation
staying in order thereafter. ... Lefty Eric Stults was optioned
to Triple-A Las Vegas to clear a roster spot for Loaiza, but
Stults is expected to return to the majors after the 51s' season
concludes Monday. ... The Dodgers are expected to promote some
players from Las Vegas today and some more on Monday. If Double-A
Jacksonville reaches the Southern Leaue playoffs, none of the
Suns' players will be promoted until their season ends.
