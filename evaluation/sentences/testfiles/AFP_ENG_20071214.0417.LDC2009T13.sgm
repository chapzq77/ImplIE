Football: Mixed emotions as England prepare for Italian job
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fabio Capello's impending appointment as the new England manager
evoked mixed emotions Friday as the stark reality of the
country's lack of home-grown candidates hit home.England's
Football Assocation (FA) on Thursday approved Capello's
appointment for a post which has been vacant since Steve McClaren
was sacked in the wake of England's failure to qualify for 2008.
</P>
<P>
Capello, who won nine league titles in 15 seasons with four
different clubs in Italy and Spain, is expected to be confirmed
in the post Friday once negotiations over terms and the
appointment of back room staff have concluded.
</P>
<P>
However the FA's choise to name the no-nonsense Italian has
prompted mixed emotions.
</P>
<P>
Former England captain Paul Ince said Capello's impending
appointment is a "sad indictment of English football".
</P>
<P>
And Ince, now the manager at League Two side MK Dons, believes
the job should have gone to an Englishman.
</P>
<P>
"It's a sad indictment on English football that we've got to go
to Europe for a manager," Ince told Saturday's Football Focus
programme according to the BBC.
</P>
<P>
"We have got enough managers in England who could do just as good
a job."
</P>
<P>
He added: "In English football we say you've got to get your
qualifications, you've got to do this, you've got to get that.
</P>
<P>
"But when you build your CV up and they go out and get a foreign
manager, sometimes you think, 'what's the point?'"
</P>
<P>
The 40-year-old added: "In time we're going to get to the stage -
whether it's two years, three or four years - that Fabio might go
and we've got to have a ready-made replacement for him and it's
got to be English."
</P>
<P>
Capello is set to become the richest coach in international
football when he signs a reported 6.5 million pounds (13 million
dollars) a year contract, a deal that will see him earn four
million annually after tax.
</P>
<P>
The size of the salary, compared to the 2.5 million pounds a year
deal that McClaren was handed last year, is an indication of the
FA's determination to sign a 'world-class' coach after the
failure to qualify for Euro 2008 cost them at least 12 million
pounds, and probably considerably more in terms of damage to the
England brand.
</P>
<P>
Despite the 61-year-old Capello expressing a desire to have
English coaches as part of his set-up, he is expected to bring
three or four fellow Italians with him for his coaching staff,
including his trusted aide Franco Baldini as his assistant.
</P>
<P>
That move has reportedly rankled with some, but others believe
that Capello must be employed on his own terms or not at all.
</P>
<P>
"It's simple. If you employ Fabio Capello, you give him what he
wants," said former player Tony Cascarino, writing in The Times.
</P>
<P>
"You are buying into his winning formula, and you are doing it
wholesale, not picking and choosing the bits that you like.
</P>
<P>
"You do not hand a man the keys to his new Ferrari then tie one
hand behind his back."
</P>
<P>
Another former England player, Tony Adams, said he was a huge
admirer of Capello's, having visited the Italian at Juventus to
get a sneak view at some of his coaching methods.
</P>
<P>
But Adams, now working under Harry Redknapp at Portsmouth,
reiterated Ince's view.
</P>
<P>
"I've got no argument with Capello's CV, it's a fantastic CV. I'm
a massive admirer of his but I still wouldn't have had him as
England manager because I just wanted an Englishman to take this
country forward."
