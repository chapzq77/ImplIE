HAWKS SEE AN OPENING, THE CELTICS A LIFELINE

ATLANTA
</P>
<P>
For five years, ever since a rebuilding project started with
General Manager Billy Knight in 2003, Atlanta Hawks fans have
resented failed draft picks (Shelden Williams), the refusal to
draft a top-shelf point guard (Chris Paul, Deron Williams), the
signing of the swingman Joe Johnson to a five-year, $70 million
contract, and the squabbling over finances by a cadre of 10
owners.
</P>
<P>
So when the Hawks were thumped in the first two games of a best-
of-seven Eastern Conference series by the Boston Celtics, a
collapse of the Hawks' rebuilding project did not seem far away.
Mike Woodson, the coach, was already in jeopardy of losing his
job. Given the ease with which the Celtics sliced up the Hawks,
it seemed very likely that the roster would be examined closely.
</P>
<P>
But the Hawks have had the last word against the doomsayers.
Atlanta suddenly looks like a promising franchise because it has
taken the Celtics, who had the NBA's best record this season, to
Game 7 on Sunday in Boston.
</P>
<P>
"When you make the playoffs, you are not guaranteed to play in it
the next year and the year after, so when you get an opportunity
to play in it, you better try to make the best of it," Woodson
said.
</P>
<P>
The Hawks gathered around Woodson after a one-hour walk-through
here Saturday afternoon. He sounded delighted with his upstart
team, the third youngest in the league.
</P>
<P>
"You have made it a one-game series," Woodson told his players.
"You have a chance to do something special."
</P>
<P>
The Celtics are trying to avoid the embarrassment of becoming the
fourth No. 1 seed to lose to a No. 8 seed in the playoffs. They
were 66-16 in the regular season, but they have seemed old in
several games against the Hawks.
</P>
<P>
Johnson, who has emerged as an All-Star, said he watched the
Celtics bending over, clutching their shorts, in the fourth
quarter of the Hawks' 103-100 victory Friday night at Philips
Arena. Johnson said that Kevin Garnett and Kendrick Perkins, in
particular, seemed tired, especially on pick and rolls.
</P>
<P>
"They weren't coming as fast," Johnson said. "Sometimes, they
weren't coming at all."
</P>
<P>
The Celtics have won all three games of the series that have been
played at TD Banknorth Garden. The victories have been
convincing, by an average of 22 points. The Celtics seem to play
with more energy at home, and the Hawks have not figured out how
to combat Boston's pressure when the Celtics are playing on their
own court.
</P>
<P>
"We feel good at home all the time," said Doc Rivers, Boston's
coach. "That's why we fought all year to get home-court
advantage. As I said after Game 5, we can't just hang our hat on
being at home."
</P>
<P>
Atlanta is shooting 47.6 percent from the field at Philips Arena,
but only 39 percent in Boston. The Hawks have turned the ball
over 94 times, compared with only 66 turnovers for the Celtics.
</P>
<P>
The health of the 6-foot-9 forward Marvin Williams, who has been
assigned to guard the Celtics' Paul Pierce, may be a more-
pressing issue for the Hawks.
</P>
<P>
Williams sprained his left knee in the second half of Game 6 on
Friday night. He limped through Saturday's walk-through with the
knee heavily bandaged, and the Hawks listed him as doubtful for
Sunday's game, although Woodson said, "My gut says he'll play."
</P>
<P>
The Hawks have been able to win because players other than
Johnson -- Williams, for example -- have established themselves
in the series. Johnson, who scored 35 points in Atlanta's Game 4
win, had only 7 points through three quarters in Game 6 because
of the Celtics' relentless double teams. The Hawks responded by
sharing the scoring responsibilities, and six players finished in
double figures.
</P>
<P>
When the Hawks tried to spread the floor to eliminate the double
teams, the Celtics rushed two players at Johnson at halfcourt,
only to have him relieve the pressure by passing to Al Horford at
the top of the key. Horford then turned to the basket with a
three-on-two advantage. The Hawks routinely attacked the basket
and went to the free-throw line 15 times in the fourth quarter;
the Celtics shot only two free throws in the period.
</P>
<P>
The Celtics want to regroup and show the same strong defense they
displayed during the regular season. Boston gave up 90.29 points
a game; only Detroit had a better average.
</P>
<P>
"It's either win or go home," Celtics guard Rajon Rondo said.
"We've just got to go out there and get the job done."
