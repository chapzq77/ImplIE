EURO 2008: Sweden coach Lagerback ranks experience above youth in
fifth consecutive championship
</HEADLINE>

STOCKHOLM, Sweden 2008-05-11 13:06:27 UTC

<P>
Don't expect any promising teenagers to break into Sweden's squad
for the European Championship.
</P>
<P>
Lars Lagerback, the only coach ever to bring Sweden to five
consecutive major championships, prefers experience over youth,
and he will choose which players will head to Austria and
Switzerland next month along those lines.
</P>
<P>
"Top-level football today is incredibly demanding, so I don't
think it's possible to go from nowhere into the national team,"
the 59-year-old Lagerback said. "I don't understand how you can
select a player who is 17 years old. What's the motivation for
that?"
</P>
<P>
Lagerback was referring to former England coach Sven-Goran
Eriksson, a fellow Swede, who called up Theo Walcott for the 2006
World Cup when he was only 17.
</P>
<P>
Spain, one of Sweden's rivals in Group D, has also left the door
open to talented youngsters, with 20-year-old Cesc Fabregas and
22-year-old Sergio Ramos entering the squad when they were still
in their teens.
</P>
<P>
Lagerback's philosophy, however, is to stack the bench with
seasoned players he knows can handle the pressure of
international competition "in case the squad is hit by a stomach
bug, or four players get injured or sick."
</P>
<P>
Ten veterans older than 30, including 36-year-old midfielder
Niclas Alexandersson and 34-year-old striker Marcus Allback, are
likely to be picked.
</P>
<P>
If former Celtic and FC Barcelona striker Henrik Larsson hadn't
retired from the national team two years ago, the 36-yearold
Swede would also probably still be in the squad.
</P>
<P>
Lagerback has been criticized for not making room for more up-
and-coming youngsters such as 19-year-old Sebastian Rajalakso,
who scored five goals in his first five matches for Djurgarden
this season.
</P>
<P>
But it takes more than one successful season in the domestic
Allsvenskan league to impress Lagerback, who usually wants
players to prove themselves in bigger European leagues.
</P>
<P>
"He wants you to be ready before you get the chance," said 30
-year-old midfielder Daniel Andersson, who has made regular
appearances for Sweden since 2000, though mostly as a substitute.
</P>
<P>
"It's a big step from Allsvenskan to play in the national team,"
Andersson added. "If you're playing in La Liga, Premier League or
Serie A, then you're already on a high level."
</P>
<P>
Lagerback may be a master tactician, but he's no gambler. He
believes "continuity" has been the key to Sweden's success since
he took charge in 2000, first as co-coach with Tommy Soderberg,
and since Euro 2004 as the sole commander, flanked by assistant
coach Roland Andersson.
</P>
<P>
Together they have molded a highly efficient team, where each
player has a clear role and knows exactly what's expected of him.
</P>
<P>
The downside is, so do the opponents.
</P>
<P>
Anyone facing Sweden in a competitive match in the past few years
could count on roughly the same formation: Zlatan Ibrahimovic
spearheading the attack, Fredrik Ljungberg and Christian
Wilhemsson foraying down the flanks, and workhorse Tobias
Linderoth in a defensive midfield role.
</P>
<P>
"We've been able to work all these years with a fundamental style
of play. That makes it easier to bring in new players," Lagerback
said. "They gradually learn their roles and others' roles very
well. So I think continuity is a success factor."
</P>
<P>
Sweden has qualified for three European Championships and two
World Cups under Lagerback's leadership. After being ousted in
the group stage of Euro 2000, Sweden advanced to the second round
in the following competitions.
</P>
<P>
That's no small feat for a country outside of Europe's
traditional soccer elite.
</P>
<P>
Still, many Swedes have criticized Lagerback for the nation's
lack of success in the knockout stages. The Swedes lost to the
Netherlands on penalties in Euro 2004 quarterfinals, and exited
the last two World Cups in the round of 16 -- in extra time
against Senegal in 2002 and after a 2-0 loss to host Germany in
2006.
</P>
<P>
Lagerback doesn't think he could have done much differently.
</P>
<P>
"Take Holland and Senegal. We hit the post. That's how close we
were to winning in extra time," he said.
</P>
<P>
Besides Spain, Sweden faces Russia and defending champion Greece
in Group D.
</P>
<P>
Lagerback, whose contract expires in 2010, believes Sweden can
beat any opponent on a good day, but admits that it lacks the
depth of talent found in the bigger European teams.
</P>
<P>
"We're very dependent on including our six, seven best players,"
he said, noting that his team risks to "overburden our best
players in the group stage in order to advance."
</P>
<P>
"But I also think it's about skill level," Lagerback added. "We
have to improve one notch to take another step from the
quarterfinals."
