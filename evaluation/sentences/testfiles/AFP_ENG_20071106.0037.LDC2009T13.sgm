US starts reviewing aid to Pakistan
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The United States said Tuesday it has begun studying whether to
suspend any of its multi-billion-dollar aid program to Pakistan
as it again pressed President Pervez Musharraf to end emergency
rule.
</P>
<P>
"People started work on it," State Department spokesman Sean
McCormack told reporters, referring to the review that had been
promised since Musharraf declared emergency rule in his country
on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The review involving the State Department and other government
agencies as well as the White House would look at whether
Pakistan had violated any US laws or rules that would require
Washington to suspend aid, he said.
</P>
<P>
US officials said Washington has contributed 9.6 billion dollars
in military and economic development aid to Pakistan since it
became a key US ally in the US war against terrorism following
the attacks on September 11, 2001.
</P>
<P>
Another 780 million dollars is due this year.
</P>
<P>
McCormack said the US government had to weigh its legal
obligations against ensuring that it continued to bolster
Pakistan in its battles against Islamist militants hiding along
its border with Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think anybody expects that the president or the
government is going to take a step that might make the United
States less safe or might diminish our capabilities to fight
terror," McCormack said.
</P>
<P>
"That said, there are potentially certain requirements under the
law. We're going to look at what is required and what is
triggered by the law," he said.
</P>
<P>
McCormack said the US aim was to press nuclear-armed Pakistan to
resume its path toward democracy in the interest of Pakistanis,
their neighbors and the world at large.
</P>
<P>
He added that "robust democratic institutions" will in the long
term "be Pakistan's best defense against the violent
extremists..."
</P>
<P>
The White House meanwhile expressed broad support for "freedom of
expression" and assembly in Pakistan but stopped well short of
encouraging demonstrations against Musharraf.
</P>
<P>
And leading US lawmakers upped the ante.
</P>
<P>
Democratic Senator Joseph Biden, chairman of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee, said Tuesday he had a "frank" telephone
conversation with Musharraf.
</P>
<P>
"I told President Musharraf how critical it is for relations
between our two countries that elections go forward as planned in
January, that he follow through on his commitment to take off his
uniform and that he restore the rule of law to Pakistan," he said
in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"It is clear to me from our conversation that President Musharraf
understands the consequences for his country and for relations
with the United States if he does not return Pakistan to the path
of democracy," he added.
</P>
<P>
Democratic Senator Patrick Leahy, who oversees aid to Pakistan as
chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on State and Foreign
Operations, said Washington should have supported the "moderate
majority" rather than Musharraf, who has not fulfilled pledges on
democracy since seizing power in a 1999 coup.
</P>
<P>
"The United States will continue its support to the Pakistani
people," Leahy said in a statement posted on his website on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
"But US aid to the Musharraf government should stop until
constitutional order, civil liberties and judicial independence
are restored, until political prisoners are released, and until
free and fair elections are allowed," he said.c
