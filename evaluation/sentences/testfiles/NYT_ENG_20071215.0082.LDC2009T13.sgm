FRUSTRATION WITH CHARITIES AND U.N. GROWS IN CONGO
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GOMA, Congo
</P>
<P>
Frustration at the U.N. peacekeeping force and the dozens of aid
organizations working in North Kivu province, in eastern Congo,
is rising as violence increases, the number of displaced people
here creeps toward 1 million, and the pace of assistance,
especially to those fleeing the fighting in the past few weeks,
lags.
</P>
<P>
Many Congolese want the U.N. peacekeepers to intervene more
forcefully and fight beside the Congolese army against the rebel
forces of Laurent Nkunda, a renegade general who refuses to merge
his troops into the national armed forces.
</P>
<P>
The fight against Nkunda has pushed Congo to the brink of a new
civil war, a year after the first elected government in four
decades took office and four years after fighting officially
ended. Congo's army has proved unable to beat back the rebels,
and the fighting in the past year has displaced 425,000 people.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. force has a strong mandate in Congo to use force to
protect civilians, and it has pledged to defend Goma and the
camps around it from being overrun by rebels. It is also required
to work with the Congolese army to establish security, which has
led to the expectation in a population weary from more than a
decade of conflict that the U.N. force here, known by its
acronym, MONUC, would help defeat the rebels.
</P>
<P>
"Why is MONUC here, if not to fight these people who make us
suffer?" said Mwenge Biroto, who fled Sake on Tuesday. "Why don't
they help us get peace?"
</P>
<P>
Diplomats from several Western countries have also questioned why
MONUC has not acted more forcefully to prevent civilians from
having to flee in the first place, an issue that is likely to
come up as diplomats gather here this weekend to discuss regional
security. The force's mandate is up for renewal in the Security
Council this month.
</P>
<P>
U.N. officials say that their role is to help the Congo's
government, not take its place, and that protecting civilians is
mainly the government's responsibility. The United Nations has
provided transportation for troop movements and some helicopter
air support to the government's unsuccessful efforts to remove
Nkunda.
</P>
<P>
Congolese frustration with the U.N. force is more than matched by
anger at its own military, which retreated in the face of rebel
attacks last week.
</P>
<P>
Brig. Gen. Indrajeet Narayan, the commander of the 4,500
peacekeeping troops deployed in North Kivu, said the force was
not authorized to go any further unless it was under attack.
"There is a lot of expectation" from civilians, Narayan said.
"They see our troops, they see our weaponry, so they expect this
should be used. However, the mandate clearly sates that we have
to protect the civilian population; that is foremost."
</P>
<P>
The United Nations also has serious human rights concerns in
working too closely with the Congolese military, which has
struggled, largely unsuccessfully, to maintain discipline and
morale. The army is mostly composed of former members of the old
national army and militias who fought in the civil war. They have
been retrained and redeployed, but problems have continued, and
the army has been accused of many human rights violations,
including murder and rape.
</P>
<P>
Human rights organizations and aid workers say that the army
sometimes collaborates with militias, like the Mai Mai. Last
week, the 14th Brigade, which the rebels chased out of Mushake,
harassed civilians and looted as it left, drawing censure from
the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Many Congolese are also frustrated with aid organizations, many
of which began to scale back emergency programs after last year's
election to focus more on long-and medium-term development, the
brick-and-mortar projects, like schools, clinics and water
systems, needed to rebuild a shattered country. They are
struggling to keep up with the surge in demand for basic
supplies, like food and shelter, for the endless river of
displaced people, and work amid the violence.
</P>
<P>
Hunger and disease, not bullets and bombs, have always been the
primary killers in Congo, where some researchers estimate 4
million have died since the war began in 1996. People on the run
often crowd in with relatives in provincial towns to avoid the
refugee camps. But this practice can make them more vulnerable to
disease -- most camps have clean water and latrines.
</P>
<P>
In Rutshuru, a large regional town, a cholera epidemic brings 50
people daily to a hospital run by Doctors Without Borders.
Cholera is a grim byproduct of displacement. When rural people
flock to cities, they take cholera with them. In crowded and
unsanitary conditions, it spreads like wildfire, said Augustin
Augier, the hospital's coordinator.
</P>
<P>
"The violence and disease are completely connected," Augier said.
"We have never seen a cholera epidemic in Rutshuru; it is only as
a result of the crisis."
</P>
<P>
The hospital set up a cholera ward, and a workshop to build cots.
Speed is essential. Caught early, cholera is treatable -- no
medicine is needed, just copious infusions of intravenous fluids.
But left untreated, it kills half of its victims, sometimes in a
day.
</P>
<P>
Getting food to the displaced has been a problem, in part because
they move so quickly, often outpacing lumbering aid
bureaucracies. Security concerns and rutted, mud-choked roads
have made it difficult to move supplies. Recent clashes forced
the World Food Program to suspend deliveries to areas where more
than 350,000 displaced people lived.
</P>
<P>
Even when populations can return, they cannot farm because of
roaming armed groups. Rebels and army soldiers alike, aid and
human rights workers say, rape women who leave their villages to
farm. Child malnutrition is rising, and displaced people are
forced to flee with no food, leaving them dependent on handouts.
</P>
<P>
In Minova, a town where dozens of ragged, exhausted families
arrived last week seeking refuge, Cadre, a local aid
organization, opened a spare building where it usually offers
sewing classes as a shelter from the driving rain.
</P>
<P>
"We really don't have anything to offer them -- no food, nothing
to make shelter," said Edouard Dunia, who leads Cadre.
</P>
<P>
Eugenie Hasima sat on a hill nearby, trying to calm her daughter
Ajira, 2, who screeched for food. "I have nothing to give her,"
she said, breaking down in sobs as Ajira cried inconsolably. "She
has not eaten since yesterday, and she spent all day walking. We
are all just so hungry."
