A 6.4-magnitude earthquake rattled a mountainous region in
southwest China at dawn Sunday, killing three people and injuring
about 300, state media and officials said.
</P>
<P>
Residents in Pu'er, the centre of a famous tea-producing area in
Yunnan province, fled their houses in panic when the tremor
struck at 5:34 am (2134 GMT), the Xinhua news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
A five-year-old boy was crushed to death when his family's home
collapsed, state television said. His parents were taken to
hospital but were deemed out of danger.
</P>
<P>
Local authorities reported more than 290 people injured by mid-
afternoon, Xinhua said. The agency earlier said that 15 had
sustained serious injuries.
</P>
<P>
"We're still compiling data on the casualties and on material
damage," a local civil affairs official told China News Service.
"The numbers will definitely go up."
</P>
<P>
Authorities ordered the evacuation of thousands of people in the
tremor-prone region near the border with Laos and Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
In Beijing, Cabinet leaders including Premier Wen Jiabao and Vice
Premier Hui Liangyu ordered the establishment of a special
emergency task force to deal with the aftermath of the disaster.
</P>
<P>
Aftershocks continuously rattled the area, one with a magnitude
of 5.1, prompting Pu'er officials to issue a warning to
residents, the China News Service said.
</P>
<P>
Roads were severely damaged in the quake and water and power
supplies to the area were cut off, Xinhua said.
</P>
<P>
Telecommunications systems were also disturbed, making it
difficult to assess the situation on the ground, it said.
</P>
<P>
The agency cited preliminary estimates that material damage
totalled about one billion yuan (130 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
Xinhua said some houses had collapsed and the government was
sending 7,000 tents to the zone, suggesting the damage was
relatively severe.
</P>
<P>
"We estimate 120,000 people will have to be evacuated," an
official at the civil affairs bureau in Ning'er county, where the
disaster happened, told AFP. Like many Chinese officials, he gave
only his surname, Li.
</P>
<P>
Li said 20,000 locals had been mobilised to take part in the
rescue work, while Xinhua also said authorities had dispatched
more than 50 rescue workers to the affected area.
</P>
<P>
Military in the region had also been sent to the disaster zone,
including 3,000 members of armed border units, reports said.
</P>
<P>
The US Geological Survey said the quake struck at a depth of 10
kilometres (six miles).
</P>
<P>
The remote area has previously been the scene of several
devastating earthquakes.
</P>
<P>
The worst in recent memory, with a magnitude of 7.6, happened in
1988, killing 748 people and injuring 3,759, according to
official data.
</P>
<P>
A seismological department official in Yangon said there were no
reports of any damage or injuries in Myanmar. The region
bordering China is mountainous and sparsely populated.
</P>
<P>
China is located in one of the most seismologically unstable
areas of the world.
</P>
<P>
In December, a powerful earthquake in waters off the Chinese
mainland damaged undersea cables, disturbing Internet traffic for
weeks.
