SOUTH KOREAN PARLIAMENT TO INVESTIGATE CANDIDATE
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, South Korea
</P>
<P>
What had appeared to be a one-horse race for the presidential
election in South Korea on Wednesday turned less predictable on
Monday when Parliament voted to open an independent investigation
into allegations of fraud against Lee Myung-bak, the front-runner
and candidate of the opposition Grand National Party.
</P>
<P>
Polling experts predicted that the vote to open the investigation
was unlikely to derail the conservative politician's ride to
victory. But they said the problem highlighted a question facing
voters, many of whom are still undecided -- which is more
important in a president: high ethical standards or an ability to
manage the economy?
</P>
<P>
It is a question that South Koreans will grapple with long after
the election.
</P>
<P>
Even if Lee wins, he will have undergone the humiliation of being
the first South Korean president-elect to face a criminal
investigation, and a possible indictment.
</P>
<P>
The parliamentary move came a day after a video surfaced of a
university lecture Lee gave in 2000, in which he appears to be
claiming he founded an investment company that is now at the
center of stock manipulation charges.
</P>
<P>
Lee has denied any involvement with the company, BBK. On Monday,
he said that he had made "some incorrect statements" in the
lecture. Denying again that he established the company, he said
he had "not a speck of guilt concerning BBK."
</P>
<P>
"In this election, our nation will decide whether to take a leap
forward or stay where we are," Lee said in a televised campaign
speech on Monday. "We should move from the negative politics of
slandering each other to the positive politics of embracing each
other."
</P>
<P>
Lee, who turns 66 on Wednesday, has been hounded by questions
about his ethics. But South Koreans have rallied behind him --
some tired of the two successive liberal governments and others
on a belief that Lee, a former star executive at Hyundai, one of
South Korea's best known conglomerates, could help revive the
economy.
</P>
<P>
In the last opinion polls, released Thursday, Lee was pulling
ahead with an almost 30 percentage-point lead over his closest
rival. By law, no survey results can be published in the final
week of campaigning.
</P>
<P>
Polling experts said that although the video highlighted Lee's
vulnerabilities, it may have come too late to reverse the outcome
of the race. However, they said it appeared unlikely that Lee
would win with a majority of the vote.
</P>
<P>
"It's mind-boggling to imagine what will happen if the special
prosecutor finds Mr. Lee guilty and indicts him," said Kim Neung
Gou, head of Wincom Communication, a political consultancy in
Seoul. "Even if he is cleared legally, the damage to his moral
authority will dog him as long as he stays in office."
</P>
<P>
South Korea has never seen anything like Lee's situation. Legal
experts remain divided as to whether a president can stand trial
on charges filed while he is president-elect. Under the South
Korean Constitution, a sitting president is immune from
prosecution unless he is charged with treason.
</P>
<P>
Under the bill passed by the National Assembly on Monday, the
independent prosecutor must complete his investigation within 40
days, or, in other words, before the winner of the election on
Wednesday takes office on Feb. 25.
</P>
<P>
For days, rival legislators chanting "Lee Myung-bak for
president!" or "Lee Myung-bak, liar!" had been trading blows
during the parliamentary debate over the bill.
</P>
<P>
The independent prosecutor will investigate whether Lee set up
BBK and was the mastermind behind stock manipulation and
embezzlement by a Korean-American businessman named Kim Kyung
Joon.
</P>
<P>
This month, state prosecutors indicted Kim but cleared Lee,
boosting Lee's popularity in opinion polls. But in the same
surveys, a majority of respondents said they were dissatisfied
with the prosecutors' report.
</P>
<P>
"Voting for Lee is the same as voting for a lie," said Chung
Dong-young, the main pro-government liberal candidate running a
distant second in recent opinion polls. He called Lee "a second
Nixon and a second Thaksin," referring to the former American and
Thai leaders who were forced out of office.
</P>
<P>
Chung predicted that South Korea would face a "likely re-
election" if Lee wins the poll Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
For many, Lee epitomizes the country's proud rags-to-riches rise
from the ashes of the Korean War to become the world's 13th-
largest economy. A son of a family too poor to send him to
college, Lee ran away to Seoul and finished college while working
as a garbage collector.
</P>
<P>
From an unheard-of age of 36, he led six affiliates of Hyundai,
which became the country's largest conglomerate and icon of its
rapid industrialization during his tenure.
</P>
<P>
But Lee also reminded people of another side of some of their
country's big-business executives, whose success people suspect
was built partly on corruption. Lee recently apologized for using
false addresses in the 1980s in order to enroll his children in
better schools and for putting two of them on the payroll of his
company, even though at least one of them never worked there.
</P>
<P>
Still, many voters are supporting Lee as a reaction against the
incumbent President Roh Moo-hyun, experts said. Although Roh is
largely considered ethically cleaner than his predecessor, he has
irritated people by focusing on issues like how to deal with
North Korea, while most people were more preoccupied with soaring
housing prices. Meanwhile, Lee, who was mayor of Seoul from 2002
to 2006, built his pragmatic image with improvements like
renovating city parks and easing traffic jams.
