Football: Injury worries won't force Strachan to buy by Alistair

Celtic manager Gordon Strachan says he won't be rushed into
making any moves in the transfer market despite the threat of
being without his two top-scorers from last season for next
week's Old Firm match.Scott McDonald, who bagged 31 goals in his
first season after joining from Motherwell, missed Celtic's 3-0
weekend victory against Falkirk with a groin strain.
</P>
<P>
The Australian striker is a doubt for next week's derby match
against Rangers, with the sides level at the top of the Scottish
Premier League after three games.
</P>
<P>
Strike partner Jan Vennegoor of Hesselink was stretchered off
during the match against Falkirk after receiving a deep cut to
his lower leg following a clash with Lee Bullen.
</P>
<P>
The pair, who struck 51 goals between them last season, would be
a major loss for the champions for their match against their
arch-rivals.
</P>
<P>
But Strachan says he doesn't feel under pressure to buy new
strikers as his side managed to score three without them against
Falkirk.
</P>
<P>
He said: "We're not really looking to bring in new players but we
might do if there is something that is a good deal.
</P>
<P>
"We are always looking for good deals and good players.
</P>
<P>
"But we had McDonald and Hesselink playing the last few games and
they only scored one and they didn't play against Falkirk and we
scored three."
</P>
<P>
And the Hoops gaffer said they would give 24-year-old McDonald
every chance of making the Old Firm match after his withdrawal
from the squad for the Falkirk match.
</P>
<P>
"His injury came as a surprise to us as he trained on Friday
morning. I thought there was something wrong with his ankle but
it's his abductor muscle so we've got to have a look at that,"
Strachan added.
</P>
<P>
"He might be fit for next week. We'll see how he reacts in the
first couple of days as he's a strong lad.
</P>
<P>
"Jan's got a bad gash on his leg. We just need to see if there is
any bone or ligament damage and we should know about that in the
next few days."
</P>
<P>
On Saturday Celtic cruised to a comfortable 3-0 win at Parkhead
to send them top of the SPL.
</P>
<P>
Shaun Maloney made his return at Celtic as a first-half
substitute and he had a hand in all three goals.
</P>
<P>
The diminutive forward, on for the injured Jan Vennegoor of
Hesselink, won a controversial free-kick on the right following a
soft foul after 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
Shunsuke Nakamura floated the free-kick into the box and McManus'
header found its way into the net despite Robert Olejnik getting
a hand to it.
</P>
<P>
Celtic increased their lead in the 44th minute and Maloney was
involved again.
</P>
<P>
He played a beautifully threaded through ball to Greek striker
Georgios Samaras who rounded the keeper and rolled the ball into
the net.
</P>
<P>
Maloney should have marked his Parkhead return with a goal in the
54th minute when he broke clear into the box but his effort was
wide.
</P>
<P>
Falkirk's Mark Stewart had a chance in the 60th minute after
Michael Higdon rolled the ball to him at the edge of the box but
his weak effort was straight at Boruc.
</P>
<P>
Samaras scored his second of the day in the 67th minute after
good link-up play with Maloney.
</P>
<P>
He played a clever backheel into the path of Samaras, whose soft
effort found its way under Olejnik.
</P>
<P>
The final effort of the match fell to none other than Maloney but
his effort was blocked by the keeper in the 86th minute.
