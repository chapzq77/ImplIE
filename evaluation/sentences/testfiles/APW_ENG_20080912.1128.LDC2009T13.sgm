A senior U.S. diplomat said Friday that Washington would back
Ukraine in case of a territorial dispute.
</P>
<P>
Following Russia's war with Georgia last month, Ukrainian and
some Western officials have expressed concern that the ex-Soviet
republic may be targeted by neighboring Russia.
</P>
<P>
Although Russian leaders insist they recognize Ukraine's borders,
some nationalist politicians have suggested that Russia should
regain control of Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula, a jewel of the
Russian empire and home to a key Russian naval base.

U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Daniel Fried vowed Friday that
Washington would back Ukraine in case of a territorial dispute.
</P>
<P>
"The United States and I daresay Europe as well support Ukraine's
independence, its freedom, its democracy, its right to chose its
own future," Fried told reporters after a meeting with his
Ukrainian counterpart.
</P>
<P>
"Our support for Ukraine has only increased as the result of
pressure and will only increase if there is pressure from other
places," Fried said. "I hope that no one puts Ukraine's
territorial integrity into question."

Crimea and its Black Sea Port of Sevaspotol were long the pride
of the Russian empire. But in 1954, Soviet leader Nikita
Khrushchev, who had previously served as Ukraine's Communist
Party boss, made the peninsula part of Soviet Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
After the 1991 Soviet breakup the Crimean Peninsula remained part
of the independent Ukraine. Russia has a lease agreement to rent
the Sevastopol naval base until 2017 and has made it clear it is
reluctant to go.
