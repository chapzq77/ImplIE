UN-backed court fails to prove Rwanda genocide planned: analysts
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The acquittal of Rwanda's ex-army colonel Theoneste Bagosora by
the UN war crimes tribunal of conspiracy to commit genocide marks
the court's failure to prove the massacre was planned, analysts
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Bagosora, jailed for life by the International Criminal Tribunal
for Rwanda (ICTR) Thursday, had been accused by prosecutors of
being the "brains" behind the 1994 genocide when some 800,000
people were killed in a 100-day spree.
</P>
<P>
The former Rwandan defence ministry chief of staff was sentenced
alongside two co-defendants of "genocide, crimes against humanity
and war crimes," but acquitted of conspiring to commit genocide
before April 7, 1994.
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, the court upheld that Bagosora, 67, was the Rwanda's
de facto army chief after the April 6, 1994 downing of a plane
carrying then president Juvenal Habyarimana, an act believed to
have triggered the genocide.
</P>
<P>
To date no suspect has ever been convicted by the Tanzania-based
ICTR on conspiracy accusation despite charging nearly all the
suspects with the crime.
</P>
<P>
"This means that nobody organised the genocide, that it would be
a crime without a perpetrator and without premeditation," said
Filip Reyntjens, a lecturer at Belgium's Anvers university and an
expert prosecution witness in Bagosora's case.
</P>
<P>
"Thus the genocide was spontaneous. This is very worrying,"
Reyntjens told AFP.
</P>
<P>
For Andre Guichaoua, also an expert ICTR witness, "to dare say
with humility that there is no sufficient evidence in Bagosora's
case to prove conspiracy is a ruling with huge consequences,
moreso politically."
</P>
<P>
However, the court ruled that some of the accused had a role in
the formation of militia, distribution of arms and compiling
lists of those suspected to be close to then Tutsi-led Rwandan
Patriotic Front (RPF) rebels or those opposed to the government
of the day.
</P>
<P>
But it did not establish whether the activities were aimed at
killing Tusti civilians with the aim of committing genocide,
according to court documents.
</P>
<P>
ICTR chief prosecutor Hassan Bubacar Jallow charged that Bagosora
and three other ex-army officers, one of whom was cleared of all
charges, were involved in a conspiracy that began in late 1990
when hundreds of Tutsis were arrested after an attack by the RPF.
</P>
<P>
The conspiracy became more explicit the following year when the
accused, part of a 10-member panel formed by Habyarimana, worked
towards the "definition of the enemy", Jallow argued.
</P>
<P>
The panel met to explore ways of "defeating the enemy militarily,
politically and through the media," with the enemy being the
Tutsis.
</P>
<P>
"ICTR's failure is not wholesome. A senior figure was tried and
convicted on Thursday. But even then, despite all the resources
at its desposal, the ICTR has not decoded the planning of the
genocide. This is sad," Reyntjens said.
</P>
<P>
There is a "lack of will by the tribunal ... which did not
accomplish its task to the end," said Guichaoua.
</P>
<P>
"To me Bagosora was delegated to, he was not in control,"
Guichaoua explained.
</P>
<P>
"This means that the ICTR does not want to go up to the top ...
but not wanting to know who assassinated Juvenal Habyarimana or
pursue the crimes of senior RPF leaders, the court is thus
morally handicapped," he added.
</P>
<P>
The tribunal, formed in late 1994 to try masterminds of the
massacre, has also been faulted for failing to pursue alleged
genocide perpetrators within the RPF which took power in 1994.
