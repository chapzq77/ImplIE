JUDGE OKS NORTHWESTERN AIRLINES BANKRUPTCY-REFORM PLAN THE

<P>
New York -- Despite objections from its flight attendants union,
Northwest Airlines won court approval of its reorganization plan
Friday and pushed up the date it will exit bankruptcy from June
to May 31.
</P>
<P>
The airline expects to emerge from 20 months of Chapter 11
protection as a highly competitive carrier.
</P>
<P>
It forecasts 2007 earnings of nearly $800 million, in part buoyed
by $2.4 billion in annual savings including $1.4 billion from
employees in the form of wage, benefit and work-rule changes.
</P>
<P>
"We are pleased to have completed our restructuring
successfully," said Doug Steenland, the Eagan, Minn.-based
airline's president and chief executive officer.
</P>
<P>
"We are now focused on emerging from Chapter 11 as a strong,
publicly traded company which will provide excellent service to
our global customer base," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Today's court approval is the realization of the goals that were
set for the airline when we entered bankruptcy protection in
September 2005. At that time, we pledged to achieve a competitive
cost structure, a more efficient business model and a
recapitalized balance sheet."
</P>
<P>
U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Allan Gropper in New York held a two-day
hearing this week, where labor unions argued that Steenland and
other company executives would be grossly overpaid under
Northwest's proposed reorganization plan. The company has said it
will pay Steenland $26.6 million in stock and stock options when
it emerges; overall, senior executives will own 4.9 percent of
the airline.
</P>
<P>
Gropper approved the plan anyway. "There is no dispute it is
generous," Gropper said in court. "Any incentive plan designed to
be in the top quartile would be generous."
</P>
<P>
The unions aren't happy over the ruling.
</P>
<P>
Andy Wisbecker, a vice president of the 9,000 member Northwest
chapter of the Association of Flight Attendants, said it's a sad
day for American workers whose taxes pay for the court system.
</P>
<P>
"It was a little bit of a surprise because while we know that an
executive-compensation plan is part of any reorganization plan,
we didn't expect it to be this outrageous and obscene of a
number. We thought that Judge Gropper would use a little bit of
fairness in his ruling, but he didn't do anything about it."
</P>
<P>
The flight attendants are voting on a tentative agreement that
would save Northwest $195 million a year. Gropper allowed
Northwest to impose the cuts last July after the attendants
rejected two previous agreements. The company has pointed out
that it's sharing millions of dollars in profits with workers as
part of its reorganization plan.
</P>
<P>
One airline expert said the court's approval of the plan came as
no surprise.
</P>
<P>
Michael Boyd, an aviation consultant in Evergreen, Colo., said
it's clear that Northwest has its act together and knows how to
avert red ink like the $4 billion in losses it suffered since
2001. "Northwest will now be a very tough competitor. They will
grow around their global hub in Detroit and their route system to
Asia."
</P>
<P>
Boyd said Steenland's $26.6 million incentive package is much
less than the $40 million the United Airlines top executive got
when that carrier exited bankruptcy in February 2006 -- and
United is still in trouble.
</P>
<P>
"At least Steenland achieved something," Boyd said. "Look at all
the changes that have been made. Northwest is now ready to bolt
into the future."
</P>
<P>
Capt. Ray Miller, vice chairman of Northwest's 5,500-member Air
Line Pilots Association chapter, said the pilots were deeply
disappointed the pay equity pot for executives was not reduced.
</P>
<P>
"We have a bankruptcy judicial system that caters to the absolute
greed of corporate executives and supports the continued
extortion of pay, work rule and benefit concessions from labor,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
(info boxes)  WHAT'S NEXT FOR NORTHWESTERN Northwest has
accelerated plans to exit bankruptcy to May 31.
</P>
<P>
Its flight attendants will be concluding a vote May 29 on a new
tentative agreement. If the 9,000 attendants approve it,
Northwest will agree to settle a claim with the union for about
70 cents on the dollar with new stock. If the union rejects it,
they lose out on the settlement, which is about $15,000-$18,000
per attendant.
</P>
<P>
A new board of directors takes its seats on the day Northwest
emerges from bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
Northwest will cancel all existing stock and reissue new shares
under the ticker symbol NWA.
</P>
<P>
BANKRUPTCY PLAN HIGHLIGHTS
</P>
<P>
Under the reorganization plan approved Friday by Judge Allan
Gropper:
</P>
<P>
-- More than 97 percent of creditors eligible to vote on the
airline's reorganization plan have approved it.
</P>
<P>
-- Northwest's secured creditors will be paid in full. Most
unsecured creditors are expected to be paid between 66 cents and
83 cents on the dollar in new shares of the reorganized company.
</P>
<P>
-- Northwest Chief Executive Doug Steenland gets $26.6 million in
stock and options once the company emerges. Northwest also gives
outgoing Chairman Gary Wilson, $2 million as well as medical and
dental insurance for life and up to $75,000 a year for an office.
</P>
<P>
-- Northwest pays up to $5 million in fees and expenses incurred
by an ad hoc committee of equity holders, in return for the
committee dropping its opposition to the plan.
