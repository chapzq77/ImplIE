JOHANNESBURG, Oct. 18 (Xinhua)
</P>
<P>
South African shopping centers across the country are going to
tighten security as the annual major festival is approaching,
Business Against Crime (BAC) said here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a media conference, BAC's Jenni Irish-Qhobosheane said
the prevalence of violent crimes in shopping centers was of
serious concerns for the government, the business sector and the
law abiding citizens of the country.
</P>
<P>
South African police said that there are a sharp increase in
violent crimes in the country as Christmas is approaching.
December is the most dangerous season in the year with dramatic
growth in armed robberies.
</P>
<P>
She said this led to an establishment of a shopping center
security initiative, which is a partnership between the South
Africa Council of Shopping Centers, South African Property
Owners, the Consumer Goods Council of South Africa, and the BAC.
</P>
<P>
"The initiative provides an early warning system which assists
centers to identify their immediate risk," she added.
</P>
<P>
Irish-Qhobosheane said the BAC was working with the SA Police
Service to provide center management with information on latest
trends regarding violent crime.
</P>
<P>
"Our focus is more on how to prevent the occurrence of the
violent crimes than to deal with them."
</P>
<P>
Since the establishment of the initiative late last year, there
had been a 30 percent decrease in violent shopping center crimes.
</P>
<P>
The initiative was initially funded by Liberty Life Properties
and Pareto, but since its inception several major property owners
and managing companies had participated, Irish-Qhobosheane said.
