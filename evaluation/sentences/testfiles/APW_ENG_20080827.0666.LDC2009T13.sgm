Report: Pavlyuchenko about to join Tottenham

<P>
Tottenham may be about to bolster its depleted attack by signing
Roman Pavlyuchenko from Spartak Moscow after the Russia striker
said he is set to join the Premier League club.
</P>
<P>
The reluctant sale of Robbie Keane to Liverpool and a lengthy
impasse over Dimitar Berbatov's likely transfer to Manchester
United left Tottenham with only Darren Bent up front for its
opening two Premier League matches.
</P>
<P>
A pair of defeats and Bent's difficulty in adapting to the lone
forward role have increased Tottenham's need to sign a new
striker.
</P>
<P>
The 26-year-old Pavlyuchenko has been linked with Spurs since
scoring three goals in Russia's surprise run to the European
Championship semifinals in June and could now be about to move
after withdrawing from Spartak Moscow's Champions League
qualifier against Dynamo Kiev, which was scheduled for Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to Wednesday's edition of Moscow-based sports daily
Sovetsky Sport, Pavlyuchenko returned to Moscow from Kiev on
Tuesday for talks with Tottenham officials.
</P>
<P>
"Tottenham has already made a formal proposal," Spartak chairman
Valery Karpin was quoted as saying by Sovetsky Sport. "They have
made us a firm offer and we are happy with it.
</P>
<P>
"As long as Roman agrees to sign a deal with the club, we are
prepared to let him go. Footballers don't get chances like this
all the time, maybe only once in a lifetime. If Roman goes to
England, it will good for Tottenham and for himself."
</P>
<P>
Karpin did not say what the transfer fee would be, indicating
only that it is less than the Russian record euro30 million
(US$44 million) Zenit St. Petersburg paid for Portugal midfielder
Danny this week.
</P>
<P>
British papers have suggested he will cost about 12 million
pounds (US$12 million; euro8 million), far less than Zenit St.
Petersburg was asking Tottenham to pay for Pavlyuchenko's Russia
teammate Andrei Arshavin. That move now appears to be unlikely.
</P>
<P>
Sovetsky Sport quoted the player as saying money was not the
motivating factor in his desire to leave.
</P>
<P>
"That is not the reason for the move," Pavlyuchenko told the
paper. "The only thing that has kept me from moving is my family.
It was difficult for me to imagine how my wife and daughter could
move from a place they are used to. I was also embarrassed that I
could not speak English.
</P>
<P>
"But my doubts are all behind me now. I have decided I will sign
with Tottenham. Formalities will be settled in a day or two. I
will fly to England to sign the contract."
</P>
<P>
With the close of the transfer window just five days away,
Tottenham was involved in another move on Wednesday -- selling
South Korea fullback Lee Young-pyo to German side Borussia
Dortmund.
</P>
<P>
Lee played 93 times in three years at Tottenham, but gradually
slipped from the first team after the arrival of coach Juande
Ramos in October.
