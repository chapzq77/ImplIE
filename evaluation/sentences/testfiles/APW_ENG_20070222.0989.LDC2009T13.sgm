Israeli newspapers on Thursday ran front-page pictures of Defense
Minister Amir Peretz on a hill in the Golan Heights, inspecting
his troops through binoculars with the lens caps on.
</P>
<P>
It was just the latest embarrassment for Peretz, whose popularity
has plummeted in the wake of last summer's inconclusive war
against Hezbollah guerrillas in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Peretz joined the new army chief of staff, Lt. Gen. Gabi
Ashkenazi, watching Wednesday's large-scale maneuvers. The
pictures show the two side by side with military binoculars held
up to their eyes -- but Peretz's still have the lens caps in
place. The photographer said Peretz raised the capped binoculars
three times, nodding as Ashkenazi explained what he was "seeing."
</P>
<P>
The Maariv daily labeled its picture, "Seeing black." The Yediot
Ahronot daily paper softened the blow by also showing pictures of
other leaders looking through capped binoculars -- U.S. President
George W. Bush and former Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon.
</P>
<P>
Peretz has been under fire from the day took up his post last
year, because of his limited military background. Most Israeli
defense ministers have been ex-generals. His handling of the war
added weight to the criticism and spawned calls for his
replacement.
