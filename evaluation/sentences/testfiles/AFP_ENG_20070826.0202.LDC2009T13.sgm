France's Kouchner: Maliki must go
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner called for Iraqi Prime
Minister Nuri al-Maliki to be replaced and said the US government
had utterly failed to understand the country's ancient rivalries.
</P>
<P>
"I just had (US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice) on the phone
10 or 15 minutes ago, and I told her, 'Listen, he's got to be
replaced,'" Kouchner told the US magazine Newsweek, in an
interview published Sunday following his August 19-21 trip to
Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
"Many people believe the prime minister ought to be changed. I
don't know if that will go through, though, because it seems
President (George W.) Bush is attached to Mr Maliki. But the
government is not functioning," he said.
</P>
<P>
In Baghdad, Maliki called for an official French apology for
Kouchner's remarks.
</P>
<P>
"In the past you backed the former regime. Today we were happy
with you and then you decided to support the former regime's
loyalists. We demand an apology from the French government," he
said.
</P>
<P>
In Paris, a foreign ministry spokesman sought to downplay the
remarks, with a spokesman saying that Kouchner was merely
conveying views that he had heard during his visit to Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
"Concerning the remarks that are attributed to Mr Kouchner, he
was referring to ongoing debate that he witnessed during his
visit to Iraq," said foreign ministry spokesman Hugues Moret.
</P>
<P>
Kouchner also called for more European involvement in Iraq,
saying that "everything is at stake there, even for children and
grandchildren."
</P>
<P>
"The crisis in Iraq is, as I said, a crisis that threatens all of
us ... The more European ministers and delegations we get in
there the better."
</P>
<P>
Kouchner, a human rights activist and founder of the Doctors
Without Borders charity before joining the new government of
French President Nicolas Sarkozy in May, blasted some Iraqi
leaders he met during his trip.
</P>
<P>
"There are two sorts of people in Iraq: those who are realists
and who tell you things are going badly. And then those who are
out of touch with reality, who live in the Green Zone (of
Baghdad) and say that everything's fine, everything will work
out.
</P>
<P>
"It's not worth talking to them! They've got the world record for
refugees, for displaced people, for violence, for murders -- and
everything's fine! It's all the fault of someone else.
</P>
<P>
"The others, what do they say? That it's an extremely profound
crisis and if they don't get out of it soon, that's going to be
very bad indeed."
</P>
<P>
Kouchner said that the current situation is a "crucible" for all
the dangers faced by the world today.
</P>
<P>
"In this place called Iraq everything comes together, all the
problems of the world: the violence; murder as a way of doing
politics; the clash of religions; the confrontation of
communities that are theoretically allied and who talk to each
other but, in reality, are prolonging an ancient struggle for
dominance.
</P>
<P>
"All of that is mixed with the question of oil ... Then you have
the influence of neighboring countries who, through militias,
money and arms, are able to manipulate the situation in Iraq," he
told Newsweek.
</P>
<P>
"I think this is the crucible for even worse regional and global
violence. It's the globalization of terror. Everybody is there,
and not only Al-Qaeda. ... One of those, Iran, wants to become a
nuclear power."
</P>
<P>
Kouchner described the sectarian fighting in Iraq as the
extension of "6,000 years of violence" and said the United States
had not understood that.
</P>
<P>
"For them these are political matters, and political matters are
a history of settling scores among the big families and the big
parties (of Iraq). That's what it's like there. They've had 6,000
years of violence.
</P>
<P>
"So, finally, the daily death toll in Baghdad and in the country
doesn't interest them so much. And if you don't understand that,
you don't understand anything. That's one of the mistakes the
Americans made."
