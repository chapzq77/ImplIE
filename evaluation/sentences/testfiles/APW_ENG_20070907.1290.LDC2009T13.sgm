Q &amp; A: MTV president describes the ' total reinvention '  of
the Video Music Awards

"New and Improved" is a tried-and-true corporate cliche. If
Sunday's MTV Video Music Awards are a success, perhaps "Complete
and Total Reinvention" will become the new buzz packaging.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, what once was the most entertaining awards show
on TV has become a victim of its own excess, failing to match
such immortal moments as Britney tongue-kissing Madonna or Eminem
assaulting an insulting puppet. To bounce back, MTV (which is
owned by Viacom Inc.) upended its longtime format in a variety of
ways, including moving the show to a Las Vegas hotel and moving
some performers to "fantasy suites" where they will jam for their
hand-picked entourages.
</P>
<P>
MTV President Christian Norman spoke with The Associated Press
about recreating the anti-awards show.
</P>
<P>
AP: So why should people tune in this year?
</P>
<P>
Norman: To see the complete and total reinvention of the VMAs.
Last year's show had all the great music stars, but didn't
connect with the audience in the way they wanted it to. They
wanted us to mix it up. If you think about when the show first
started, no one did what we were doing. Now a lot of other people
were able to adapt.
</P>
<P>
AP: Is it harder to create a compelling show when viewers can see
these artists anytime they want on demand?
</P>
<P>
Norman: Live is what they love the most. They want to see what
the band hasn't done everywhere else. These fantasy suites fit
perfectly. You've seen these artists before, but never like this.
If artists just want to come on stage and do their single, this
is not the show for that.
</P>
<P>
AP: Last year you had live backstage feeds on your Web site. Why
aren't you doing that again?
</P>
<P>
Norman: This year we're driving them online to have a different
experience. The show is live that one night only. There are no
reruns. If you don't watch it on Sept. 9, you won't see it. The
repeats will be three different remixes. One is the artist
commentary version, the second is an all-music version with tons
of footage from the fantasy suites, and the last version is the
audience viewers' choice. We want people to go to mtv.com, look
at everything and rate the segments.
</P>
<P>
AP: How do you define success for this show? Just viewers, or
something else?
</P>
<P>
Norman: Obviously we'd like having a huge audience watch and go
online and interact with the show, and having great success for
our partners (who offer video on demand and streaming to wireless
customers). The show takes place in different forms everywhere.
To have those touchpoints work with the audience determines the
success for me.
</P>
<P>
AP: Why do you think last year's show was called dull?
</P>
<P>
Norman: I wouldn't say anything went wrong. It needed a complete
and total change. That's the thing about MTV -- music is always
evolving and we should evolve with it. We didn't take the cues to
evolve the show. Producing the same show now as you do in '99 is
ridiculous.
</P>
<P>
AP: After all the incredible things that have happened on the
show, can you be a success without that `eureka' moment?
</P>
<P>
Norman: It's great that people have fond memories, it gives us a
lot to aspire to. It's a lot to live up to, but we are poised to
deliver.
</P>
<P>
AP: It sounds like there's a lot of alcohol available for the
talent this year, kind of like a Golden Globes setup.
</P>
<P>
Norman: We've always had a green room and hospitality. In Vegas
we're doing tables for the audience as opposed to rows; that
gives talent more reason to stay in their seats. There's no green
room. They're sitting in the green room.
</P>
<P>
AP: This is year 24 of the VMAs. What do you think it will look
like at year 50?
</P>
<P>
Norman: Maybe it'll take place on this planet; maybe it won't.
