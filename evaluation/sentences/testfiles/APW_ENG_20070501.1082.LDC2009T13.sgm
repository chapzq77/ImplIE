commercial launch

Joost, a company attempting to broadcast television via the
Internet, said Tuesday it had signed several new content
distribution agreements, including one with Turner Broadcasting
System Inc. to show CNN news and interview programs.
</P>
<P>
The company also announced its "commercial availability" -- which
means it will allow current users to invite anyone to use its
service, which is free.
</P>
<P>
"Later this month we will be completely open" and allow anyone to
download the Joost software from the company's Web site, said
Yvette Alberdingk Thijm, the company's top executive for content
acquisition, in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
"This is the way you normally ramp up peer-to-peer software ...
and it's a way to give our friends a little bit of a scoop."
</P>
<P>
Joost -- pronounced "juiced" -- was co-founded by Janus Friis and
Niklas Zennstrom, the entrepreneurs who upset the music industry
with the Kazaa file-sharing service and then developed Skype, the
Internet telephone system that was bought by eBay Inc. for at
least US$2.6 billion in 2005.
</P>
<P>
Joost operates by distributing streaming video of shows from
"peer-to-peer," or user-to-user, over the Internet. Consumers
choose a channel via a software interface on their desktop that
resembles a remote control. Like regular TV, it is free for
viewers, and aims to be ad-supported.
</P>
<P>
In Tuesday's deal, Joost said it will air episodes of "Aqua Teen
Hunger Force" and "Robot Chicken" from Turner's Adult Swim
network, while it would air "Larry King Live," among other news
and interview programs from Turner's CNN, which is owned by Time
Warner Inc.
</P>
<P>
Joost also announced several other content deals Tuesday: Sony
will run episodes of several old TV series including "Charlie's
Angels" and "Starsky &amp; Hutch" on Joost; Sports Illustrated
will run photo shoots and programs about its swimsuit issue; the
National Hockey League will broadcast vintage games, game
highlights, and, later, full matches; and Hasbro will run old
episodes of "Transformers" and "G.I. Joe."
</P>
<P>
Joost has previously signed deals with Viacom Inc., Warner Music
Group Corp. and CBS Corp; it has advertising trials with numerous
companies, including Coca-Cola Co., Nike Inc., Microsoft Corp.,
Procter &amp; Gamble Co., Sony Corp. and Visa.
</P>
<P>
It is seen as one of the many candidates to become a primary
distributor of television and video over the Internet, competing
against Google Inc., YouTube, Revver Inc., broadcasters' own Web
sites, an as-yet unnamed cooperation between NBC and NewsCorp.,
and file-sharing programs such as BitTorrent, among others.
</P>
<P>
Joost's Viacom deal was particularly noteworthy as it came close
on the heels of Viacom's lawsuit against Google for alleged
copyright infringement.
</P>
<P>
In contrast to Kazaa, Joost actively seeks deals with copyright
holders and promises to protect music and images on its platform
against piracy.
</P>
<P>
"This is a mode of distribution that Viacom is more comfortable
with," said Loeb &amp; Loeb attorney Ken Florin, who was not
involved in Tuesday's deal.
</P>
<P>
"Internet ad revenue could become a very effective way to
monetize maybe not the same content, but content that appeals to
a different audience," specifically 18-34 year old men.
</P>
<P>
Alberdingk Thijm said Joost was not aiming to be a venue for
B-grade programming and reruns, pointing to CSI and Adult Swim
programs as among the highest viewer ratings in the U.S. cable
industry.
</P>
<P>
She could not disclose details of specific deals, but said ad
revenues were shared between Joost and the content providers;
while advertisers were charged on a per-view basis. Due to the
nature of Joost's Internet-based platform, ads are matched with
appropriate content and views are exactly measured, she said.
</P>
<P>
Alberdingk Thijm said the company is still experimenting with
when and how it will run ads, including short advertisements
before or after programs, traditional 30-second ads in the middle
of longer programs, and more experimental ideas such as ads that
appear on the screen briefly and then fade away while a program
is running.
</P>
<P>
Overall, she said, there would be less advertising than on
regular TV.
</P>
<P>
Joost is owned by Friis and Zennstrom via their Luxembourg-based
Joost Operations SA, but it has offices in New York, London and
Leiden, Netherlands, and expects to incorporate under the Joost
name globally.
