Under-fire Bush to pull out some troops from Iraq
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
US President George W. Bush on Thursday embraced a limited troop
draw-down from Iraq by mid-2008, but rejected calls for a full
withdrawal and said his successor would inherit a US presence
there.
</P>
<P>
"Because of the measure of success we are seeing in Iraq, we can
begin seeing troops come home," he said in the prepared text of a
prime-time speech. "The more successful we are, the more American
troops can return home."
</P>
<P>
Bush indicated that he had accepted advice from the US commander
in Iraq, General David Petraeus, that would bring some 5,700
troops home by Christmas and a total of 21,500 combat troops out
by mid-2008.
</P>
<P>
The US president's would leave about 130,000 troops in Iraq,
roughly the number in December 2006, one month before he
escalated US force levels in a thus-far failed effort to give
Iraq's leaders room to reach key compromises.
</P>
<P>
With most public opinion polls showing the US public two-to-one
opposed to his strategy, and his Democratic foes clamoring for a
withdrawal, Bush defiantly said he would build "an enduring
relationship" with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi leaders "understand that their success will require US
political, economic, and security engagement that extends beyond
my presidency," said Bush, whose term ends in January 2009.
</P>
<P>
"These Iraqi leaders have asked for an enduring relationship with
America. And we are ready to begin building that relationship in
a way that protects our interests in the region and requires many
fewer American troops," he said.
</P>
<P>
Bush also bluntly acknowledged he was not satisfied with the pace
of Iraqi political reforms that Washington views as critical to
forging national unity and quelling sectarian violence and urged
leaders in Baghdad to do more.
</P>
<P>
"The government has not met its own legislative benchmarks, and
in my meetings with Iraqi leaders, I have made it clear that they
must," said Bush, who was to speak at 9 pm (0100 GMT Friday) from
the Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
The president's plan came as the US Congress was poised to take
up Democratic efforts to end the war and as presidential
contenders faced tough questions on what they would do if elected
in November 2008.
</P>
<P>
Democratic Senator Jack Reed, giving his party's response, said
it was "time to change course" and urged support for "a plan to
responsibly and rapidly begin a reduction of our troops in Iraq."
</P>
<P>
Democrats lack the votes to set a timetable for ending the war,
but hope to secure Republican support to limit the US role in
Iraq to battling terrorists, training the Iraqi army and
protecting US personnel and installations.
</P>
<P>
They also hope to ensure that troops spend as much time at home
as they do deployed in the war zone -- an apparent bid to limit
the numbers of troops available for deployment.
</P>
<P>
The move came after two days of testimony by Petraeus and the US
ambassador in Baghdad, Ryan Crocker, before the White House
releases a progress report on the unpopular war on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Petraeus acknowledged in testimony to lawmakers that his draw-
down reflected the end of the "surge" Bush ordered in January,
but White House officials have couched it as the natural response
to progress in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"We've got a long way to go. It's very hard. We're realistic
about it," Bush spokeswoman Dana Perino.
</P>
<P>
Perino also denounced as an "outrage" the bombing that killed a
top Iraqi Sunni sheikh, Sattar Abu Reesha, who spearheaded a
campaign against Al-Qaeda in his restive home province of Anbar.
</P>
<P>
Abu Reesha, in his 40s, was the leading figure in the Anbar
Awakening Conference, a coalition of some 25 tribes that came
together a year ago and pledged to fight Al-Qaeda militants by
forming their own paramilitary units and supplying recruits to
the local police.
</P>
<P>
Opinion polls suggest that the war-weary US public is largely in
favor of a swift withdrawal from Iraq, where more than 3,700 US
soldiers and tens of thousands of Iraqis have been killed since
the March 2003 invasion.
</P>
<P>
White House aides acknowledge that the surge strategy has not
yielded what Bush identified as a central goal: passage by Iraq's
parliament of legislation seen as key to fostering national unity
and quelling the sectarian violence.
</P>
<P>
And they also say that it will not achieve a key goal: putting
Iraqis in charge of their own security by November 1.
