McCain and Obama Trade Barbs over Failed Bailout Plan
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLUMBUS, Ohio--John McCain, calling himself a man of action like
his hero, Teddy Roosevelt, told a raucous crowd here Monday that
he had helped lead the charge to pass the Wall Street rescue
plan. "I've never been afraid of stepping in to solve problems
for the American people," McCain said to cheers and applause.
</P>
<P>
Two hours later, the bailout plan that McCain had boasted of
working for went down to defeat in the House, with McCain's
fellow Republicans siding soundly against it.
</P>
<P>
As the stock market plummeted on the news, McCain was forced to
make a second and far more sober statement defending his work on
the rescue plan.
</P>
<P>
"I worked hard to play a constructive role in bringing everyone
to the table," he said  to news reporters gathered at his next
campaign stop, in Iowa. He said he had helped shape the bill to
lessen the risk to taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
The  failure of the rescue plan in the House, and the stock
market losses that followed, presented a challenge  to both major
presidential candidates, who cautiously had supported the plan
and had attended a high-profile meeting with President Bush last
week designed to advance a deal on the legislation.
</P>
<P>
After the plan failed Monday, each candidate urged Congress to
try again and called for a renewed spirit of bipartisanship--even
while the two campaigns traded blame and barbs.
</P>
<P>
Although Barack Obama, who was campaigning in the suburbs of
Denver, said no one person was at fault in the financial crisis
and that there was a "lot of blame to spread around," he urged
voters to consider McCain's record of favoring deregulation of
the nation's financial markets as they weighed which candidate
would best steer the nation's economic "ship into port."
</P>
<P>
"With so much at stake -- with our economy at risk, our
children's future in the balance -- the greatest risk in this
election is to repeat the same mistakes of the past," Obama said.
"We can't take a chance on that same losing game."
</P>
<P>
McCain also called for bipartisanship, yet he criticized his
Democratic rival.
</P>
<P>
"Senator Obama and his allies in Congress infused unnecessary
partisanship into the process," McCain said, referring to the
failed House vote. He continued: "Now is not the time to fix the
blame; it's time to fix the problem."
</P>
<P>
McCain's campaign went further, with senior policy adviser Doug
Holtz-Eakin placing the blame for the bailout's failure squarely
on the Democratic presidential candidate and his party.
</P>
<P>
"This bill failed because Barack Obama and the Democrats put
politics ahead of country," he said.
</P>
<P>
Obama spokesman Bill Burton characterized the statements as
"angry and hyper-partisan" and said they were "exactly why the
American people are disgusted with Washington."
</P>
<P>
The candidates spent Monday rallying voters in the battleground
states of Ohio and Colorado, which have a combined 29 electoral
votes.  Bush carried both in 2004, but polls show they will be
tight races in November.
</P>
<P>
McCain's running mate, Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, accompanied him
to the Columbus rally before traveling to Arizona, where she will
prepare for the vice presidential debate  Thursday in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
Palin said that she looked forward to debating Democrat Sen. Joe
Biden, whom she has not met.
</P>
<P>
"But I've been hearing about his speeches since I was in the
second grade," she quipped.
