ROME, April 12 (Xinhua)
</P>
<P>
Silvio Berlusconi is seeking a third term as Italy's prime
minister as voters go to polls Sunday and Monday to decide who
will lead their country during the next five years.
</P>
<P>
Born in Milan on Sept. 29, 1936, Berlusconi is not only a former
prime minister, but also an entrepreneur and media mogul.
</P>
<P>
He entered politics in 1994 as founder of the center-right Forza
Italia (Go, Italy) party and before the 2008 general election he
launched the new political party People of Freedom in February
which merged Forza Italia with National Alliance and other
liberal and conservative parties.
</P>
<P>
Berlusconi was elected prime minister following the March 1994
elections, when Forza Italia gained a relative majority a mere
three months after having been officially launched.
</P>
<P>
He formed the first right-wing administration in 34 years.
However, his cabinet collapsed after seven months, due to
internal disagreements in the center-right coalition.
</P>
<P>
In the 1996 elections, he ran for prime minister again but was
defeated by centre-left candidate Romano Prodi. From 1996 to 2001
he was the leader of the parliamentary opposition.
</P>
<P>
In the 2001 elections, he was again the center-right candidate
for prime minister and won against the center-left candidate
Francesco Rutelli.
</P>
<P>
Berlusconi then led the only one Italian government in the last
50 years that has lasted a full five-year term, but he lost the
April 2006 general election to Prodi, whose government collapsed
in January after 20 months in power.
</P>
<P>
An early election was therefore called for April 13 and 14.
Latest opinion polls put Berlusconi five to nine percentage
points ahead of his main opponent -- former Rome mayor Walter
Veltroni.
</P>
<P>
Four days ahead of the general election, Berlusconi said he was
100-percent sure that he could win, appealing to his supporters
to bring in more voters.
</P>
<P>
In economics, Berlusconi has endorsed conservative policies, such
as lowering taxes and generally placing fewer constraints on
enterprise, in an effort to encourage growth but also with the
risk of raising public deficit.
</P>
<P>
In foreign policy, his views have been strongly pro-American,
even at the expense of causing some damage to relations with
other European countries. In particular he supported George W.
Bush in the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in 2003 by sending Italian
troops to Iraq.
</P>
<P>
In social policy matters, the former Berlusconi government
implemented a conservative program: passing stricter laws
concerning immigration, artificial insemination and drug use.
</P>
<P>
In addition to a star politician, Berlusconi is the founder and
main shareholder of Fininvest, one of the ten largest Italian
privately-owned companies, which operate in media and finance. He
owns three of the seven national television channels, which
account for nearly half the Italian TV market, as well as some of
the country's most important newspapers.
</P>
<P>
He is also well known for being, since 1986, the president of
A.C. Milan, a prominent Italian football club. Under his
presidency it has won a number of national and international
trophies.
</P>
<P>
According to Forbes magazine, Berlusconi is Italy's second
richest person, with personal assets worth 9.4 billion U.S.
dollars in 2008, making him the world's 90th richest person.
</P>
<P>
Berlusconi's ownership of Italian television channels has been
controversial. According to Berlusconi's adversaries, his media
empire has played a crucial role in his political success. In
contrast, his supporters claim the networks have always
maintained a neutral political stance.
</P>
<P>
After Berlusconi's election as prime minister, the left accused
him of also abusing his position as premier to control the
publicly owned RAI TV channels.
</P>
<P>
He has been dogged by court cases relating to his Fininvest
business empire and has accused prosecutors of hounding him for
political reasons. Berlusconi went on trial again in late 2006
charged with fraud at broadcaster Mediaset, which his family
controls.
</P>
<P>
Berlusconi married former actress Veronica Lario in 1990, by whom
he has three children. Berlusconi has two more children from a
previous marriage.
