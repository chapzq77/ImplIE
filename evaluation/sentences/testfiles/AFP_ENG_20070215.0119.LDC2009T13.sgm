Nature group launches China website for scientific, medical
research

The British publishing group Nature announced Thursday it was
launching an international site to showcase the best research
coming from China, considered a fast-growing source of
developments in science and medicine.
</P>
<P>
Nature China (www.naturechina.com) will also include research
from Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
"In the past decade, the output of research papers from China in
the Thomson ISI database has soared from 10,000 a year to over
80,000," Nature Publishing Group (NPG) said in a press release.
</P>
<P>
Thomson ISI, also called Thomson Scientific, is a portal of
scientific studies.
</P>
<P>
In terms of numbers, the output of Chinese papers is now equal to
that of Britain and Japan, NPG said.
</P>
<P>
In terms of quantity -- as measured by the number of citations in
other papers -- the number of high-impact papers from China has
increased tenfold, to several hundred a year, it said.
</P>
<P>
The website is being sponsored by a major pharmaceutical group.
</P>

In January 2006, a report by the UN Educational, Scientific and
Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) said China was leading the charge
by emerging Asian countries to challenge the supremacy of the
United States, Europe and Japan in research and development.
</P>
<P>
Spending on R and D in China in 2002 was 1.23 percent of gross
domestic product (GDP), compared with 0.83 percent in 1999, it
said.
</P>
<P>
China still lags when it comes to innovation, though. Sweden came
first in the table for ground-breaking research, followed by
Japan and the United States, which in turn were followed by
Finland, Switzerland, Britain and Denmark.
