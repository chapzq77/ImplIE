TWO FIRED IN SEX COVER-UP AT TEXAS JUVENILE AGENCY
</HEADLINE>

AUSTIN, Texas
</P>
<P>
Gov. Rick Perry on Wednesday ousted the chairman of the Texas
Youth Commission over charges that the agency covered up the
sexual abuse of incarcerated juveniles.
</P>
<P>
Perry also called for removal of the acting executive director,
appointment of an independent inspector general, and a shakeup
throughout the commission, which runs 13 schools housing some
3,000 felons under 21.
</P>
<P>
"Leadership starts at the top, and the governor believes the very
top leadership has failed," a spokesman, Ted Royer, said.
</P>
<P>
Late Wednesday, the State Senate went back into session to debate
a stronger response to the allegations.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the State Senate Criminal Justice Committee aired
details of long-secret investigations by the youth commission and
the Texas Rangers showing that two supervisors at the West Texas
State School in remote Pyote routinely roused boys from their
beds for sexual encounters that were reported but went unpunished
by the school's superintendent, who now holds a top leadership
position at the commission. The supervisors were allowed to
resign without facing criminal charges, but are now under
investigation.
</P>
<P>
The dismissed chairman, Pete C. Alfaro, is a former mayor of
Baytown who was first named to the commission in 1995 by Gov.
George W. Bush and was appointed chairman by Perry in 2004.
Alfaro did not respond to messages seeking comment. His latest
five-year term was to expire in August.
</P>
<P>
Hours after the governor's spokesman said that Alfaro had been
told by phone that he was being replaced by his vice chairman,
Donald R. Bethel, a spokesman for the Texas Youth Commission, Tim
Savoy, said that the agency had still received no notice of the
action. The board has a meeting scheduled for next Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Perry, a Republican, also called on the remaining six board
members to replace the acting executive director, Neil Nichols,
who is the general counsel and a 33-year veteran of the agency.
Nichols took over last Friday upon the sudden retirement of the
executive director, Dwight Harris, who started as a caseworker in
1981.
</P>
<P>
The governor said that Ed Owens, deputy executive director of the
Texas Department of Criminal Justice, had agreed to serve as the
commission's acting executive director.
</P>
<P>
Though the governor makes appointments to the seven-member board,
he has the power by himself only to remove the chairman, legal
experts said. He can fire other members upon a finding of gross
fiscal mismanagement by a legislative audit committee made up of
the two legislative leaders, Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst in the
Senate and House Speaker Tom Craddick, both Republicans, and two
other members from each chamber.
</P>
<P>
Dewhurst on Wednesday demanded sweeping changes in the
commission. Sen. John Whitmire, a Houston Democrat and chairman
of the criminal justice committee that heard the cover-up
allegations, said Wednesday "I have no confidence in the board"
but that Perry was not yet ready to seek its ouster.
