Citigroup: SEC probing tax issues tied to 2000 acquisition of
Associated First Capital

NEW YORK 2007-02-26 16:41:49 UTC

<P>
The Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating tax
issues stemming from Citigroup's 2000 acquisition of a financing
company, the largest U.S. bank said.
</P>
<P>
Citigroup said in its annual report, filed late Friday, that the
SEC's investigation involves "the treatment of certain specific
tax reserves and releases during the period 2000 to 2004 related
to the Associates businesses acquired in the 2000 fourth
quarter."
</P>
<P>
In September 2000, Citigroup bought Associates First Capital
Corp., a financing company that is now a Citigroup subsidiary.
</P>
<P>
Citigroup described the probe as being part of a previously
disclosed investigation into the company's treatment of potential
losses in Argentina in the fourth quarter of 2001. As Citigroup
has said in previous filings, the SEC has subpoenaed witness
testimony and accounting and internal-controls information from
1997 through 2004.
</P>
<P>
Citigroup said it is cooperating with the probe but cannot
predict its outcome. A Citigroup spokeswoman declined to comment
beyond the filing.
</P>
<P>
The investigation comes after Citigroup Chief Executive Charles
Prince pushed for -- and declared victory in -- a companywide
cleanup of Citigroup's internal controls and governance
practices, following a series of run-ins with regulators around
the world.
