KING PORTRAIT PROPOSAL DIES IN COMMITTEE

ATLANTA -- A proposal to hang a portrait of Coretta Scott King in
the state Capitol died in a legislative committee Wednesday,
prompting a racially charged rebuke from the measure's sponsor.
</P>
<P>
House Special Rules Committee members said they rejected the
measure because they believe King has already been sufficiently
recognized and the Capitol should be reserved for Georgia
lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
Rep. Roberta Abdul-Salaam (D-Riverdale), who sponsored the
resolution, lashed out at the committee, saying its action was
worse than radio shock jock Don Imus calling the Rutgers
University women's basketball team "nappy-headed hos."
</P>
<P>
"It is just like calling Mrs. King a nappy-headed (N-word),"
Abdul-Salaam told reporters after the committee rejected House
Resolution 376, killing it for this legislative session.
</P>
<P>
"There is already talk about boycotting in this country. We just
need to really expand it to Georgia, if necessary," she said. "It
is absolutely time to realize that you cannot continue to conduct
yourselves in such a manner and think that there will be no
repercussions."
</P>
<P>
Committee chairman Calvin Hill (R-Canton) said race had nothing
to do with his panel's decision, calling King a "wonderful
humanitarian."
</P>
<P>
"It is an emotional overreaction," Hill said of Abdul-Salaam's
comments. "She may be under the misunderstanding that this is a
museum at the Capitol. It is not a museum."
</P>
<P>
After Abdul-Salaam presented her proposal to the committee, Rep.
Doug Holt (R-Social Circle) motioned for the panel to pass the
resolution. But no one on the three-member committee seconded the
motion, so the resolution died.
</P>
<P>
"I think that Coretta Scott King has been remembered
sufficiently..." committee member Mike Keown (R-Coolidge) said in
an interview after the meeting. "I think the King Center is going
to stand forever. And it will always be a monument to the legacy
of the Kings. And, respectfully, I think that more than anything,
Coretta Scott King is going to be remembered as the wife of
Martin Luther King Jr."
</P>
<P>
King died last year after battling ovarian cancer and the effects
of a stroke. Abdul-Salaam's resolution calls her a hero and cites
her "tireless work on behalf of a free and equal society." The
resolution urges the Capitol Arts Standards Commission to
authorize hanging a portrait of Coretta Scott King on the second
floor of the State Capitol next to a picture of her late husband,
Martin Luther King Jr. The Legislature created the commission
last year to set standards for new artwork in the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
Abdul-Salaam said she now plans to ask Republican Gov. Sonny
Perdue to issue an executive order for King's portrait to be hung
in the Capitol. A spokesman for the governor, however, said
Wednesday that Abdul-Salaam should direct her request to the
commission.
</P>
<P>
Perdue called Abdul-Salaam's use of the racial epithet an
"unfortunate choice of words. But some people feel very
passionately about things. Sometimes they get very emotional in
the way that they characterize people's motives and actions."
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't there," Perdue told reporters, "but I've made motions
before that didn't get a second. It's not always fun, but that's
the way our government works."
</P>
<P>
Rep. Al Williams (D-Midway), the head of Georgia's Legislative
Black Caucus, said he supports hanging Coretta Scott King's
portrait in the Capitol but he disagreed with Abdul-Salaam's
comparison with the Imus controversy.
</P>
<P>
"I think the two are completely different. I'm dealing with a
radio [disc jockey] who feels as though insulting women in
general and blacks in particular is great for ratings," Williams
said. "I even hate to stand here and use Imus' name in the same
sentence as Mrs. King's."
</P>
<P>
A similar proposal to hang a portrait of Coretta Scott King in
the Capitol died in the General Assembly last year. Critics say
the Capitol should be reserved for portraits of lawmakers from
Georgia. Several non-Georgians, however, are honored in portraits
already on display in the Capitol, including Confederate Gen.
Robert E. Lee of Virginia and President Andrew Jackson, a South
Carolina native.
</P>
<P>
"Mrs. King was a wonderful person and has done a lot of wonderful
things but the [Capitol] venue is designed for people that are
involved in the government of the state of Georgia primarily,"
Hill said. "And there are a few exceptions, but very few. And
those were made a long time ago."
