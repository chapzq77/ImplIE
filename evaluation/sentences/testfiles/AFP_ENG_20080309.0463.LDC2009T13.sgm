Tracy McGrady had 41 points and nine assists as the Houston
Rockets won their 18th consecutive game with a 106-96 win over
New Orleans on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
McGrady fell just six points short of his season high for points
as the Rockets extended their franchise-record win streak.
</P>
<P>
McGrady finished 17-of-27 from the floor, including three-of-
eight from the three-point line as the Rockets set a season high
with 14 three-pointers.
</P>
<P>
The Rockets won their sixth in a row since Chinese all-star Yao
Ming went out for the season with a stress fracture in his left
foot. Yao had surgery earlier in the week.
</P>
<P>
Houston (42-20) - on a 12-game winning streak at home - has won
22 of 23 and is 27-4 since the start of 2008, pushing it into
third place in the Western Conference playoff picture.
</P>
<P>
The Rockets should have a good chance of winning their next
three, playing New Jersey and Charlotte at home sandwiched around
a road trip to New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
McGrady scored 10 points for Houston in the first quarter, but
New Orleans led 23-20 at the end of the period on Saturday.

<P>
The Rockets rallied in the fourth and cruised to the longest win
streak in the NBA this season.
