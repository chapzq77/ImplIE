Three militants of the outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK)

According to a statement of the local governor's office, the PKK

The PKK has increased attacks on Turkish troops in southeastern
Turkey in recent months that led to Turkey's mounting intention
of an incursion into northern Iraq to crush the PKK.

The PKK launched an armed campaign for an ethnic homeland in the
mainly Kurdish southeastern Turkey in 1984, sparking decades of
strife that has claimed more than 30,000 lives.

<P>
The PKK is listed as a terrorist organization by Turkey, the
United States and the European Union.
