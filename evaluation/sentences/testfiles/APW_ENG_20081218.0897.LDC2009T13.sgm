Bush considering `orderly '  auto bankruptcy

WASHINGTON 2008-12-18 16:25:14 UTC

<P>
The Bush administration is seriously considering "orderly"
bankruptcy as a way of dealing with the desperately ailing U.S.
auto industry.
</P>
<P>
White House press secretary Dana Perino said Thursday, "There's
an orderly way to do bankruptcies that provides for more of a
soft landing. I think that's what we would be talking about."
</P>
<P>
President George W. Bush, asked about an auto rescue plan during
an appearance before a private group, said he had not decided
what he would do.
</P>
<P>
But he, like Perino, spoke of the idea of bankruptcies organized
by the federal government as a possible way to go.
</P>
<P>
"Under normal circumstances, no question bankruptcy court is the
best way to work through credit and debt and restructuring," he
said. "These aren't normal circumstances. That's the problem."
</P>
<P>
At the White House, Perino said, "The president is not going to
allow a disorderly collapse of the companies. A disorderly
collapse would be something very chaotic that is a shock to the
system."
</P>
<P>
She said the White House was close to a decision and emphasized
there were still several possible approaches to assisting the
automakers, such as short-term loans out of a $700 billion Wall
Street rescue fund. Bush has resisted this approach before, and
it is adamantly opposed by many other Republicans.
</P>
<P>
"It's in the spectrum of options and there are a lot of options,"
Perino said.
</P>
<P>
She said one of the factors delaying an announcement on an auto
rescue plan is the continuing discussion between the
administration and the various sides that would have to sign on
to a managed bankruptcy, such as labor unions and equity holders
in addition to the companies themselves.
</P>
<P>
"In any scenario that comes forward after this decision-making
process, all those stakeholders are going to have to make tough
decisions," she said.
</P>
<P>
The presidential spokeswoman would not put a timetable on when an
announcement would come, and suggested it might not happen this
week. But something must be done, she said.
</P>
<P>
"If you thought that our economy today could handle the collapse
of the American auto industry, then you might come to the
conclusion that doing nothing was an option," Perino said. "We're
going to do something."
</P>
<P>
Bush was speaking to the American Enterprise Institute, a
conservative Washington think tank.
