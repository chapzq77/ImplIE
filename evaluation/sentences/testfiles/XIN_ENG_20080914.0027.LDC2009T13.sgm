BAGHDAD, Sept. 14 (Xinhua)
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi parliament voted on Sunday to lift immunity of secular
lawmaker, Mithal al-Alusi for his visit to Israel last week to
attend a conference about fighting terrorism, an Iraqi official
television reported.
</P>
<P>
The parliament voted by a majority to lift the immunity of the
Alusi, a Sunni, who also will be banned from travelling outside
Iraq along with taking legal actions against him, the Iraqia
channel said in a televised session.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Alusi argued that "I wasn't representing Iraq when
I went there, it was a personal visit following an invitation. "
</P>
<P>
He said that the conference was attended by Arab and Muslim
countries along with dozens of world nations, insisting that he
has the tight to attend any conference in the world that
discusses the Iraqi issue.

<P>
In 2004, Alusi visited Israel for the same reason. At that time
he was a member of the Iraqi National Congress, a party headed by
Ahmed Chalabi.
</P>
<P>
Chalabi's party expelled Alusi for his visit, pushing him to set
up his own party known as the Democratic Umma, of which Alusi
gained a single seat in the 275-member parliament.
