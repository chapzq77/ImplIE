Indonesia's foreign exchange reserves rose by 1.5 billion U.S.
dollars to 54.3 billion in October from the previous month thanks
to surplus in the balance of payment and stronger rupiah, a
central bank official said Wednesday.

"The international reserves are in a comfort level at the
meantime," Bank Indonesia deputy governor Miranda Goeltom said
here.

The rupiah has gained 0.6 percent against the dollar so far this
year, she said.

<P>
"The gain supported our balance of payment and in a short-term
created a bigger surplus."
