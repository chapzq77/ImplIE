A CLERIC'S JOURNEY LEADS HIM TO A SUBURBAN FRONTIER
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MIDDLETOWN, N.J.
</P>
<P>
Sheik Reda Shata pushed into Costco behind an empty cart. He wore
a black leather jacket over his long, rustling robe, a pocket
Quran tucked inside.
</P>
<P>
The imam, a 38-year-old Egyptian, seemed not to notice the stares
from other shoppers. He was hunting for a bargain, and soon found
it in the beverage aisle, where a 32-can pack of Coca-Cola sold
for $8.29. For Shata, this was a satisfying Islamic experience.
</P>
<P>
"The Prophet said, 'Whoever is frugal will never suffer
financially,"' said the imam, who shops weekly at the local store
and admits to praying for its owners. He smiled. "These are the
people who will go to heaven."
</P>
<P>
Seven months have passed since Shata moved to this suburban town
in New Jersey to lead a mosque of prosperous, settled immigrants.
It is a world away from Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, where he toiled for
almost four years, serving hundreds of struggling Muslims for
whom America was still new.
</P>
<P>
His transition is a familiar one for foreign-born imams in the
United States, who often start out in city mosques before moving
to more serene settings.
</P>
<P>
For Shata, Middletown promised comfort after years of hardship.
He left behind a tiny apartment for a house with green shutters
set amid maple trees and sweeping lawns. He got a raise. He
learned to drive.
</P>
<P>
But the suburbs have brought challenges that Shata never
imagined. His congregation in Brooklyn may have been on the
margins of American society, but it was deeply rooted in Islam.
Muslims in Middletown are generally more assimilated but less
connected to their mosque.
</P>
<P>
To be a successful suburban imam, he found, meant persuading
doctors and lawyers not to rush from prayers to beat traffic. It
meant connecting with teenagers who drove new cars, and who
peppered their Arabic with "like" and "yeah." It meant helping
his daughter cope with mockery at school, in a town that lost
dozens of people Sept. 11 2001.
</P>
<P>
Shata knew from his years in Brooklyn that the job demanded more
than preaching and leading prayers, the things for which he was
trained in Egypt. In America, he helped to arrange marriages. He
mediated between the FBI and his people. He set up a makeshift
Islamic court to resolve disputes among hot dog vendors.
</P>
<P>
Last summer, as he prepared to join a new community where the
median income is roughly $86,000, he reminded himself that Islam
has no quarrel with wealth -- as long as the wealthy are pious.
Still, he was stunned when a man at the mosque bought his
daughter a new car, only for her to request a different model.
</P>
<P>
"Islam says to a Muslim you can own the world if you want, but
don't get attached to it," said Shata, speaking Arabic through a
translator. "Put the world in your hands, not your heart."
</P>
<P>
The open spaces of Monmouth County appealed to the imam after
years in a crowded city. But with space comes distance. It hardly
surprised Shata that prayer attendance was thin; many congregants
live more than 20 miles away.
</P>
<P>
In a land of Little League and shopping malls, signs of Muslim
identity are few. At first glance, Shata's new mosque could pass
for an elegant office building. It has no minaret and a barely
visible dome.
</P>
<P>
Girls in head scarves are scarce at the local public schools.
Some cover their heads with hooded sweatshirts.
</P>
<P>
Compared with his congregants, the imam sometimes looks like an
apparition from another century. In his silk hat and robe, he
preaches to men in suits or blue jeans, cell phones clasped to
their belts.
</P>
<P>
But Shata believes this group is vital to Islam's future in the
West. The religion's survival, he said, depends not only on its
ability to flourish in the immigrant footholds of America, but in
its most settled corners.
</P>
<P>
"We are in this country, and we must learn to live with its
people," Shata said. "We have to absorb them and they have to
absorb us."
</P>
<P>
One sunny afternoon in September, the mosque's parking lot was
empty but for a red 1997 Dodge Neon. It circled around and
around, with Shata at the wheel. He was practicing for his
driving test.
</P>
<P>
"Now we're at the stop sign, and we must stop out of respect," he
said, slamming on the brakes. The car halted violently. Then he
stomped his sandaled foot on the gas, and the car lurched ahead.
</P>
<P>
Shata had never driven a car until he moved to Middletown. As a
boy, he became frightened of driving after a tractor killed a man
in his Egyptian farming village. Since moving to the United
States in 2002, he had managed without a car. But in the suburbs
he had no choice.
</P>
<P>
Middletown is only 43 miles southwest of the city, but to Shata,
it seemed farther.
</P>
<P>
In Brooklyn, his daily walk to the mosque, Masjid Moussab, caused
a commotion, with cabdrivers honking and shopkeepers waving. In
Middletown, where Shata now lives next to the mosque, he sees
deer and rabbits on his way to the dawn prayer.
</P>
<P>
But Brooklyn had a way of following him. Fathers in Bay Ridge
still sought the imam's help in finding suitable husbands for
their daughters. Unhappy wives called for the imam's marital
advice.
</P>
<P>
Every Friday, a dozen of Shata's former Brooklyn congregants
began appearing in Middletown to hear his weekly sermon.
</P>
<P>
"Maybe he's here in body, but his soul is there," said Amgad
Abdou, an Egyptian driver who came every week, his limousine
full. "He's like the Statue of Liberty, part of the skyline. He's
part of Bay Ridge."
</P>
<P>
(END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
Shata missed the city at times. But his relationship with Muslims
in Brooklyn had changed after a series of articles about him
appeared in The New York Times last March.
</P>
<P>
At first, he found himself a minor celebrity. The articles were
reprinted in Arabic-language newspapers, both in the United
States and the Middle East. Hundreds of strangers reached out to
him, seeking advice.
</P>
<P>
The imam's "little black book" -- a roster of Muslims in search
of spouses -- quickly lengthened, by a third, to 820 phone
numbers and names.
</P>
<P>
But the articles also stirred a controversy Shata never expected.
Many Muslims were shocked to read that the imam thought oral sex
was permissible for married couples (even though respected
Islamic scholars in the Middle East concurred with his opinion,
he said). Others objected to his view that Muslims could sell
liquor or pork if they could find no other work.
</P>
<P>
One critique of Shata on a jihadist Web site in England singled
out his hometown, Kafr al Battikh, which is known for its
watermelons. "Oh, Allah," it read, "preserve Islam and Muslims
from the evil people of watermelons."
</P>
<P>
In Bay Ridge, the articles prompted a fistfight outside a Dunkin'
Donuts. Fliers warned in Arabic that the imam was "a devil."
</P>
<P>
"He just wanted to please the West," said Hesham Elashry, a local
Egyptian tailor. "No one can change Islam to make people happy."
</P>
<P>
After weeks of defending himself, Shata felt worn down.
</P>
<P>
Other mosques had long tried to lure him away. As word of his
troubles spread, recruiters stepped forward.
</P>
<P>
"He was tied to his people," said Mohammed Mosaad, who sits on
the board of the mosque in Middletown.
</P>
<P>
Like many suburban mosques, Masjid Al-Aman, which means "mosque
of peace," began in the 1980s with a group of families who met
privately to pray. Eventually, they bought a six-acre property on
Red Hill Road and raised $1.7 million to build their mosque,
which was completed in 2003.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the mosque, which has a largely Egyptian congregation,
called the imam for months. They offered to renovate a house on
the property, with a new kitchen and a custom-made library.
</P>
<P>
Shata prayed for a sign from God. One morning at dawn, the imam
said, he heard a voice telling him that the mosque in Middletown
"is peace."
</P>
<P>
He resigned that day.
</P>
<P>
PLANTING NEW ROOTS
</P>
<P>
One evening in July, shortly before Shata moved to the suburbs,
he paid the mosque in Middletown a visit. Crickets chirped. The
grass whispered. The stars blinked from above.
</P>
<P>
The imam circled the mosque, accompanied by three friends. He
paused to look at the trees, which seemed to sparkle.
</P>
<P>
Shata turned to the men and asked if the forest might have jinn,
the Arabic word for spirits.
</P>
<P>
"No," one of the men replied. "The bugs light up here."
</P>
<P>
It was one of many things that impressed Shata about his new
environment. He loved to sit on his front porch and write his
Friday sermons. The rain, he said, was "like a symphony of
music."
</P>
<P>
In Brooklyn, the imam's family rarely left their apartment. His 8
-year-old daughter, Rawda, is epileptic and used to suffer
frequent seizures. Now the four children run freely on the grass.
Rawda has not had a seizure for months, ever since doctors
changed her medication.
</P>
<P>
The imam's wife, Omyma, looked up at the sky one September
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
"Smell! Smell!" she said, inhaling deeply. "Pure oxygen. Pure."
</P>
<P>
But if Shata's family life had improved, his new mosque needed
work.
</P>
<P>
In Bay Ridge, congregants lingered after prayers, exchanging
kisses and hugs. In Middletown, an air of anonymity hung over the
mosque.
</P>
<P>
"We needed someone to bring us together," said one member, Omar
Mostafa, 42.
</P>
<P>
Shata began by memorizing the names of his roughly 600
congregants and tracking their attendance. (The same prodigious
memory had enabled him to memorize the Quran by the age of 8.)
</P>
<P>
A Jordanian-born cardiologist, Raed Jitan, missed the Friday
prayer soon after he was introduced to the new imam. When the
doctor reappeared at the mosque, he was stunned to hear Shata
call out, "Raed, where have you been?"
</P>
<P>
It became common to hear the imam interrupt himself, midsermon,
with admonitions like, "Ahmed, don't fall asleep on me."
</P>
<P>
One Friday, Shata ordered the congregants to stand up and
exchange compliments. Another day, he told them they could not
leave before shaking hands.
</P>
<P>
By the early fall, Masjid Al-Aman was a different place.
Attendance at daily prayers had quadrupled. The imam's evening
lectures were packed.
</P>
<P>
"The seeds have taken root very fast," Shata said.
</P>
<P>
He was relieved that many of his new congregants seemed modern-
minded. But he is still adjusting to the fact that, at dinner
parties, men and women often eat together. (Such engagements do
not violate Islamic law, Shata said, but he and his wife prefer
more traditional gatherings where men and women sit in separate
rooms and have their own entrances.)
</P>
<P>
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
Shata uses Islamic contracts in Middletown, as he had in
Brooklyn, to help settle disputes between married couples. But
the money involved sometimes makes him gasp. In Brooklyn, a man
had agreed to pay his wife $10 every time he insulted her. In
Middletown, a similar contract brought $1,000 per insult.
</P>
<P>
Wealth became a frequent theme in his sermons.
</P>
<P>
"The true value of a person is not in his clothing, car or bank
account, but in his account with Allah," he said in one sermon.
</P>
<P>
At times, Shata could not help but think of his own financial
status. He told himself that it did not matter that his house was
modest compared with the "palaces" of some congregants, or that
his used Dodge stood out among their Lexuses and BMWs.
</P>
<P>
"I am very satisfied with what God has given me," he said one
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
He did not know then that his 12-year-old daughter, Esteshhad,
wanted to ask him for a cell phone.
</P>
<P>
(END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
A GENERATION TO GUIDE
</P>
<P>
On Sunday mornings, the main worship area of the mosque -- a
place normally reserved for men -- becomes a teenage oasis.
</P>
<P>
Girls in head scarves sit to one side, and boys in sweatshirts
and varsity jackets to the other. Their cell phones beep with
text messages as the imam stands before them.
</P>
<P>
"Who has a question today?" he asked one recent Sunday.
</P>
<P>
A curly-haired boy raised his hand. "According to the Prophet, at
what age should a young man get married?" he asked.
</P>
<P>
Shata launched into a careful lecture about how modern life is
different from the Prophet's time, when boys married at 16.
Islam, he said, dictates no specific age.
</P>
<P>
"Can a man marry more than one wife?" another boy asked.
</P>
<P>
"Why are the questions about marriage today?" the imam replied.
"What's going on?"
</P>
<P>
The room was silent. He wiped his glasses, trying to buy time.
</P>
<P>
"If you are able to marry one," he finally said, "don't think
about marrying another one."
</P>
<P>
Another hand shot up, that of a 16-year-old girl. "What are the
specific circumstances that allow a man to marry a second wife?"
the girl, Sara Abdelmottlib, asked.
</P>
<P>
Once again, the imam was cornered. Back in Egypt, young Muslims
were reticent in the presence of sheiks. But in America, Shata
noticed, children are taught to ask many questions.
</P>
<P>
Shata had no doubt about the answer: According to Islamic law, a
man is allowed up to four wives. But the imam also believed that
such arrangements never worked, and that discussing them was
unhelpful in the United States.
</P>
<P>
He stared at the girls.
</P>
<P>
"There is no woman out there who agrees to her husband marrying a
second wife, even if she cannot bear children," he said.
</P>
<P>
Then he turned to the boys. "A man who is not satisfied with one
wife will never be satisfied with four," he said.
</P>
<P>
Abdelmottlib looked over at the boys, her chin raised in triumph.
</P>
<P>
Shata often feels out of place among his youngest congregants.
They seem so different from him -- the way they dress, the way
they speak, even the way they think. But he considers no part of
his job more important.
</P>
<P>
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
"The tree of faith in their hearts has to be constantly watered
before it dries up," he said.
</P>
<P>
It seemed to Shata that young Muslims in the suburbs had no guide
to help them balance Islamic virtues with adolescent urges, the
culture of their parents with the pressures of their peers.
</P>
<P>
Some men at the mosque complained that their sons refused to kiss
their hands in a show of respect. Shata sided with the boys: This
tradition was cultural, he said, not Islamic.
</P>
<P>
Other parents forbade their daughters from joining swim teams at
school, arguing that Islamic law does not allow women to reveal
their bodies in public. The imam suggested a compromise: they
could swim in bodysuits, with only females present.
</P>
<P>
Still, it was one thing for Shata to mediate these problems at
the mosque, and another to face them at home.
</P>
<P>
One afternoon this month, a yellow school bus with mechanical
problems pulled into the mosque's parking lot.
</P>
<P>
The imam had just finished the afternoon prayer and was leaving
the mosque. Eagerly, he walked up to the bus, his long robe
flapping. He wondered if his daughter Esteshhad might be onboard.
</P>
<P>
As he drew closer, he saw the children pointing at him and
laughing. He struggled, in English, to offer the driver help, but
she politely declined. He searched for his daughter. It was not
her bus. Relieved, he walked away.
</P>
<P>
For Esteshhad, life had been hard enough, he thought. After
attending an Islamic school in Brooklyn, she is now one of only
two girls who wear head scarves at her public middle school. She
sits alone at the front of her bus. In the cafeteria, she eats by
herself.
</P>
<P>
"They keep thinking I'm weird," she said. "I feel weird, too."
</P>
<P>
She hears about sleepovers and trips to the mall, but she has yet
to experience these things. Her mother cannot drive, and Shata is
reluctant to chauffeur his children until he feels safer in the
car.
</P>
<P>
Outside school, Esteshhad's only other contact with her peers
comes at the mosque. But even there -- where some girls carry
designer bags -- she often feels left out.
</P>
<P>
One night this month, she sat slouched on the edge of her bed. If
only she had a cell phone or an iPod, she said, she might have
friends.
</P>
<P>
"I have friends," her 7-year-old sister, Rahma, piped up.
</P>
<P>
"You don't wear a hijab," Esteshhad shot back.
</P>
<P>
Recently, her mother noticed that Esteshhad had forgotten parts
of the Quran. She was also becoming more assertive.
</P>
<P>
A sign outside her room read, "Please knock before entering!" and
then, in smaller letters, "I'm angry."
</P>
<P>
Esteshhad's mother has thought of enrolling her again in an
Islamic school, but Shata is reluctant. He wants to give public
school a chance. Still, it pains him to see Esteshhad so alone.
</P>
<P>
When asked how he would respond if Esteshhad stopped wearing a
head scarf, the imam thought for a moment. Such a scenario, for
him, would have been unthinkable in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</P>
<P>
"I would try to convince her and I would find 1,001 ways to her
heart," he said. "I hate aggression. The Prophet, peace be upon
him, said, 'Teach, don't humiliate."'
</P>
<P>
Teaching, for the imam, also means learning. He will learn as he
goes, he said, with Esteshhad at school, with the teenagers at
his mosque.
</P>
<P>
It is a path he began in Brooklyn. To live an Islamic life in
America, he said, requires a curious mind and a strong heart.
</P>
<P>
Shata tries to bring both to his youth group every week.
</P>
<P>
Only 11 young Muslims came to the first meeting in October. Now,
the imam looks out at a room full of faces.
</P>
<P>
"Sixty and counting," he said.
