A Novel Take on Spitzer
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
perversely they thought -- that unrelenting virtue is not just
unrealistic but uninteresting.
</P>
<P>
Gatsby, I reminded them, is a damned fool who falls in love with
a woman unworthy of his affection. Because he's blind, he does
everything wrong, and we sympathize because we, too, have been
blind and done things wrong. Granted, Huck Finn is an innocent,
uncorrupted (as yet) by a depraved world, but he's never more
interesting than when he's convinced of his own depravity. We
like him right from the start, but when he says, "OK, I'll go to
hell"  -- that's when we fall in love.
</P>
<P>
For most people, mine is a losing argument, and one night
recently, as I stayed up watching television coverage of Eliot
Spitzer's disgrace, I found myself losing it all over again as
the media turned a complex drama into a simple story line: Now
that he's no longer their unsullied white knight, Spitzer must be
a complete hypocrite. Later, I lay awake in the dark thinking
about how a novel about Eliot Spitzer might go and what kind of
novel it would be.
</P>
<P>
My fictional Eliot would be complex, would contain paradoxes. He
would not be a hypocrite. My Eliot would believe with his whole
heart in his crusades against the corrupt and the powerful and
the privileged, even as he worked studiously to undermine his
legacy. Fiction can accommodate such paradoxes, provided they're
explained.
</P>
<P>
But I don't mean to jigger the facts; fictive Eliot will do
exactly what the real Eliot has done, only my guy almost never
imagines getting caught. And when he does occasionally consider
the possibility, he trusts that there will be ample warning that
disaster is imminent. For the most part, things in his life have
happened slowly, especially the good things, and he trusts that
bad things will evolve similarly. He will swerve at the last
moment. The possibility of a head-on collision, swift and
devastating, simply never occurs to him.
</P>
<P>
Even worse, though he knows that the world doesn't work this way,
he convinces himself that if he's caught, people will treat him
fairly. Sure, he has shamed himself, but he's done a lot of good
things, too, and people will remember that. He has always
employed a kind of moral arithmetic, and he'll expect that same
math to be applied to him -- all his virtues set up on one side
of the ledger, his one weakness on the other. People will
understand that he's mostly good. By the time my Eliot realizes
that he's wrong about all this, it's too late. The damage is
done. He has betrayed his wife, his children, his best self, and
it's all his fault.
</P>
<P>
OK, that's my thumbnail fictional Eliot; a little thin, and maybe
I like him too much. Not giving his nasty, righteous streak
enough play. It's possible I'm giving him more credit than God
would, but then God has the advantage of knowing what Eliot and I
are still trying to figure out. I'll learn more as I write, but
there are other characters to consider.
</P>
<P>
First, Eliot's wife -- and here I sense a mystery even deeper
than the mystery of Eliot himself. Why does she stand there
beside him at the podium when he confesses? Why do they all? I
feel uniquely unqualified to look inside her heart, to ferret out
her motives. I make a list of what I know (not much) and what I
suspect (not much more) and wonder whether imagination will fill
in all those blanks. I'm relatively certain of one thing: It's
not this woman's fault. I won't portray her as frigid or
otherwise complicit in what has transpired. She hasn't driven
Eliot to any of this. I don't believe in perfection, but I've
decided for the time being that she's been a good wife, a good
mother.
</P>
<P>
What I know about marriage is that identities over time tend to
merge. Eliot's wife was once her own person, but down the years
she's lost some of that individuality, surrendered it willingly,
never suspecting she might have further use for it. If she's not
this man's wife, then who is she? Worse, can she abandon her
husband without implying that her daughters should do the same to
their father? And what was that promise that she made? For better
or for worse? Did she mean that or just say it? How could it be
that she was able to imagine the "better" so vividly, the "worse"
not at all? Was that his fault for leaving so few clues, or hers
for ignoring the few there were? The facts of her situation are
simple and clear. Why aren't her emotions? Why won't they stand
still so she can examine them?
</P>
<P>
And what of those daughters? This is the hardest part for my
Eliot. What really tears him apart is that when the news breaks,
these girls are going to have to go to school. He sees them in
his mind's eye now and can think of little else. Sees them alone
and isolated, all the other kids talking about them, growing
silent when his girls walk into the room. This won't go on
forever, but to them it will seem like forever. Eliot also fears
that he's done them long-term damage. Some of it can be repaired.
They're good, smart girls, and they won't grow up hating all men.
But their innocence has fled; they look at him now like a man
wearing a partially removed disguise. Never again will they take
anything on faith. They will be cautious in the living of their
lives, taking nothing at face value. They'll brace for impact
when there's no reason. He could have spared them all this, yet
managed not to.
</P>
<P>
The novel's getting pretty dark, and that worries me. Time for a
little comic relief. Real-life Eliot has few friends, we're told,
the natural result of what some people like to call his
arrogance, though my Eliot has never thought of it in those terms
until now. Arrogant? He'd simply tried to put criminals in jail
where they belonged. Wasn't that his job? Is that any reason he
should be friendless now? So I'll give my Eliot one friend,
someone to help him put what he's done into perspective. I'll
give this friend some of my own cynical humor. Ah, what the hell,
I'll give him my name. Call him Rick. I can change that later
with a keystroke.
</P>
<P>
Before everything begins to unravel, Eliot confides to Rick that
he's made a mess of things, betrayed everyone he loves, that he
isn't even sure who he is anymore. But Rick will tell him not to
be melodramatic. It's true that he's made mistakes, big ones,
Rick explains, but they aren't what Eliot thinks they are. Rick
admits he's outraged that Eliot has spent $80,000 on prostitutes,
because it shouldn't cost that much to get a little action in
America. It's like one of those $500 Pentagon hammers. Downright
wasteful. And why order a hammer from New Jersey and pay the
shipping? There are perfectly good hammers in Washington -- it's
a damned city of hammers, when you think about it. Where on earth
did Eliot get the idea that New Jersey hammers were superior? All
he wanted to do was nail something, right?
</P>
<P>
Don't joke, Eliot tells Rick. This isn't funny; he could go to
jail. But to Rick's way of thinking, that's the biggest joke of
all. Your average CEO can claim millions in salary and stock
options in the same year his company is going down the tubes, and
it's all perfectly legal. You want to know what you're really
guilty of, Eliot? Cluelessness. You didn't forget who you are,
you forgot where you are. This is America, pal, where you can
lead the nation into war on false pretenses and be rewarded with
a second term in office, but where illicit sex is and has always
been an impeachable offense. (Note to self: A little of this Rick
character goes a long way.)
</P>
<P>
How will my Eliot's story end? Do I wait for real-life events to
unfold or make something up? What kind of story will it be? A
tragedy? Maybe, but somehow I don't think so.
</P>
<P>
My Eliot's no Gatsby, and there's no reason he should wind up
floating face-down in the pool. What he's really done is blown
it. He's had a great opportunity, and he's blown it. There will
be both private and public consequences. He will be punished, and
he will punish himself. He will survive. So will his family.
People do. What is the basis for such breezy optimism? Well, for
one, there's historical precedent. Hillary Clinton wasn't done in
by her knucklehead husband. I wouldn't pretend to know what's in
her heart, but she's clearly functioning. And Chelsea, God love
her, seems to have weathered the effects of her old man's late-
onset adolescence.
</P>
<P>
I cannot speak for the real Eliot, but some part of my Eliot has
known all along that he's no saint, that he's not anybody's best
hope, not even his own. He knows this even as some other part of
him believes what people are telling him because, of course, he
wants to. This has been his true conflict all along, and finally,
explosively, it has been resolved. -0-
