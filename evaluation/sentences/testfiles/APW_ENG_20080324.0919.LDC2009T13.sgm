Al-Qaida No. 2 calls on Muslims to strike US, Jewish interests to
avenge Gaza violence

Al-Qaida No. 2 Ayman al-Zawahri called on Muslims to strike
Jewish and American targets anywhere in the world in revenge for
Israel's offensive in the Gaza Strip in an audiotape Monday, part
of a new push by the terror network to use anger over the
violence to rally support.
</P>
<P>
The al-Zawahri tape came just days after two messages from Osama
bin Laden, who called for a holy war to liberate the Palestinian
territories and warned of a "severe" reaction against Europe over
the recent publishing of cartoons seen as insulting Islam's
Prophet Muhammad in Danish newspapers.
</P>
<P>
The string of messages has raised fears al-Qaida could be
planning new attacks against Israel or in the West -- or is
seeking to inspire its sympathizers to carry out violence. In
another message last week, bin Laden warned of a "severe"
reaction against Europe after Danish papers published a cartoon
seen as insulting Islam's Prophet Muhammad.
</P>
<P>
But the new tapes may have another broader goal -- to show
supporters and the West that it can extend its operations and
open a new front against Israel.
</P>
<P>
Bin Laden and al-Zawahri have frequently referred to the
Palestinian cause in their past messages, usually in broader
terms of liberating Jerusalem and denouncing Israeli violence.
But al-Qaida is not known to have a direct presence in Israel or
the Palestinian territories, though Israeli and Palestinian
officials have at times warned it is seeking to.
</P>
<P>
Al-Qaida sympathizers have often posted messages on Islamic
militant Web forums asking why the terror network has not
attacked Israel on its soil or gotten more involved on the
Palestinian front.
</P>
<P>
Bruce Hoffman, a counterterrorism expert, said that with al-Qaida
in Iraq suffering setbacks, al-Qaida "has to look further afield
and at least give an impression of an upward trajectory, that its
operating across the Middle East."
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that Al-Qaida's media arm, Al-Sahab, has
dramatically stepped up its output of audio and video tapes,
issuing an average of one every three days in 2007, more than
double the 2006 rate. "There comes a time when you have to back
up your words," said Hoffman, a professor at Washington's
Georgetown University. "With the increased drumbeat of
propoaganda ... it becomes an element of necessity, if you're
talking so much you have to do something."
</P>
<P>
"Perhaps they don't have the ability to attack the United States,
so they may turn to the next best enemy, either Israel or
Europe," he said.
</P>
<P>
Al-Zawahri's call for attacks had a more immediate and urgent
tone than past messages -- and he said attacks should not be
limited to Israeli or Palestinian territory.
</P>
<P>
"Muslims, today is your day. Strike the interests of the Jews,
the Americans, and all those who participated in the attack on
Muslims," al-Zawahri said in the 4 minute, 44-second audiotape.
"Monitor the targets, collect money, prepare the equipment, plan
with precision, and then -- while relying on God -- assault,
seeking martyrdom and paradise."
</P>
<P>
"Today there is no room for he who says that we should only fight
the Jews in Palestine," he said. "Let us strike their interests
everywhere, just like they gathered against us from everywhere."
</P>
<P>
"Let them know that they will get blood for every dollar they
spend in the killing of the Muslims, and for every bullet they
fire at us, a volcano will turn back on them," he said, referring
to American military aid and other ties to Israel. "They cannot
expect to support Israel, then live in peace while the Jews are
killing our fugitive and besieged people."
</P>
<P>
The authenticity of Monday's tape could not be independently
confirmed. But the voice on it resembled that of al-Zawahri on
previous audio and videotapes confirmed to be his. It was posted
on an Islamic militant Web site where al-Qaida usually releases
its statements, and a banner advertising the tape had the logo of
Al-Sahab.
</P>
<P>
Israeli officials declined to comment on the new tape. Israel
launched a weeklong offensive in Gaza that ended in early March,
seeking to put down Palestinian militants firing rockets against
nearby Israeli towns. The Israeli assault killed more than 120
people, including many civilians, and caused heavy damage -- all
aired prominently on Arab satellite TV news networks.
</P>
<P>
The only previous attack blamed on al-Qaida specifically
targeting Israelis was a 2002 suicide bombing of a hotel full of
Israelis in Mombasa, Kenya that killed 16 people and a
simultaneous failed attempt to shoot down an Israeli passenger
plane taking off from the city with rockets.
</P>
<P>
Al-Zawahri also denounced Arab leaders he accused of supporting
Israel -- pointing to Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Jordan, suggesting
they too could be targets.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian-born al-Zawahri accused Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak of colluding with Israel in the siege of Gaza. Egypt has
sealed its border with the Gaza Strip since the Palestinian
militant group Hamas took over the territory last year.
</P>
<P>
He said Mubarak "repeats the same dirty role" as the Lebanese
Phalangists -- a Christian militia that was allied with Israel in
Lebanon's 1975-1990 civil war and was blamed in the massacre of
Palestinian refugees in the Beirut camps of Sabra and Shatila.
"The roles are the same, even if the faces change -- the same
betrayal even if the names have changed," said al-Zawahri.
