<P>
A rape defendant who stabbed his lawyer during jury selection
returned to court in the northeastern U.S. state of Massachusetts
under heavy security and aggressively asked the attorney: "You
still breathing?"
</P>
<P>
"It didn't mean anything to me," lawyer John Courtney told his
former client, Che Sosa, on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Courtney has withdrawn from the trial of Sosa, who attacked him
Tuesday with a weapon made of hard plastic. Superior Court Judge
Charles Grabau also excused himself from the case because he
witnessed it.
</P>
<P>
Sosa, 37, lunged at Courtney before court officers restrained
him. Courtney was treated for injuries to his face and chest.
</P>
<P>
"I guess I was lucky," Courtney said. "It hit the bone."
</P>
<P>
Officers in helmets, gloves and padded chest protectors led a
handcuffed and shackled Sosa to his court appearance Thursday. He
was wearing leg irons in court Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
A Department of Correction spokeswoman said Sosa was strip
searched in his high-security cell Thursday before he was handed
over to deputies.
</P>
<P>
State police are investigating how Sosa managed to bring a weapon
into court.
