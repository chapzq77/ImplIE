BANGKOK, Thailand 2007-11-01 04:49:48 UTC

Police issued an arrest warrant Thursday for a suspected Canadian
pedophile accused of sexually abusing several children, including
an 8-year-old boy he allegedly lured to his hotel room in the
Thai beach town of Pattaya.
</P>
<P>
The arrest warrant for Orville Frank Mader, 54, was issued after
the boy told police he had been sexually abused by the Canadian,
police Lt. Sompol Nakkumpan said. Police believe he abused at
least three other boys.
</P>
<P>
"We are looking all over Pattaya for this man," Sompol said.
"It's a small town and we will find him sooner or later."
Immigration police at border crossing points and airports have
been alerted in case Mader attempts to leave the country, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The case comes just weeks after a worldwide manhunt for another
suspected pedophile ended with the arrest of Canadian Christopher
Paul Neil in Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Neil has been charged with child sexual abuse. Police found about
200 pictures on the Internet of Thai, Cambodian and Vietnamese
boys being sexually abused by a man whose face was digitally
obscured. German police computer experts unscrambled the photos
so the man's face was recognizable and tip-offs led Interpol to
identify Neil as a suspect.
</P>
<P>
Neil and Mader frequented some of the same places, including a
hotel in Pattaya, police said.
</P>
<P>
Pattaya, a popular tourist destination, is known for its beaches,
thriving sex industry and high crime rate.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, police said they may begin making background checks
on foreign teachers in Thailand after arresting two teachers on
pornography-related charges in less than two weeks.
</P>
<P>
"It shouldn't be enough to wear white shirts and have a
university degree. We need to know their background," said police
Col. Apichart Suribunya, head of Thailand's liaison office for
Interpol, the international police agency.
</P>
<P>
Paul Cornelius Jones, 39, who has lived in Thailand for seven
years, was arrested Tuesday after police raided his Bangkok
apartment and found a computer containing hundreds of photos of
naked boys and girls, Apichart said.
</P>
<P>
Jones -- who had been working as a teacher at a Bangkok private
school -- was arrested after a tip-off from British counterparts,
police said.
</P>
<P>
Jones, of Cardiff, Wales, has been charged with distributing
pornographic photographs of children under age 15, which carries
a maximum penalty of 15 years in prison, Apichart said.
</P>
<P>
Several Southeast Asian countries are popular among pedophiles
and sex abusers because of poverty that drives children and their
parents to accept money for sexual favors, and sometimes because
of lax law enforcement.
