Johnny Frigo, a versatile jazz violinist and bassist who toured
with Jimmy Dorsey and wrote a jazz standard recorded by Billie
Holiday and Sarah Vaughn, has died, according to his son. He was
90.
</P>
<P>
Frigo died early Wednesday at a Chicago hospital after battling
cancer in recent years, said his son Rick Frigo.
</P>
<P>
Johnny Frigo was born on Chicago's South Side and spent much of
his career playing bass. After playing with the U.S. Coast Guard
band at Ellis Island during World War II, he toured with
clarinetist Jimmy Dorsey and his orchestra. Around that time,
Frigo wrote "Detour Ahead," a song that became a jazz standard
recorded by Holiday and Vaughn, among others.
</P>
<P>
He was in his late 60s or early 70s when he turned his attention
to the violin, appearing twice on "The Tonight Show" with Johnny
Carson.
</P>
<P>
"Nobody played violin like him," said his son. "Chicago's a
poorer place without him."
</P>
<P>
Frigo was also a poet and artist with a keen sense of humor, his
son said. When Carson asked him why he'd waited so long to launch
his jazz violin career, he replied that he did not want there to
be enough time for him to become a has-been, his son said.

<P>
Frigo is survived by his son; wife Brittney Brown; and younger
sister Aurora Bray.
