Toms shakes off sore back, poor form to shoot 67 for Wachovia
Championship lead

David Toms overcame a sore back and some recent poor form with a
5-under 67 Thursday to take the first-round lead at the Wachovia
Championship.
</P>
<P>
It was Toms' best round since before he can remember.
</P>
<P>
"Since a long time. I don't know. I can't even think," Toms said.
"It makes me feel good about my game. It gives me a little bit of
confidence. It wasn't a fluke round."
</P>
<P>
Playing in the morning when the greens were still soft from the
drenching rain earlier in the week, Toms made eight birdies,
including a near ace at the 13th hole, to take a one-shot lead
over Phil Mickelson and Jason Bohn.
</P>
<P>
It was a welcome change for the 2001 U.S. PGA Championship
winner, whose last victory was more than two years ago. Swinging
too hard two months ago at the Match Play Championship caused a
disk problem to flare up. He followed that withdrawal with two
missed cuts while on pain medication, shot an 80 in the final
round of the Masters, and tied for 61st at the Verizon Heritage.
</P>
<P>
"I've been out here long enough that the only time it's really
fun for me is when I have a chance to win and contend in
tournaments," said Toms, a 12-time tour winner. "Grinding to make
the cut is too much like work. Playing well, I obviously enjoy
that a lot more."
</P>
<P>
Mickelson, in his first tournament since the Masters, showed off
his new, longer putter in shooting a 68. Mickelson hit 12 of 14
fairways and had only 26 putts.
</P>
<P>
"I haven't had as much soreness after the round in my back,"
Mickelson said. "I haven't had any back problems, but just
muscular, sore. I think not having to bend over as much might
allow me to practice a little bit easier."
</P>
<P>
Bohn, like Toms and Mickelson, had an early tee time. He made six
birdies in a satisfying round as he works his way back from
stress fractures in his ribs suffered last year at the Memorial.
</P>
<P>
"I'm 100 percent healthy and I'm still trying to shake a little
of the rust off my golf game," Bohn said.
</P>
<P>
Zach Johnson and Ben Curtis led a group of nine two shots back,
while Vijay Singh and Rory Sabbatini were among 11 three off the
lead at 70. No one was able to make a charge late in the day on
Toms as the course dried out and the greens quickened.
</P>
<P>
It was another rough day for Masters champion Trevor Immelman.
After missing the cut last week at the Byron Nelson Championship,
Immelman shot 76 and was buried at the bottom of the leader
board.
