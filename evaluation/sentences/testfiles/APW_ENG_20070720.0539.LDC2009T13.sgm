Taiwan presidential candidate takes off on key US visit

TAIPEI, Taiwan 2007-07-20 09:04:47 UTC

<P>
Taiwanese presidential candidate Frank Hsieh set off on a 10-day
visit to the United States Friday, expected to provide American
officials a firsthand opportunity to hear his views on the key
issue of relations with rival China.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh's trip comes against the background of rising unease in
Washington over plans by Taiwanese President Chen Shui-bian to
hold a referendum on Taiwan's entry into the United Nations under
its own name, a move that has been broadly condemned by Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh won the presidential nomination of Chen's Democratic
Progressive Party in May, and is set to face Ma Ying-jeou of the
main opposition Nationalists in the presidential poll next March.
</P>
<P>
Analysts believe his cross-strait views are more moderate than
those of Chen, who has made no secret of his desire to formalize
Taiwan's de facto independence.
</P>
<P>
Although Taiwan and China split amid civil war in 1949, Beijing
continues to view the island as part of its territory and has
threatened to attack if it ever makes the break permanent.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh spokesman Sky Chao said the main purpose of Hsieh's trip
was to open communication channels with the United States and to
develop confidence between the Hsieh camp and official
Washington.
</P>
<P>
"In the past it was unavoidable that U.S. and Taiwan had
different stands on issues, and communications did not go well,"
he said. "We hope this time we can remedy that situation."
</P>
<P>
Chao declined to say who Hsieh planned to meet in the U.S.
capital, but Taiwanese media have reported one of his
interlocutors will be Undersecretary of State Nicholas Burns.
</P>
<P>
The American Institute in Taiwan -- the de facto U.S. Embassy on
the island -- would not provide details on Hsieh's Washington
itinerary.
</P>
<P>
Tai-shuenn Yang of Taipei's Chinese Culture University said
American officials were anxious to hear if Hsieh was really more
moderate than Chen on cross-strait relations.
</P>
<P>
"In the past few years, President Chen has taken some
unpredictable steps, and the U.S. is concerned whether the new
DPP leader will continue in (his path)," he said. "The U.S. wants
to know enough to be able to make objective assessment about the
2008 elections."
</P>
<P>
In February 2006 Chen scrapped a government body responsible for
eventual unification with the mainland, infuriating Beijing, and
causing great concern in Washington, which fears being drawn into
a conflict in the western Pacific.
</P>
<P>
His determination to move ahead with the U.N referendum is
causing similar concern, because it appears to signal a desire to
dispense with Taiwan's official title of "The Republic of China,"
and carve out a long-term identity separate from the mainland.
</P>
<P>
As Hsieh's campaign begins to gather momentum, he may be torn
between the demands of hardcore DPP supporters to identify with
the pro-independence line, and the preference of centrist voters
to continue the island's politically ambivalent status quo.
</P>
<P>
It will not be an easy balancing act for the 61-year-old lawyer,
who as mayor of the southern city of Kaohsiung from 1998 to 2005
pushed for exchanges with the nearby Chinese city of Xiamen and
tried to promote better relations with Beijing under the slogan
"coexistence and reconciliation."
