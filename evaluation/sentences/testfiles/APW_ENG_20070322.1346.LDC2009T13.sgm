An extremely rare species of owl discovered in 1976, and known
only from a few specimens caught in nets after dark, has been
seen in the wild for the first time, the American Bird
Conservancy said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The long-whiskered owlet, one of the world's smallest owls, was
spotted in February by researchers monitoring a private
conservation area in Peru's northern jungle.
</P>
<P>
The conservancy said that the sighting "is considered a holy
grail of South American ornithology."
</P>
<P>
Photos provided by the conservancy show a bright-eyed bird not
much bigger than the fist of the person holding it.
</P>
<P>
It is so distinct that it has been named in its own genus,
"Xenoglaux," meaning "strange owl," due to the long wispy
feathers or whiskers that stream out from its wild-looking
reddish-orange eyes.
</P>
<P>
The owl inhabits the dense undergrowth of highland forests in a
remote region of Peru.
</P>
<P>
"Seeing the long-whiskered owlet is a huge thrill," said David
Geale of Asociacion Ecosistemas Andinos, who was a member of the
research team. "Its population is estimated to be less than 1,000
birds and possibly as few as 250."
</P>
<P>
He said the species is endangered by the rapid destruction of its
forest habitat and its small range.
</P>
<P>
The conservancy said in a news release that investigators
encountered the owlet three times during daylight hours and
recorded its calls frequently at night.
</P>
<P>
The researchers captured a bird in a mist-net and later released
it onto a tree branch, where it was photographed before
disappearing into the night.
