US, Israel claim peace talks progress despite settlements by
Lachlan Carmichael

<P>
The United States and Israel said on Tuesday that Israeli-
Palestinian peace talks were making progress despite what the
Jewish state referred to as its small and limited settlement
activities.Visiting US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and
her Israeli counterpart Tzipi Livni both struck upbeat notes
despite the lack of tangible progress in a peace process launched
last November in the United States.
</P>
<P>
"We continue to find the way to reach an agreement between Israel
and the Palestinians," Livni, flanked by Rice, told reporters at
a brief news conference. "Even in these hectic days we continue
to negotiate."
</P>
<P>
Amid jockeying for power in Israel, Rice was making her first
visit since Prime Minister Ehud Olmert said on July 30 that he
will resign to battle corruption charges after his Kadima party
chooses a new leader in September.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Livni, who leads Israel's negotiating team with
the Palestinians, is a front-runner to replace him, as is
Transport Minister Shaul Mofaz, a hawkish former general.
</P>
<P>
Rice said progress was being made despite difficulties, and she
was "very heartened by the fact that the negotiations are serious
and they are intensive.
</P>
<P>
"In fact I believe that the parties have succeeded in moving
their understandings of what needs to be achieved and indeed
their positions somewhat closer together over this period of
time," Rice said.
</P>
<P>
But in the latest sign of the difficulties faced by the talks the
Israeli settlement watchdog Peace Now released a report saying
that construction of settlements in the occupied territories has
doubled since last year.
</P>
<P>
"Construction in the settlements has increased by a factor of 1.8
by comparison to the same period last year," the group said in a
report, citing government statistics.
</P>
<P>
"The housing ministry initiated 433 new housing units during the
period of January to May 2008, compared to just 240 units during
the period January to May 2007," it said.
</P>
<P>
The international community considers all settlement projects in
the occupied territories to be illegal and the Palestinians have
repeatedly said that the expansion of settlements is the greatest
obstacle to peace.
</P>
<P>
Livni played down the impact of the activity.
</P>
<P>
"I would like to suggest to my partners not to use it as an
excuse and I know they are not using it as an excuse but I
understand their frustration sometimes," Israel's top diplomat
said.
</P>
<P>
"But at the end of the day the Israeli government's policy is not
to expand settlements, not to build new settlements and not to
confiscate Palestinian land," she said.
</P>
<P>
"There were some small activities but they will not influence the
ability (to negotiate), nor the future of the future borders of
the Palestinian state."
</P>
<P>
Rice again said the settlements were "unhelpful" to the peace
process because they could prejudice the outcome of negotiations
aimed at determining the borders of a future Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
"In fact what we need now are steps that enhance confidence
between the parties and that anything that undermines confidence
between the parties ought to be avoided," Rice said.
</P>
<P>
"And we will continue to press ahead to get agreement so that we
know what is in Israel and what is Palestinian," she said.
</P>
<P>
Rice left the news conference for talks with Livni and former
Palestinian prime minister Ahmed Qorei, who heads the Palestinian
negotiating team, before meeting Palestinian president Mahmud
Abbas in the West Bank.
