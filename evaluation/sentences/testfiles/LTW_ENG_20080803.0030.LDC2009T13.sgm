Anthrax Victims Reflect on Possible Resolution of the Case
</HEADLINE>

WASHINGTON
</P>
<P>
There are times, especially when he's struggling to walk uphill,
that Leroy Richmond can almost feel the anthrax that nearly
killed him in 2001. He senses how it saps his 64-year-old body of
strength, how it forces him to rest for two or three minutes.
</P>
<P>
And now with reports that government scientist Bruce E. Ivins,
who died last week of an apparent suicide, has been linked by
authorities to the anthrax attacks, Richmond has another feeling.
</P>
<P>
He feels like this is the end of the mystery.
</P>
<P>
"I am totally relieved. This brings a lot of closure," said
Richmond, a former Washington, D.C., postal worker who retired
after the 2001 attacks. "It may not have brought the closure that
others may have wanted, to see this person face justice as
opposed to take his own life ... but I think they have the right
person."
</P>
<P>
Authorities were preparing to file criminal charges against
Ivins, 62, a scientist at the U.S. Army Medical Research
Institute of Infectious Diseases at Fort Detrick, Md., when he
died Tuesday of a massive dose of prescription medication. The
U.S. Justice Department said Friday there had been "significant
developments in the investigation," but declined to comment on
the focus on Ivins, which was first reported by the Los Angeles
Times Thursday. Documents in the case are under court seal, and a
department spokesman said Saturday there were no plans to ask a
judge to unseal them this weekend.
</P>
<P>
Victims of the anthrax attacks, which killed five people,
expressed mixed emotions to the case's surprising developments.
Richmond's certainty was offset by the wait-and-see attitude of
Mary Morris, whose husband, Thomas Morris Jr., died from the
lethal powder that seeped out of letters processed at the postal
facility where he and Richmond worked.
</P>
<P>
And the lawyer for the family of another victim, Bob Stevens,
said they felt both vindicated at the apparent confirmation of
their belief that a government biodefense worker was behind the
attacks, and suspicious that Ivins might be a fall-guy in a
bungled investigation.
</P>
<P>
"He fits the profile that we had advanced, but they would like to
see the evidence," said Richard D. Schuler, of West Palm Beach,
Fla. He has filed a lawsuit, pending in the Florida Supreme
Court, seeking damages from the government for the wife and three
children of Stevens, a photo editor for the Sun tabloid, who died
after inhaling anthrax sent to the Boca Raton, Fla., offices of
American Media Inc.
</P>
<P>
"The family definitely wants to be able to see the evidence that
the FBI has accumulated, that they're not just trying to make
this guy a scapegoat ... allowing them to close their file and be
done with it," Schuler said.
</P>
<P>
The Times reported Saturday that Ivins was listed as the co-
inventor on two patents for an anthrax vaccine and stood to gain
financially from federal spending on vaccines in the aftermath of
the deadly anthrax attacks.
</P>
<P>
But Morris, who now lives in Beach Park, Ill., said she still
wasn't ready to jump to any conclusions.
</P>
<P>
"I am just like Joe Friday. He said, `Just the facts. Just the
facts,'" Morris said. "So we gather the facts and then we ponder
the facts and ... we just wait and see what develops."
</P>
<P>
Although the death of her husband is with her every day, she said
she forgives whoever was responsible. She also feels for Ivins
family.
</P>
<P>
"My head and my heart (say) that saying anything detrimental,
unkind toward this man only hurts his family because they're the
ones left to sort through and to wade through all of this,"
Morris said. "We have to remember they lost someone they loved
also."
</P>
<P>
Richmond, of Stafford, Va., said a money motive sounds
"plausible." But he would like to hear details of the case from
the authorities.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Richmond deals with the fatigue and short-term
memory loss he said the anthrax still causes him. But until the
recent reports, he thought about the attacks only when he felt
the lingering physical affects.
</P>
<P>
"Those are the only times when I consider the fact that this is
not normal," he said. "This is not the type of person I was seven
years (ago)."
</P>
<P>
Richmond said he talked with his friend Morris on the phone
Friday, praying together and reflecting on a past they know
cannot be changed by any new investigative developments.
</P>
<P>
"This is like the final chapter," he said. "This is the like the
end for us."
