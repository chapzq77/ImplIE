Defending a `Wide Stance' Requires a Thick Wallet

<P>
Add this to the list of indignities Sen. Larry Craig, R-Idaho,
has suffered since getting busted in an airport restroom last
June: He now has to pay his legal dream team out of his own
pocket.
</P>
<P>
Per the Senate Ethics Committee's Feb. 13 "admonition" of him for
his guilty plea to disorderly conduct charges, Craig has not paid
any of his top-flight lawyers from his campaign committee since
early February. The last legal payment from Craig for U.S.
Senate, in the form of an $80,695 check, went out on Feb. 3 to
Billy Martin's firm of Sutherland Asbill &amp; Brennan.
</P>
<P>
According to reports his campaign committee filed with the
Federal Election Commission, that put Craig's total legal tab at
more than $407,000 since he was arrested June 11 at the
Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport in an undercover sting
designed to root out lewd behavior.
</P>
<P>
But Craig never sought permission from the Ethics Committee to
use his campaign funds to pay Martin and Stan Brand, the lawyer
who helped him handle the matter before the committee.
</P>
<P>
The panel's three-page letter concluded that Craig had engaged in
"improper conduct which has reflected discreditably on the
Senate" and warned him against any future legal expenses because
the senator's arrest may not have "occurred in connection with
your official duties."
</P>
<P>
Craig's office declined to comment. Brand told "On the Hill" this
week that Craig is now in "full compliance" with the ethics
admonishment. "I'm paid in full," Brand added, noting that his
work for Craig concluded once the committee finished its
deliberations.
</P>
<P>
But Craig is continuing his appeal of a Minnesota court ruling
that upheld his guilty plea, and he is continuing to rack up
legal bills with Martin's firm. He is left to fight this uphill
battle with his own finances -- which are incredibly meager.
</P>
<P>
Aside from a pair of retirement accounts, Craig has just one
other account to draw from. It's with the Senate's federal credit
union and contains between $50,000 and $100,000, according to a
financial disclosure report filed with the Senate.
