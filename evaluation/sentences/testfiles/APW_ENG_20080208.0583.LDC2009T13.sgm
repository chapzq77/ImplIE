Ciba Specialty Chemicals AG said Friday its fourth-quarter net
profit was flat due to restructuring and tax charges.

Net earnings for the October-December quarter were 84 million
Swiss francs (US$76 million; euro52.2 million), the same as for
the year-earlier period.

Sales rose 2 percent to 1.58 billion francs (US$1.43 billion;
euro980 million) from 1.55 billion in the fourth quarter of 2006.

The Basel-based producer of chemicals to enhance plastics, paper,
automobiles, buildings and other products said sales in Asia grew
strongly, while business in Europe and the Americas was largely
unchanged.

Full-year net profits reached 237 million francs (US$214.6
million; euro147.3 million), compared with a net loss of 41
million francs in 2006, the company said.

Ciba shares were up 2.25 percent at 43.72 francs (US$39.57;
