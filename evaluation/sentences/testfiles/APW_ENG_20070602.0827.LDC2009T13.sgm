Sweden was awarded a 3-0 win Saturday over Denmark in a European
Championship qualifier after a Danish fan tried to attack the
referee for giving a late penalty.
</P>
<P>
Denmark had rallied from 3-0 down to level at 3-3 when German
referee Herbert Fandel sent off Denmark defender Christian
Poulsen in the 89th for punching striker Markus Rosenberg in the
stomach.

<P>
A spectator ran toward Fandel, but was intercepted by Danish
players. The referee and the linesman then walked off the pitch.
