McCain tours Mexican Catholic shrine, ends journey to promote
free-trade with U.S. neighbors

WASHINGTON 2008-07-03 15:39:49 UTC
</P>
<P>
John McCain was discussing the thorny issue of immigration
Thursday with Mexican President Felipe Calderon, as the
Republican presidential candidate wrapped up a three-day visit to
Colombia and Mexico designed to promote free trade and burnish
his foreign policy credentials.
</P>
<P>
McCain, whose home state of Arizona borders Mexico, began the day
at Mexico City's famed Basilica de Guadalupe, the country's
holiest site for Catholics. Hispanics and Catholics are expected
to be key swing voters in the November election against Democrat
Barack Obama, who has also worked to woo the same groups.
</P>
<P>
The Republican received a blessing from the basilica's monsignor.
McCain also laid a wreath of white roses at the altar and stood
atop the Papal balcony there. He was accompanied by President
George W. Bush's brother, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, who was
visiting Mexico on a business trip.
</P>
<P>
McCain was meeting with Calderon to discuss illegal immigration,
a key issue for Hispanic voters but a sore subject for many
conservative voters who oppose efforts to allow some of the
roughly 11 million such immigrants to eventually gain U.S.
citizenship. McCain backs increased security along the
U.S.-Mexico border to block the flow of undocumented workers.
</P>
<P>
Both Obama and McCain have been reaching to the center to appeal
to undecided moderate voters, who are more likely to be Hispanic,
Catholic and married with children than other voters. A recent
AP-Yahoo News poll finds that 15 percent call themselves
moderates and are not solidly supporting a candidate.
</P>
<P>
Some 39 percent of voters called themselves Democratic, 29
percent Republican, and 32 percent independent in the June 13-23
survey. That Democratic edge suggests Obama may be less dependent
on votes in the middle than McCain, but still the likeliest path
to the White House cuts through the center of the electorate.
</P>
<P>
Obama on Thursday was holding a town hall meeting with veterans
in Fargo, North Dakota to discuss better treatment and benefits
for military veterans and their families. His campaign has
focused on patriotic themes leading up to Friday's Independence
Day holiday.
</P>
<P>
McCain, meanwhile, was unexpectedly put on the defensive at a
news conference in Cartagena, Colombia, on Wednesday, when he was
forced to respond to a claim by a Republican Senate colleague
that the presidential candidate had roughed up an associate of
Nicaragua's leftist President Daniel Ortega two decades ago.
</P>
<P>
"Simply not true," McCain said of the allegation by Mississippi
Republican Sen. Thad Cochran. The two have been deeply at odds
over federal spending. McCain's campaign has been dogged by
latent concerns about his hot temper.
</P>
<P>
Cochran aide Margaret McPhillips said the senator went into
detail about the incident in an interview with a Mississippi
newspaper to "make the point that, though Sen. McCain has had
problems with his temper, he has overcome them."
</P>
<P>
In Colombia, McCain praised the country's conservative president
for squeezing drug barons, toured a harbor to watch narcotics
interdiction programs and spoke out for free trade agreements
with Washington's neighbors in the Western Hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
The trade pacts have emerged as a sensitive subject in the U.S.,
as Americans grapple with soaring energy costs, a crumbling
mortgage and housing market and growing unemployment. Unimpeded
hemispheric trade is an area of sharp contrasts between the
presidential rivals, with McCain blasting Obama for opposing
existing treaties while leaving himself open to criticism from
voters worried about outsourcing of U.S. jobs.
</P>
<P>
McCain has promoted himself as better equipped than Obama to deal
with foreign policy issues and used his trip to Colombia to press
President Alvaro Uribe to work to improve his country's human
rights record. But he also praised Plan Colombia, a program the
U.S. government launched 10 years ago to reduce cocaine
production in the country.
</P>
<P>
Obama this week has been campaigning on issues meant to combat
impressions he is elitist and not patriotic. He prodded Americans
to greater public service work and promoted the use of additional
federal funds to religious groups that tackle social problems.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday the Democrat stood before a boisterous University of
Colorado crowd -- in Colorado Springs, a city known as a bastion
of conservatism -- and said that the quiet following Friday's
Independence Day holiday would be a good time for every person to
consider how they can contribute "to our most pressing national
challenges" -- whether in the military, overseas or just next
door.
</P>
<P>
Obama's choice of Christian conservative Colorado Springs for his
visit showed the degree to which he is courting Republican
religious voters and trying to make McCain compete for their
affections.
</P>
<P>
The Illinois senator spoke about the expansion of government
national service programs, which he first unveiled in December,
that would cost $3.5 billion a year. His campaign said he would
fund the spending with some of the savings from ending the war in
Iraq and by canceling a new tax break for multinational
corporations.
</P>
<P>
Other highlights include increasing the all-volunteer military
and doubling the size of the Peace Corps.
</P>
<P>
Obama's call echoed George W. Bush's "love a neighbor like you'd
like to be loved yourself," an enduring staple of the Republican
president's political speeches of the last eight years.
</P>
<P>
His campaign said the focus on service was meant not to recall
Bush but to reach back to President John F. Kennedy's generation-
captivating address that urged Americans to ask what they can do
for their country instead of what the U.S. can do for them, or
President Bill Clinton's legacy of creating AmeriCorps to tackle
U.S. poverty issues.
</P>
<P>
Obama also addressed the United Steel Workers union's annual
conference in Las Vegas via satellite and burnishing his appeal
to the military with a planned visit to the U.S. Air Force
Academy and Peterson Air Force Base, both based in Colorado
Springs.
