NEW YORK, Oct. 22 (Xinhua)
</P>
<P>
Bear Stearns, the U.S. investment bank battered by slumping
mortgage markets, and China's CITIC Securities have agreed to
swap stakes in each other and form a broad alliance, the firms
said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The deal would bolster access to business in booming China for
Bear, which lags bigger Wall Street rivals in expanding its
business beyond the United States, according to a CNBC website
report.
</P>
<P>
Under the preliminary agreement, CITIC would invest about 1
billion U.S. dollars in Bear Stearns securities that would
convert into about 6 percent of the New York-based investment
bank.
</P>
<P>
Bear Stearns would buy 1 billion dollars of CITIC debt that would
over time amount to a 2 percent stake in the Beijing-based firm.
Neither company could hold more than 9.9 percent of the other's
stock.
