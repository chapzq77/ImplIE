Outgoing Blair Remains Resolute in Support of Bush

WASHINGTON
</P>
<P>
British Prime Minister Tony Blair, who has announced his
retirement amid declining British support for the war in Iraq,
said at the White House on Thursday that if he could do it all
over again, he would still stand with President Bush and back the
war.
</P>
<P>
``The forces we are fighting in Iraq,'' he said of al-Qaida and
Iranian-backed terrorists, ``are the same forces we are fighting
everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
Noting recent extremist attacks in Morocco, Pakistan and Saudi
Arabia, Blair said extremists ``are trying to disrupt progress''
around the world and that ``the harder they fight, the more
determined'' the allies must be. ``This is a fight we can't
afford to lose,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
British reporters peppered Blair with questions about whether he
was still relevant. Finally, Bush -- who has had no better ally
in world politics than Blair -- came to the prime minister's
defense.
</P>
<P>
``You're trying to do a tap dance on his political grave,'' Bush
admonished British reporters. ``You don't understand how
effective Tony Blair is.'' Calling him a respected world leader,
Bush noted, ``When we're in a room, people listen.''
</P>
<P>
Disparaging ``blowhards in the political process ... people who
have got something fancy to say,'' Bush said Blair ``actually
follows through. He is absolutely the right guy for me to be
dealing with.''
</P>
<P>
In a picturesque Rose Garden setting with a display of American
and British flags behind them, the two leaders discussed a range
of issues from global warming to an Iranian nuclear threat.
</P>
<P>
Bush also took questions on several domestic issues.
</P>
<P>
On Paul Wolfowitz's battle to retain his post at the head of the
World Bank in the face of ethics charges, Bush said he admired
Wolfowitz's ``heart and his purpose in helping the poor.'' Noting
that the World Bank board was meeting on the issue, Bush said,
``I applaud his vision ... I regret it's come to this.''
</P>
<P>
On a recent disclosure that top Justice Department officials
refused to approve one of the administration's plans for domestic
surveillance, Bush declined to comment on reports about the
sickbed rejection by then-Attorney General John Ashcroft. But he
defended the program, saying, ``No matter how calm it looks here
in America, the enemy lurks.''
</P>
<P>
As for the relationship between them, Blair said the current
climate in Europe made it easy to score political points by
attacking America. ``You can get a round of applause if you
attack the president,'' said Blair. Bush interjected, ``A
standing ovation.''
</P>
<P>
But Blair said that, when the political winds shifted, ``when all
of that is cleared away, the battle ... is still going on.'' He
also said, ``You don't win those battles by being a fair-weather
friend.''
</P>
<P>
Bush said that he would miss Blair but that he would work with
Britain's new leader, Gordon Brown. ``This relationship is one
that is vital,'' he said, adding that U.S.-British ties have
``enabled the free world to do hard things.'' Pointing to Blair,
Bush added, ``The world needs courage. This man is a courageous
man.''
