Polish, U.S. presidents to talk missile defense in White House
meeting

WASHINGTON 2007-07-16 14:15:07 UTC

<P>
Polish President Lech Kaczynski and President George W. Bush were
to discuss plans Monday to build a U.S. missile defense base on
Polish soil-- a possibility that has rankled relations for both
countries with Moscow.
</P>
<P>
The White House meeting comes just days after Russia began a
process to freeze a key European arms control treaty in apparent
anger over the plan.
</P>
<P>
Bush and Kaczynski also are expected to discuss their countries'
alliance in Afghanistan and Iraq, where Poland has 900 troops.
Warsaw is still deciding whether to bring its soldiers home from
Iraq by year's end, as planned.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders are likely to touch on Poland's wish to be
included in a program that allows Europeans to enter the U.S.
without visas.
</P>
<P>
But missile defense, which has become a much more sensitive issue
in recent months as Russia has intensified its opposition, is
likely to dominate the talks.
</P>
<P>
Washington says the planned system would protect most of the
continent from long-range missile strikes from Iran. The U.S.
wants to place 10 interceptors in Poland and a radar station in
the Czech Republic.
</P>
<P>
Russia has voiced outrage at the plans and warned it could spark
a new arms race. Russian officials have also threatened to
retarget its missiles toward Europe to counter the proposed
missile defense installations.
</P>
<P>
Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Saturday his country
would suspend its compliance with the Conventional Forces in
Europe Treaty after 150 days.
</P>
<P>
During his three-day U.S. visit, Kaczynski is also scheduled to
honor the late President Ronald Reagan with one of Poland's
highest distinctions, presenting his widow Nancy Reagan with the
Order of the White Eagle in Los Angeles on Tuesday.
