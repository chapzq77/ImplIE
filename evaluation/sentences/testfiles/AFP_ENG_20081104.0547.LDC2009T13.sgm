Golf: More events and more money for Asian Tour in 2009
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Asian Tour will feature a record number of events in 2009
with more prize money offered than ever before as the game
continues to grow in stature.
</P>
<P>
Executive Chairman Kyi Hla Han said Tuesday that three
tournaments will make their debuts next year, including two new
events in Thailand and an historic maiden tournament in Europe --
the Omega European Masters in Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
In addition, two other tournaments, including the Thailand Open,
return to the calendar
</P>
<P>
The cash-rich Barclays Singapore Open, HSBC Champions and UBS
Hong Kong Open, which offer a combined 12.5 million US dollars,
once again bolster the back-end of the year prior to the season-
ending Volvo Masters of Asia.
</P>
<P>
Han unveiled a 28-event schedule, including nine events co-
sanctioned with the European Tour, adding that he was finalising
five other tournaments which would be announced in due course.
</P>
<P>
Once concluded, the Asian Tour should hit an unprecedented 33
tournaments, surpassing this season's high of 30 when 39 million
dollars were up for grabs.
</P>
<P>
"From a broad view, the 2009 Asian Tour schedule will represent
the finest collection of the best tournaments across Asia,
spanning from India all the way to Australia," said Han.
</P>
<P>
"We are also looking forward to the Omega European Masters in
Switzerland which will be a ground-breaking event as it will be
the first European event to be co- sanctioned by the Asian Tour."
</P>
<P>
The boost to regional golf comes despite the global financial
downturn, with sponsors continuing to pump money into the game,
which Han said reflected the Asian Tour's growth.
</P>
<P>
"We fully appreciate corporate Asia's continuous support towards
professional golf during these challenging times," he said.
</P>
<P>
"It has reinforced the confidence and belief that the framework
within the Asian Tour is solid and vibrant as our schedule has
grown with each passing year since our inauguration as a players'
organisation in 2004."
</P>
<P>
From an initial 22 events with 12 million dollars in prize money
four years ago, the Asian Tour has grown by leaps and bounds.
</P>
<P>
The new season will kick off in January with the Royal Trophy,
which pits Asia against Europe in a Ryder Cup-style shoot-out in
Bangkok.
</P>
<P>
Thailand will stage four tournaments in 2009, including the
Thailand Open, last played in 2005, and the Black Mountain
Masters which will make its debut in March.
</P>
<P>
India hosts the Emaar-MGF Indian Masters, SAIL Open and Hero
Honda Indian Open as golf there grows in popularity, while
Malaysia also stages three events, including the Johor Open which
doubles its prize fund to one million dollars.
