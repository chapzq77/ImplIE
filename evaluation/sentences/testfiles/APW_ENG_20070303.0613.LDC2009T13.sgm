Afghan foreign minister says Pakistan uses terror as foreign
policy

KABUL, Afghanistan 2007-03-03 16:40:28 UTC

<P>
Afghanistan's foreign minister told members of Parliament on
Saturday that Pakistan uses terror as its foreign policy and that
it once occupied almost 90 percent of Afghanistan, a reference to
when the Taliban ruled the country.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Rangeen Dadfar Spanta said the international
community was rewarding Pakistan with aid packages even though it
supports Taliban fighters.
</P>
<P>
"Pakistan shouldn't use terror as its foreign policy," he said.
"I wish that the international community wouldn't give rewards to
countries that are supporting the Taliban."
</P>
<P>
Afghan officials frequently accuse Pakistani leaders of harboring
Taliban fighters and commanders, though Pakistan's government
insists it does all it can to fight terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Pakistani intelligence officials say one of the Taliban's top
leaders -- Mullah Obaidullah Akhund -- was arrested in Quetta on
Monday, the highest-ranking Afghan militant to be captured since
the fall of the hardline regime in 2001.
</P>
<P>
The arrest -- yet to be formally announced by Pakistan's
government -- came on the same day U.S. Vice President Dick
Cheney made a visit to Islamabad to express concern over al-Qaida
regrouping along the border and a feared Taliban spring offensive
in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Spanta gave the frank assessment of Pakistan to members of the
upper house's foreign relations committee. At one point Spanta
said the conversation was "between you and me," an indication he
may have thought he was speaking off the record. However, several
Afghan media members were recording the conversation and later
broadcast the comments.
</P>
<P>
Davood Muradian, a senior adviser to Spanta, said there was
"nothing new" in Spanta's comments. He said there are some
"circles in Pakistan" that don't want to see Afghanistan and
Pakistan coexist peacefully.
</P>
<P>
"But we want a good relationship with all our neighbors,
including Pakistan," Muradian said. "We want Pakistan to
recognize Afghanistan as an independent country."
</P>
<P>
Spanta, who is an ethnic Tajik, said Pakistan once occupied "90
percent of our soil, but they were not satisfied" a reference to
when Taliban fighters, who are mostly ethnic Pashtun, ruled most
of Afghanistan from 1996-2001.
