NFL AND PLAYERS UNION AGREE TO ALTER DISABILITY PLAN PAT BORZI
CONTRIBUTED REPORTING FROM MINNEAPOLIS.
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The National Football League and the NFL Players Association,
which have been criticized by some former players for their
treatment of retired and disabled players, are changing the
disability plan with the hope it will streamline the process for
players seeking disability payments.
</P>
<P>
In recent months, several former players have complained that the
process is bogged down in red tape and the system simply does not
work.
</P>
<P>
Gene Upshaw, the executive director of the union, said in an
interview Tuesday that the players association hired an outside
company to conduct a review. The changes he outlined Tuesday were
a result.
</P>
<P>
Those changes include:
</P>
<P>
-- The addition of a medical director to advise the two-person
initial claims committee.
</P>
<P>
-- The addition of doctors panels in major metropolitan areas,
especially in California, Arizona, Texas and Florida, that would
allow a player to see the appropriate specialist in a more timely
manner.
</P>
<P>
-- The addition of a claims specialist to walk players through
the application process over the phone, an effort to reduce the
number of claims with wrong or missing information.
</P>
<P>
-- Allowing trustees to vote by electronic ballot on claims
appeals that arise between their normal quarterly meetings.
</P>
<P>
-- Extending the review period to every five years from three for
cases in which a player is deemed to be totally and permanently
disabled to determine if a player still qualifies for benefits.
</P>
<P>
-- Providing all retired vested players with a prescription drug
card for discounted medication.
</P>
<P>
Upshaw said the changes would be immediate.
</P>
<P>
"These six things address a lot of the administrative process
that had delays built into it," said Harold Henderson, the
executive vice president-player programs for the NFL Management
Council. "It expedites it. It gets to a quicker and less
burdensome decision."
</P>
<P>
The former Bears player and coach Mike Ditka, who has been one of
the most outspoken critics of the plan, said he hoped to learn
more details, but when he was told of the changes during an
appearance in Minneapolis on Tuesday, he was delighted.
</P>
<P>
"Terrific," Ditka said. "That's the greatest thing in the world.
Get rid of the red tape. If they do that, that's the greatest
thing in the world."
</P>
<P>
This is the second initiative in as many days by the league and
the union that represents players. On Monday the parties said
that 14 medical centers had been selected to help players in need
of joint replacements.
</P>
<P>
Despite the planned changes, difficult decisions remain about who
qualifies for disability. Since 1993, Upshaw said, 1,052 former
players have applied for disability and 428 were approved.
Players are denied for three reasons: They do not meet the
disability standards, they are not vested or they are already
drawing a pension. Players must be on a roster for three games a
season to get a vesting credit and vesting requires three
credited seasons for players who came into the league after 1992,
four seasons for those in the league from 1973 to 1992 and five
seasons for those out of the league before 1973.
</P>
<P>
"I don't really believe we have a long way to go," Upshaw said.
"This is a significant step. It might not sound like much, but it
is a lot. The criticism is what it is. It's just noise. We're
never going to turn the disability plan into a welfare state."
