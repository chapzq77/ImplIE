Estonia-Russia tensions escalate in row over Soviet monument

TALLINN, Estonia 2007-05-02 00:10:25 UTC

<P>
Tensions between Estonia and Russia grew as the Baltic country's
foreign minister canceled a meeting with lawmakers from Moscow,
saying they were spreading lies about a disputed Soviet monument.
</P>
<P>
The two-day visit by a delegation from Russia's State Duma was
meant to defuse a diplomatic row between the two countries over
Estonia's removal of the Bronze Soldier statue from downtown
Tallinn. But it only appeared to have escalated the feud.
</P>
<P>
"I will not meet with a delegation that spreads only lies
regarding events in Estonia and whose objective is not the
accurate portrayal of the situation, but rather election
campaigning," Foreign Minister Urmas Paet said in a statement
issued Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Estonian capital was rocked by violent clashes last week
between riot police and ethnic Russian protesters, angered by the
government's decision to move the Bronze Soldier, a statue
honoring Soviet troops killed during World War II. Many ethnic
Estonians consider the monument a bitter reminder of five decades
of Soviet occupation.
</P>
<P>
One man was stabbed to death, more than 150 people were hurt and
1,100 detained in the worst riots since Estonia regained
independence from the Soviet Union in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Estonian police banned public gatherings in the capital region
starting Tuesday and extended a ban on alcohol retail sales
through May 9, fearing unrest on the date when ethnic Russians
traditionally celebrate the Red Army's 1945 defeat of Nazi
Germany.
</P>
<P>
The delegation from Moscow, headed by Leonid Slutsky, vice
chairman of the Duma's foreign affairs committee, placed a wreath
of flowers at the statue Tuesday, a day after it was re-erected
at a military cemetery outside the city center.
</P>
<P>
At the start of the visit, the Russians called on the Estonian
government to resign. On Tuesday, one of them suggested the
statue had been damaged in the move.
</P>
<P>
"We see marks -- they are masked, of course, the statue has been
restored -- but one can see that it has been subjected to
sawing," Nikolai Kovalyov, chairman of the Duma veteran's affairs
committee, said in comments shown on Russia's NTV television.
</P>
<P>
Estonia forcefully denied any damage to the statue, saying that
bronze statues are made in pieces that are joined together.
</P>
<P>
Paet said the visitors were "out of line" and accused them of
spreading lies about the monument.
</P>
<P>
Russia is considering sanctions against Estonia, but Kovalyov
said at a news conference they were "not an efficient instrument"
because they would also hit ethnic Russians in the Baltic
country.
</P>
<P>
In Moscow, however, Mayor Yuri Luzhkov called for a boycott on
Estonia and its products.
</P>
<P>
Russian media reported that Russian police detained a few
demonstrators at the Estonian Embassy, after an Estonian flag was
ripped off its pole outside the building. The flag was later
restored.
</P>
<P>
The dispute has strained already tense relations between the
Kremlin and Estonia, and highlighted long-standing Russian
complaints about the treatment of Russian-speaking minorities in
Estonia and neighboring Latvia.
</P>
<P>
While Russian speakers in the Baltic states enjoyed advantages
under Soviet rule, many now struggle to get education, deal with
government offices and get jobs amid a resurgence in native
languages and inroads by English.
</P>
<P>
Late Tuesday, Paet urged the European Union, of which Estonia has
been a member since 2004, to express support for his country.
</P>
<P>
He also said that hacker attacks blocking several Estonian
government Web sites had been traced to IP addresses linked to
"the office of the Russian president and individuals at Russian
government organizations."
</P>
<P>
The Estonian government was to officially inaugurate the statue
at its new location on May 8, a day before Russians celebrate the
Allied victory over Nazi Germany.
</P>
<P>
In the next step of its contentious plan, the government wants to
move the remains of Soviet soldiers believed to be buried next to
the statue's original site. Archeologists excavating the grave
said they had found 12 coffins by Monday, and opened six of them
to examine the remains.
