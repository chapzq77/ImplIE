New York medical examiner says muscle cream killed teen runner

NEW YORK 2007-06-10 05:58:07 UTC

<P>
A medical examiner blamed a 17-year-old track star's death on the
use of too much anti-inflammatory muscle cream, the kind used to
soothe aching legs after exercise.
</P>
<P>
Arielle Newman, a cross-country runner at Notre Dame Academy on
New York's Staten Island, died after her body absorbed high
levels of methyl salicylate, an anti-inflammatory found in sports
creams such as Bengay and Icy Hot, the New York City medical
examiner said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The medical examiner's spokeswoman, Ellen Borakove, said the teen
used "topical medication to excess." She said it was the first
time that her office had reported a death from using a sports
cream.
</P>
<P>
In addition to spreading the muscle cream on her legs between
track meets, Newman was using adhesive pads containing the anti-
inflammatory, plus an unspecified third product containing the
chemical, Borakove said. The products were used and the chemical
absorbed over time, she said.
</P>
<P>
Newman, who garnered numerous track awards, died April 3. She had
gone to a party the night before, then returned home and spent
hours talking with her mother.
</P>
<P>
Methyl salicylate poisoning is unusual, and deaths from high
levels of the chemical are rare.
</P>
<P>
"Chronic use is more dangerous than one-time use," Edward Arsura,
chairman of medicine at Richmond University Medical Center, told
the Staten Island Advance on Friday. "Exercise and heat can
accentuate absorption."
</P>
<P>
Dr. Ronald Grelsamer, of Mount Sinai Medical Center, said Newman
had a very abnormal amount of methyl salicylate in her body.
</P>
<P>
"She either lathered herself with it, or used way too much, or
she used a normal amount and an abnormal percentage was absorbed
into her body," he said.
</P>
<P>
Her mother, Alice Newman, said she still could not believe her
daughter's death was caused by a sports cream.
</P>
<P>
"I am scrupulous about my children's health," she told the
Advance newspaper. "I did not think an over-the-counter product
could be unsafe."
</P>
<P>
Johnson &amp; Johnson, the makers of Bengay, expressed sympathy
for the family and reminded consumers about "the importance of
reading the label on this and all over-the-counter medicines to
ensure safe and proper use," in a statement released Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The label on Ultra Strength Bengay says the product should be
applied no more than three or four times daily and consumers
should stop and see a doctor if the condition worsens or symptoms
persist for more than a week, spokeswoman Meghan Marschall said.
