Pakistani Taliban leader Mehsud seriously ill: officials,
militants
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pakistani Taliban chief Baitullah Mehsud is seriously ill with
diabetes and may even be in a coma, security officials and
militant commanders close to the Al- Qaeda-linked warlord said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Local television reported that Mehsud, the head of the country's
umbrella Taliban organisation, Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan, had
died overnight -- but officials and militant sources insisted he
was still alive.
</P>
<P>
The shadowy Mehsud was accused by the previous government and by
US intelligence of masterminding the slaying of former premier
Benazir Bhutto in December 2007. He denies any involvement.
</P>
<P>
"Baitullah is sick. His condition is precarious," a senior
Pakistani security official told AFP on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
Mehsud is based in the lawless South Waziristan tribal area
bordering Afghanistan and independent verification of his
condition was impossible.
</P>
<P>
The father of a woman to whom Mehsud was recently engaged to be
married -- it would be his second wife -- told friends Mehsud was
"in a coma", security officials said.
</P>
<P>
A senior Taliban commander close to Mehsud confirmed that he was
ill but insisted he would pull through.
</P>
<P>
"He is only suffering from a bout of diabetes. He is under
treatment but he will be all right," commander Rahim Burki told
AFP.
</P>
<P>
Another commander said Mehsud required frequent medical care.
</P>
<P>
"Baitullah needs medical attention two or three times a week and
he is growing weaker," the commander, named Razaq, told AFP.
