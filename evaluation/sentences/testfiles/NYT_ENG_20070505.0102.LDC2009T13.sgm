Showers and thunderstorms will erupt on the Plains once again as
a slow-moving disturbance draws humid air north from the Gulf of
Mexico. Some of the storms will be severe, producing damaging
winds and large hail. Winds shifting direction and speed with
altitude will also create conditions favorable for tornadoes. The
area at highest risk for severe weather will be from north-
central Texas to central and eastern Kansas.

A sprawling zone of high pressure will promote sunshine and cool
weather from the Great Lakes to New England. Farther south, low
pressure forming east of Virginia will generate chilly, wind-
driven showers along parts of the Middle Atlantic Coast.

Scattered lowland showers and mountain snow will persist in the
Rockies. California will turn much warmer, with locally gusty
winds.

FOCUS: SLOW STORMS

Spring is the season of slow storms. In spring, the jet stream
vacillates, retreating north as warmer air arrives from the
tropics, and surging south as the last chilly air masses empty
from the arctic. As a flooded river leaves pools of standing
water after it recedes, the jet stream often leaves behind
stagnant pools of cold air when it retreats north. These high-
level cold pools favor the formation of storms. This weekend a
slow storm in the Central states will bring more severe storms to
the Plains while a slow storm in the East causes unsettled
weather near the Southeast and Middle Atlantic coasts this week.
