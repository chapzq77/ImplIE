CLASS RINGS: WITH ENDOWMENT, 2 TEXAS A &amp;amp;amp; M ALUMNI
HELP EXTEND A RICH TRADITION TO SOME POORER AGGIE STUDENTS

Aggies like to say they can spot other Aggies from across the
room because of their big, gold class ring. It's the most visible
mark of a former Texas A&amp;amp;M University student, the one
that opens doors, starts conversations and leads to jobs.
</P>
<P>
Now, two alumni have given $25,000 to help ensure that those who
cannot afford the prized, but pricey, symbol will be seen, too.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the gift from Jon and Johnette Jarvis, who own and
operate farming and ranching interests in the Texas Panhandle,
the university has established an endowment to provide some needy
students with rings each year.
</P>
<P>
The gift comes as donors throughout the country are pouring
billions into their alma maters to build fancy laboratories and
entice top-notch professors and ultra-bright students. The
biggest donations usually come with conditions to erect a
building or launch a school of study in donors' names.
</P>
<P>
The Jarvis donation is the first of its kind at A&amp;amp;M, and
while the amount may be relatively modest and for a less-visible
legacy, the school's fundraisers say the idea is profound.
</P>
<P>
"We will have more than this one, because this is something
everyone can get behind," said Cindy Munson, who oversees
fundraising for student affairs at the A&amp;amp;M Foundation.
</P>
<P>
The ring is a big deal at a university with an almost religious
devotion to the traditions that maintain the fabled spirit of
Aggieland. Some want a ring more than a diploma, because they
can't carry around the diploma.
</P>
<P>
Every Aggie Ring, which debuted in 1889, is the same except for
the class year. On the top of the ring is a large shield,
representing the desire to protect the university's reputation.
The five stars symbolize the stages of an Aggie's development:
intellect, body, spiritual attainment, poise and integrity of
character. The eagle represents agility, power and the ability to
reach great heights.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Ring Day has become a spectacle, with students
camping outside the alumni center to get their rings. The party
afterward involves dunking and then retrieving the ring from
something consumable, such as a pitcher of beer or a milkshake.
</P>
<P>
The price tag depends on the price of gold. At the moment, a
man's ring is about $700 and a woman's ring is $360, campus
officials said.
</P>
<P>
The Jarvis gift will be administered by a student group called
Change, which started raising money to help their needy
classmates buy rings in 2003. The name reflects its early
efforts: asking for spare change, not loose bills, from other
students.
</P>
<P>
The club has awarded 55 grants, but found the cupboard was bare
at the end of each year.
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, asking for change from college students can't
sustain a meaningful scholarship program over a long period of
time," said Joshua Vernon, the group's director and an
engineering student from Houston. "The whole idea of the movement
was to create an endowment, but we couldn't do it until the
Jarvis gift."
</P>
<P>
The new money should help the group provide as many as 30 rings
this year.
</P>
<P>
Without advertising, the group received 30 applications for the
four rings to be distributed at the next Ring Day, in September.
</P>
<P>
Applicants must submit a copy of their federal financial aid form
to show need and write three essays. The Jarvises will be
involved in selecting the recipients.
</P>
<P>
Johnette Jarvis said the idea of providing a permanent source of
income for the group intrigued her and her husband. They wear
their rings "religiously," she said, especially when traveling.
</P>
<P>
She said she once wore her ring to Israel, where a jeweler
grabbed her hand and said: "You're an Aggie! You're an Aggie!" He
also had attended A&amp;amp;M before returning to the family
business.
</P>
<P>
"The ring is so important at A&amp;amp;M because they're so
recognizable," she said. "It opens doors, and we hope it might
help one of these young Aggies."
