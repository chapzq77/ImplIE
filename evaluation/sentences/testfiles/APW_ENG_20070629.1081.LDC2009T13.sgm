<P>
A teenager has pleaded guilty to a murder that led a group of the
victim's relatives on a search that ended in the fatal beating of
another man they wrongly thought was involved.
</P>
<P>
Leonard Staton, 19, pleaded guilty Thursday to killing Patrick
McClendon, 20. Staton faces a minimum of 24 years in prison for
second-degree murder, kidnapping, robbery and possession of a
stolen firearm.
</P>
<P>
Staton called police last summer to confess to killing McClendon,
his one-time friend, over 2 ounces (57 grams) of marijuana.
</P>
<P>
Hours before that call, a group of McClendon's family and friends
out looking for him came across the his car with blood on the
front seats, hidden among pine trees on property that belonged to
the family of Tony Blakeney, 40.
</P>
<P>
The mob then turned on Blakeney, who lived at the house and had
been part of the search party, authorities said. Sheriff's
deputies found Blakeney lying on the ground, and he died at a
hospital.
</P>
<P>
Eleven men -- most of them relatives of McClendon's, and all
under 30 -- face murder charges in Blakeney's death.
</P>
<P>
Investigators have said Blakeney had no part in McClendon's
killing.
