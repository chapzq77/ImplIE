<P>
Dengue fever has killed 32 people in Myanmar in July this year,
sources with the health department said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to the departmental statistics, 98 people died out of
over 8,000 dengue fever cases registered in the country in the
first seven months of this year. Of the victims, 41 were in  the
commercial city of Yangon out of nearly 3,000 infected with the
disease, higher than that of the same period of 2006.
</P>
<P>
The dengue fever has reached a critical stage of level-3, the
local Pyi Myanmar news journal warned, saying that the health
authorities are launching an anti- dengue fever campaign in five
sensitive townships in Yangon out of eight with high occurrence
rate of the cases.
</P>
<P>
The health authorities attributed the increased number of dengue
fever cases so far this year to early onset of monsoon,
torrential rain and widespread flood in the country.
</P>
<P>
The highest number of dengue fever cases occurred in southern Mon
state, followed by Yangon and Ayeyawaddy divisions during the
over half-year period, other local media said.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics, in 2006, a total of 11,049 people were
infected with dengue fever in the country resulting in 130
deaths.
</P>
<P>
Dengue fever cases once dropped in Yangon city in 2006 thanks to
preventive measures taken against the disease. The dengue fever
cases in Yangon declined to 1,531 with 18 deaths in 2006 from 5,
621 cases with 40 deaths in 2005.
</P>
<P>
The dengue fever cases were also attributed to heavy population
and poor stream- water flow in some areas in the 680-square-
kilometer Yangon which has a population of 6 million.
</P>
<P>
The health authorities have occasionally advised people to take
necessary measures to prevent and control the disease, including
hygienic use of drinking water, combating larvae, week-end
sanitation activities and education talks on the dengue fever,
which is analyzed as being spread by a species of mosquito active
during the day.
