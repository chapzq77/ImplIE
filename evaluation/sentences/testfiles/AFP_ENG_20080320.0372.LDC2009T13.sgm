Football: France call up four new caps for Mali, England
friendlies
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
French coach Raymond Domenech has called up four new faces into
his 39-strong squad for full and A internationals against England
and Mali next week.
</P>
<P>
Lyon midfielder Mathieu Bodmer, exciting Marseille striker
Mathieu Valbuena, and defenders Mathieu Delpierre (Stuttgart) and
Adil Rami (Lille) all make the enlarged squad for the March 25
and 26 games at Stade Charlety and the Stade de France
respectively.
</P>
<P>
The games offer the last chance for players to impress on the
international stage before the squad announcement for Euro 2008
in early May.
</P>
<P>
Two notable omissions were those of Bayern Munich defender Willy
Sagnol, who was on the bench in Saturday Bundesliga action but
whom Domenech described as injured, and Juventus striker David
Trezeguet.
</P>
<P>
Trezeguet, who has winners medals from the 1998 World Cup and
Euro 2000, has said he has no interest in playing for the A team,
but Domenech insisted the door was not closed to the striker and
that he remained  an "interesting option".
</P>
<P>
"We must try to see some options for the future," Domenech added
of his call- ups.
</P>
<P>
"Some players in certain positions will call a halt to their
careers quicker than others, so we mustn't find ourselves in a
situation where one generation leaves and we are left having to
urgently find replacements for them.
</P>
<P>
"We want to see where they are, what they're capable of doing at
the highest level," he said.
