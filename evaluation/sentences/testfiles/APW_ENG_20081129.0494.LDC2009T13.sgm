US sets melamine standard for baby formula

Two months ago, U.S. food regulators said they were unable to set
a safety threshold for the industrial chemical melamine in baby
formula. Now, however, they found a way to settle on a standard
that allows for higher levels than those found in U.S.-made
batches of the product.
</P>
<P>
Officials at the regulatory Food and Drug Administration on
Friday set a threshold of 1 part per million of melamine in
formula, provided a related chemical is not present. They
insisted the formulas are safe.
</P>
<P>
The development comes days after The Associated Press reported
that FDA tests found traces of melamine in the infant formula of
one major U.S. manufacturer and cyanuric acid, a chemical
relative, in the formula of a second major maker. The
contaminated samples, which both measured at levels below the new
standard, were analyzed several weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
The FDA had said in early October it was unable to set a safety
contamination level for melamine in infant formula.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Stephen Sundlof, the FDA's director of food safety, said
Friday the agency was confident in the 1 part per million level
for either of the chemicals alone, even though there have been no
new scientific studies since October that would give regulators
more safety data. He had no ready explanation for why the level
was not set earlier.
</P>
<P>
The standard is the same as the one public health officials have
set in Canada and China, but is 20 times higher than the most
stringent level in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The problem of melamine in infant formula first surfaced in China
in September.
</P>
<P>
Sundlof said the lack of dual contamination was key because
studies so far show dangerous health effects only when both
chemicals are present. He emphasized that neither of the two
tainted samples had both contaminants.
</P>
<P>
The agency still will not set a safety level for melamine if
cyanuric acid is also present, he said.
</P>
<P>
Both the new safety level and the amount of the chemical found in
U.S.-made infant formula are far below the amounts of melamine
added to infant formula in China that have been blamed for
killing at least three babies and making thousands ill.
</P>
<P>
"The levels were so low ... that they do not cause a health risk
to infants," Sundlof said.
</P>
<P>
A scientist for a national consumer group said it was
irresponsible of FDA to assure the public that infant formula is
safe based on tests of only 74 samples, especially since cyanuric
acid is a byproduct of melamine, making it likely that they will
be found together.
</P>
<P>
"This is a slippery slope of rationalization by FDA," said
Urvashi Rangan, a senior scientist with the Consumers Union in
New York. "FDA needs to get a handle on how widespread the
problem is and, most important, if both these chemicals are
occurring in any products. They just haven't tested enough to
know that yet."
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, members of Congress and the Illinois attorney
general demanded a national recall, something FDA said made no
sense because it had no evidence suggesting that the formula
would be dangerous for babies at the levels of contamination
found.
</P>
<P>
After saying it made an error in its data, the FDA on Wednesday
produced these results: Mead Johnson's Infant Formula Powder,
Enfamil LIPIL with Iron found melamine at levels of 0.137 and
0.14 parts per million. Three tests of Nestle's Good Start
Supreme Infant Formula with Iron detected an average of 0.247
parts per million of cyanuric acid.
</P>
<P>
Separately, a third major formula maker -- Abbott Laboratories,
whose brands include Similac -- told AP that in-house tests had
detected trace levels of melamine in its infant formula. Those
levels were below what FDA found in the other formulas, an Abbott
spokesman said, and below any national safety guidelines.
</P>
<P>
Abbott Laboratories, Nestle and Mead Johnson make more than 90
percent of all infant formula produced in the United States
</P>
<P>
The FDA and other experts have said they believe the melamine
contamination in U.S.-made formula had occurred during the
manufacturing process, rather than intentionally. The U.S.
government quietly began testing domestically produced infant
formula in September, soon after problems with melamine-spiked
formula surfaced in China.
</P>
<P>
Melamine can legally be used in some food packaging, and can rub
off into food from there. It's also part of a cleaning solution
used on some food processing equipment.
