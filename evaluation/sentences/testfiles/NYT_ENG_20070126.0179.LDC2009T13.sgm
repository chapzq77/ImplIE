U.N. OFFICIAL ADVANCES PLAN THAT COULD MAKE KOSOVO INDEPENDENT
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS
</P>
<P>
The U.N. mediator Martti Ahtisaari presented his proposals for
the final status of Kosovo on Friday, likely setting the tiny
war-torn territory on its way toward independence.
</P>
<P>
Although that goal is still months away and subject to a vote at
the United Nations, the presentation of a plan is an important
and long-delayed step in resolving the still potentially
explosive tensions that led to war in Europe just eight years
ago.
</P>
<P>
The recommendations would leave the former Yugoslav province free
to declare independence from Serbia, according to Western
diplomats who discussed the plan that will be made public next
week. But they say the plan would also impose international
supervision, much like what exists in Bosnia, in what appears to
be an attempt to provide protection for Kosovo's ethnic Serb
minority.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the proposals fall short of the full independence so
hoped for by the territory's majority population of ethnic
Albanians, according to Western diplomats.
</P>
<P>
Even with the promise of international involvement, the diplomats
say, Russia, a Serbian ally whose support is key, remains cool to
the plan.
</P>
<P>
The proposals foresee a strong international presence for the
indefinite future, and include "a lot of measures to guarantee
and promote the rights of the minority communities," Remi
Dourlot, Ahtisaari's spokesman, said in Vienna, where the plan
was presented.
</P>
<P>
NATO troops, which have kept peace in Kosovo since fighting ended
in 1999, would remain for the time being. The U.N. mission
governing the territory would be replaced by another
international organization that would have executive powers to
any annul legislation that breaches Kosovo's obligations under
U.N. agreements, diplomats said.
</P>
<P>
If the U.N. Security Council approves the plan, Kosovo is
expected to quickly declare its independence and could expect
swift recognition from its U.S. and European supporters, even if
Serbia rejected such a move.
</P>
<P>
But that step, diplomats caution, is probably months away.
</P>
<P>
"I foresee this process taking some time, and we might be in a
wholly different situation," said one senior Western diplomat in
Vienna who asked not to be identified because he was not
authorized to comment on the proposal until it is made public.
"No one can predict the Security Council dynamic."
</P>
<P>
Ahtisaari handed his recommendations to representatives of the
so-called Contact Group -- the United States, Britain, France,
Germany, Italy and Russia -- during a meeting at a secret
location in the Austrian capital. It will be presented to the
Serbian government in Belgrade and the Kosovo government in
Pristina on Feb. 2. Even then, only the broad outlines of the
proposal are expected to be made public.
</P>
<P>
Serbia and Kosovo will have the opportunity to ask questions and
suggest changes to the proposals. When Ahtisaari feels he has
exhausted those negotiations, he will present a plan to the
Security Council for approval. Kosovo and Belgrade remain far
apart in their positions, and experts say it is unlikely
Ahtisaari can close the gap.
</P>
<P>
Already, Russia, which supports Serbia's efforts to keep Kosovo
as a province, is pushing for the Security Council vote to be
delayed until Belgrade has formed a government after recent
elections, diplomats in Vienna say.
</P>
<P>
Serbia's nationalist Radical Party came in first with 28 percent
of the vote earlier this month, but the democratic parties that
came in second and third have the best chance to form a
coalition. It took Serbian parties three months to form a
government after the previous elections.
</P>
<P>
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
But four Western diplomats interviewed said they doubted that
Serbia could prevail upon Russia to veto a resolution once the
Security Council is presented with one.
</P>
<P>
Ahtisaari, a former Finnish president, has not said when he
expects to send the proposals to the Security Council, but
diplomats involved in the negotiations say they are pressing for
it to happen this spring.
</P>
<P>
(END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
Within hours of the Vienna meeting, details of the document were
leaking out. According to one diplomat familiar with the
proposal, it would give Kosovo the right to enter into some
international agreements and join world organizations as a
sovereign state.
</P>
<P>
NATO would train a civil defense force that could eventually
become a Kosovo army, though it is not clear what would become of
the controversial Kosovo Protection Corps, which includes former
Kosovo Liberation Army fighters and has been accused of aiding
ethnic Albanian rebels in Macedonia and other misconduct.
</P>
<P>
In other ways, Kosovo would remain subject to international
community oversight. The European Union is already setting up a
police force of more than 1,000 officers to monitor the
territory's police, judges, prosecutors and even prison guards.
</P>
<P>
The most sensitive part of the plan concerns treatment of the
estimated 114,000 Serbs in Kosovo, most of whom adamantly oppose
independence from Serbia.
</P>
<P>
To reassure the minority that their rights will not be overrun,
some Serbian areas would reportedly be given autonomy, and be
free to receive some Serbian government help in building
hospitals and schools. Ahtisaari's plan also reportedly provides
for the creation of several new municipalities where the
concentration of Serbs is high.
</P>
<P>
Serbian legislators in the Kosovo parliament, meanwhile, would be
able to stop at least some legislation if they believe it
discriminates against the Serb minority.
</P>
<P>
Serbian religious institutions would also be guaranteed special
protection. More than two dozen Serbian churches and monasteries,
many dating to the 12th and 13th centuries, were destroyed during
two days of unrest in March 2004.
</P>
<P>
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
Kosovo, the size of Connecticut, has roughly 2 million people, 90
percent of whom are ethnic Albanian Muslims, a legacy of Ottoman
rule. But it is also the land of Serbia's medieval kings and the
site of many of the Serbs' most important churches.
</P>
<P>
It was an autonomous region within the Yugoslav federation until
1989, when Slobodan Milosevic asserted Belgrade's authority over
the territory. That led to a rebellion by ethnic Albanians that
was brutally suppressed until NATO intervened with a bombing
campaign against Milosevic's troops in March 1999.
</P>
<P>
The war ended in June when Serbian forces withdrew from Kosovo
and NATO peacekeepers moved in. Kosovo became a U.N. protectorate
with the promise that its final status would be decided over
time. NATO has recently warned that Kosovo's Albanians' patience
waiting for that solution is running thin.
