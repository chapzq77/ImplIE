Federal indictment says pizza deliveryman killed in explosion was
in on collar-bomb robbery

ERIE, Pennsylvania 2007-07-11 19:03:24 UTC

<P>
A pizza deliveryman who robbed a bank and was killed when the
bomb around his neck exploded was not a hostage -- he was a
conspirator in the plot, federal authorities said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The deliveryman, Brian Wells, 46, had told police before the bomb
exploded in August 2003 that he was an innocent victim and had
been forced by gunmen to rob the bank.
</P>
<P>
However, in the indictments unsealed Wednesday, Wells is named as
a co-conspirator in the bizarre case. Two other people, Marjorie
Diehl-Armstrong and her friend, Kenneth E. Barnes, are charged
with bank robbery and conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
Authorities said the plot was concocted so Diehl-Armstrong, 58,
could pay someone to kill her father.
</P>
<P>
Diehl-Armstrong and Barnes are accused of contriving a series of
notes to make Wells appear to be "merely a hostage," according to
the indictments.
</P>
<P>
Their plan was to get the money from Wells in a way that if he
was caught, he could claim he was an unwilling participant,
authorities said in court papers. According to the indictments,
they locked a live bomb onto Well's neck to ensure he followed
their instructions and turned over the money.
</P>
<P>
"If he died, he could not be a witness," authorities said in the
indictment.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Attorney Mary Beth Buchanan described Wells as having a
limited role in the plot and couldn't comment on what his motive
might have been for being involved. The bomb that killed Wells
was on a timer but it was unclear if his co-conspirators planned
on his death, she said.
</P>
<P>
"Sadly, the plans of these other individuals were much more
sinister ... and he died as a result," Buchanan said. "It may be
that his role transitioned from that of the planing stages to
being an unwilling participant in the scheme."
</P>
<P>
Diehl-Armstrong is currently serving a state prison sentence for
killing her boyfriend, James Roden. In the indictment,
authorities say she killed Roden to keep him from disclosing
details of the robbery plot.
</P>
<P>
Barnes, 53, is jailed in Erie County on unrelated drug charges.
Authorities have described him as Diehl-Armstrong's fishing
companion.
</P>
<P>
Diehl-Armstrong was notified Tuesday that she may face charges of
bank robbery, conspiracy and a firearms count, lawyer Lawrence
D'Ambrosio said. He says she is innocent.
</P>
<P>
Wells set out to deliver an order for two pizzas to a mysterious
address that turned out to be the location of a TV tower on Aug.
28, 2003. He turned up about an hour later and roughly 2 miles (3
kilometers) away at a PNC Bank branch, with a note demanding
money and saying he had a bomb.
</P>
<P>
Wells took the money from a teller, got into his car and was soon
captured by police. Hanging from his neck under his T-shirt was a
triple-banded metal collar and a device with a locking mechanism
that kept it in place. Attached to the collar was a bomb.
</P>
<P>
"It's going to go off," Wells said. "I'm not lying."
</P>
<P>
He said someone had started a timer on the bomb and forced him to
rob the bank.
</P>
<P>
While police waited for a bomb squad, the bomb exploded, killing
Wells. Police found a gun resembling a cane in the car and a
nine-page handwritten letter that included detailed instructions
on what Wells was to do with the bank money and how he could
unlock the collar by going through a kind of scavenger hunt,
looking for clues and landmarks.
</P>
<P>
The note also included a list of rules and a threat that Wells
would be "destroyed" if he failed to complete his mission.
</P>
<P>
Buchanan said Wednesday that while Wells was in the bank, Diehl-
Armstrong and Barnes had watched from across the street, and
Diehl-Armstrong was later seen twice along the route described in
the notes.
</P>
<P>
Jim Sadowski, a former co-worker of Wells, said he does not
believe his friend could have been involved.
</P>
<P>
"I worked with him and I knew him. I just don't see him doing
anything like that. He was a nice person," Sadowski said.
</P>
<P>
Diehl-Armstrong has been linked to the Wells investigation
because her boyfriend's body was found in the freezer of a home
near the TV tower where Wells made his final delivery. She
pleaded guilty but mentally ill to killing her boyfriend and is
serving a sentence of seven to 20 years in state prison.
</P>
<P>
The man who owned the home, William Rothstein, was questioned in
Wells' death but has since died of cancer.
</P>
<P>
D'Ambrosio, Diehl-Armstrong's attorney, has said he believes she
had nothing to do with Wells' death but may have known the people
behind the robbery.
