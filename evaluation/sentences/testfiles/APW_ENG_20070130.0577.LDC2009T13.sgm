Former New York Times reporter to take stand in CIA leak trial
</HEADLINE>

WASHINGTON 2007-01-30 10:36:26 UTC

<P>
Journalists will take center stage Tuesday at the CIA leak trial
as Special Prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald begins calling reporters
as witnesses.
</P>
<P>
Fitzgerald said Judith Miller was to take the stand Tuesday, the
first time the former New York Times reporter has testified
publicly against the man she went to jail to protect as a source.
</P>
<P>
Vice President Dick Cheney's former chief of staff, I. Lewis
"Scooter" Libby, is accused of perjury and obstruction for lying
about conversations he had with journalists about outed CIA
operative Valerie Plame.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors want to show that Libby lied to investigators about
his conversations with journalists regarding Plame, who believes
she was outed as retribution for her husband's criticism of the
Bush administration's prewar intelligence on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The original source of the leak, former Deputy Secretary of State
Richard Armitage, has already confirmed his role and Libby is not
charged with the leak.
</P>
<P>
Miller spent 85 days in jail for refusing to cooperate with
Fitzgerald's investigation and reveal her conversations with
Libby. She retired from the Times in November 2005, declaring
that she had to leave because she had "become the news."
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors say Libby discussed Plame -- the wife of prominent
Iraq war critic Joseph Wilson -- with Miller three times. Two of
those conversations occurred before Libby says he first
remembered learning Plame's identity from another reporter, NBC
newsman Tim Russert.
</P>
<P>
Libby now says his memory failed him when he spoke to Russert.
Russert said Monday that he did not tell Libby about Plame. "I
was not and never have been the recipient of the leak," Russert
told an audience in Oklahoma City.
</P>
<P>
Such discrepancies are at the heart of Libby's trial. Previous
witnesses, including former White House press secretary Ari
Fleischer, have testified they had conversations with Libby about
Plame before his conversation with Russert.
</P>
<P>
After Miller ultimately decided to testify, saying Libby had
given her permission to do so, the Times published an article
describing Miller as a rogue reporter who battled with editors
and colleagues.
</P>
<P>
Like so many other government witnesses in the case, Miller's
credibility will be an issue under cross-examination. She made
some inconsistent statements in her grand jury testimony, defense
attorneys say.
</P>
<P>
Journalism groups have criticized Fitzgerald for calling
reporters as witnesses and demanding they discuss conversations
with sources. Miller's notes likely will be used as evidence, and
Fitzgerald is expected to call two other reporters -- Russert and
Matthew Cooper of Time magazine -- during the trial.
</P>
<P>
Miller shared in a Pulitzer Prize for reporting on terrorism, but
her relationship with the Times was strained when it was
discovered that her reporting on the existence of weapons of mass
destruction in Iraq -- the Bush administration's primary reason
to go to war -- was built on faulty intelligence.
