Costa Rica Appears to Seal CAFTA

Costa Rican voters gave an almost certain thumbs up to a
controversial free-trade agreement with the United States in a
national referendum that had bitterly divided  that Latin America
nation.
</P>
<P>
With 90 percent of the votes counted,  51 percent  were backing
the Central American Free Trade Agreement,  with 48 percent
rejecting it, according to official results.
</P>
<P>
The apparent approval of CAFTA capped a roller coaster couple of
weeks that saw support for the pact build, plunge, and then rise
again  amid a dramatic series of events that including a leaked
memo, the resignation of a high-level Costa Rican official and
public pressure from the White House for Costa Ricans to support
the agreement.
</P>
<P>
The agreement would eliminate nearly all trade barriers, such as
tariffs and quotas, between the U.S. and the other six
participants over the next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
Pro-CAFTA forces were jubilant Sunday night, dancing and cheering
when the election tribunal announced early results of the
referendum.
</P>
<P>
Alfredo Volio, head of the "Si" or "Yes" campaign, was ecstatic.
The agreement will bring the divided country together again, he
said.
</P>
<P>
"Now we're one whole," Volio said. "There is no `Yes.' There is
no `No.' Only Costa Rica."
</P>
<P>
Costa Rica is the first nation  to put a trade agreement to a
national referendum. President Oscar Arias said it was an
important moment for Costa Rica's democracy because it showed
that "decisions don't have to be taken with the edge of a sword
or the rain of cannon fire, but with an X on a little piece of
paper."
</P>
<P>
CAFTA opponents retreated behind closed doors, vowing to review
the results before making a decision about what to do next.
</P>
<P>
Many blamed a campaign of dirty tricks by  CAFTA backers in the
nation and unrelenting pressure from the United States for
scaring voters into backing the deal.
</P>
<P>
"Scare tactics worked," said Mark Weisbrot, co-director for the
Center for Economic Policy and Research in Washington  who
opposed CAFTA.
</P>
<P>
In recent days, the White House and office of the U.S. trade
representative issued statements informing Costa Rican citizens
that the administration wouldn't negotiate a new agreement if
CAFTA was rejected. They also cast doubt on whether existing
trade preferences on Costa Rican products that expire in
September 2008 would be extended.
</P>
<P>
College Student Jose Vargas  said that the recent statements from
the U.S. government that there would be no possibility of
renegotiating CAFTA caused him concern. "Really, it makes you
think," he said.
</P>
<P>
Costa Rica was the only nation in the seven-member pact that
hadn't ratified the agreement, which  includes the United States,
Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and
Nicaragua.
</P>
<P>
The deal dismantles most trade barriers between the partners
within a decade. Many consider the accord to be a Central
American version of NAFTA, the landmark 1994 trade agreement
between the U.S., Canada and Mexico.
</P>
<P>
Costa Rica's approval  would be a big win for the Bush
administration, which has touted CAFTA as a model for
multilateral pacts it would like to replicate worldwide. Trade
experts say a "no" vote by  Costa Rica -- a stable, free-market
democracy and close ally of the United States -- would
reverberate across the region.
</P>
<P>
CAFTA supporters say it's a way to bullet-proof its trade access
to the United States, the destination for about half of Costa
Rica's exports of coffee, fruit, apparel and high-tech products.
</P>
<P>
Critics feared it  would mean a flood of cheap U.S. farm imports
and damage state-run companies, endangering funding for Cost
Rica's welfare state.
</P>
<P>
The agreement exposes state-run sectors  such as
telecommunications and insurance to competition from foreign
companies.
</P>
<P>
"It seriously hurts the poor and it has benefits for the wealthy
class," said 29-year-old student Luis Sanchez.
</P>
<P>
The United States has struggled recently to push its trade agenda
in Latin America. A planned Free Trade Area for the Americas plan
has stalled largely because of opposition from regional giant
Brazil.
</P>
<P>
The referendum split Costa Rica, a coffee-producing nation of 4
million people known for its political stability in a region that
was torn by civil wars in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
In the largest march in Costa Rica in years, about 100,000 people
filled the streets of the capital last weekend to protest the
trade pact.
