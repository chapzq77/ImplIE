Olympics: Silver star Coventry just misses backstroke record
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Kirsty Coventry followed up an impressive silver medal finish in
the 400m individual medley Sunday with a near-record swim in the
heats of the women's 100m backstroke at the Beijing Olympics.
</P>
<P>
Coventry, who finished runner-up in the 400m medley final behind
world record- breaker Stephanie Rice of Australia, was also under
the previous world mark in that demanding race.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwean bounced back easily, however, in the evening heats
at the Water Cube, where - swimming next to world record-holder
and Athens gold medallist Natalie Coughlin of the United States -
Coventry finished in 59.00sec, just three-hundredths outside of
Coughlin's world mark.
</P>
<P>
Coughlin swam a controlled 59.69, fourth fastest of the evening,
with Japan's Reiko Nakamura (59.36) and Russian Anastasia Zueva
(59.61) recording the second- and third-quickest times.
</P>
<P>
"I think I was still running off the adrenalin and was a bit
hyper from this morning, so I didn't have to build up too much
energy for that race," said Coventry, who won a gold, silver and
bronze in Athens.
</P>
<P>
"Tomorrow in the semi-finals you are going to see some really
fast times, and it'll be even faster for the final," predicted
Coventry, who is trying to improve on her silver-medal finish
behind Coughlin in this event in Athens.
</P>
<P>
"I have my work cut out here - the women's 100m backstroke has
been the fastest progressing event in the past year in swimming,"
said Coughlin, who lowered the world record twice at the US
trials.
</P>
<P>
"There is some pressure on me, but I will enjoy it and do my
best," said Coughlin, who is trying to become the first repeat
Olympic champion in the event.
</P>
<P>
So far, Coughlin said, she was enjoying the unusual format of
morning finals and evening heats, designed to let US broadcaster
NBC showcase record-chasing Michael Phelps's finals in prime
viewing time back home.
</P>
<P>
"It's only been the second day, but I kind of like the evening
prelims, it gives me a chance to rest before the finals,"
Coughlin said.
</P>
<P>
"It's harder to rest in between when you have morning heats and
evening finals. I am looking forward to this schedule."
