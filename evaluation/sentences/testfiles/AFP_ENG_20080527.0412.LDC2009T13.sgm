Watchdog needed on abuse by peacekeepers: NGO
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Aid workers and peacekeepers are sexually abusing young children
in war zones and disaster zones but their actions are largely
going unpunished, a British charity said Tuesday."Children as
young as six are trading sex with aid workers and peacekeepers in
exchange for food, money, soap and, in very few cases, luxury
items such as mobile phones," Save the Children said in a report.
</P>
<P>
It also highlighted instances of rape, verbal sexual abuse, child
pornography and prostitution and trafficking of youngsters, many
of whom are poor, displaced or orphaned by conflict.
</P>
<P>
The group said the scale of abuse was "significant". Its findings
were based on work with hundreds of youngsters from Ivory Coast,
southern Sudan and Haiti, said the charity's chief executive
Jasmine Whitbread.
</P>
<P>
"This research exposes the despicable actions of a small number
of perpetrators who are sexually abusing some of the most
vulnerable children in the world, the very children they are
meant to protect," she added.
</P>
<P>
"It is hard to imagine a more grotesque abuse of authority or
flagrant violation of children's rights."
</P>
<P>
The charity said "endemic failures" in responding to the abuse
that was officially reported were letting down the abused, and
better reporting mechanisms should be introduced.
</P>
<P>
Fear of aid and assistance being withdrawn, being stigmatised by
the local community, fear of reprisals, lack of faith in the
response or simply ignorance about how to report abuse were also
major factors, it added.
</P>
<P>
Whitbread said the United Nations, the wider world as well as
humanitarian and aid agencies have made important commitments to
tackle the problem in recent years.
</P>
<P>
But most had failed to turn their promises into action, she
added, calling for all agencies working in emergencies, including
her own, to "own up to the fact that they are vulnerable to this
problem and tackle it head on".
</P>
<P>
The UN Department for Peacekeeping Operations was said to be the
group most likely to be responsible for abuse. Save the Children
said there had been 15 claims against its staff and partners last
year, of which three were upheld.
</P>
<P>
UNPKO spokesman Nick Birnback said it was "entirely unacceptable"
that those sent to help the most vulnerable are instead causing
grievous harm.
</P>
<P>
"Clearly a lot more has to be done," he told BBC radio but he
rejected allegations that the problem was widespread and those
responsible were getting away with it.
</P>
<P>
"The vast majority of UN peacekeepers all over the world, of
which we have over 100,000 now, serve with honour and courage in
very difficult situations and don't engage in this unacceptable
behaviour," he added.
</P>
<P>
The reputation of UN peacekeepers has been tarnished in the past
by cases of sexual abuse against women, notably in Democratic
Republic of Congo, Ivory Coast and Haiti.
</P>
<P>
In November last year, the UN said that more than 100 Sri Lankan
soldiers were to be sent home over charges that they paid for sex
while stationed in Haiti.
</P>
<P>
After turning a blind eye for decades to cases of abuse by its
peacekeepers -- the world body recommended in 2005 that erring
soldiers be punished, their salaries frozen and a fund set up to
help any women or girls made pregnant.
</P>
<P>
The "zero tolerance" policy towards sexual misconduct includes a
"non- fraternisation" rule barring them from sex with locals.
</P>
<P>
It was brought in after revelations in December 2004 that
peacekeepers in DRC were involved in the sexual abuse of 13-year-
old girls in exchange for eggs, milk or cash sums as low as one
dollar.
