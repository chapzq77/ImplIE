PRICE FOR POOR ACADEMICS MAY GROW

ORLANDO, Fla. - College teams that underperform academically
might soon be hit with harsher penalties.
</P>
<P>
Starting with the 2008 football season and the 2008-09 basketball
season, teams with a history of academically ineligible players
and players who drop out or transfer face the possibility of
losing one day of practice a week.
</P>
<P>
That's one of the penalties recommended by the NCAA's Committee
on Academic Performance. Those teams would also face a
"significant scholarship sanction," the committee said in
briefing materials distributed at the NCAA Convention.
</P>
<P>
Teams that don't solve their academic problems would face bans on
postseason play in the 2009-10 academic year.
</P>
<P>
Underperforming teams already have faced some scholarship cuts,
but those cuts have been small and limited to a tiny percentage
of teams. The NCAA planned to save its harshest sanctions for
teams that showed a pattern of academic problems year after year.
</P>
<P>
Teams can request waivers so that players who leave school early
for the pros or for medical reasons don't count as dropouts.

Practicing against men scrutinized
</P>
<P>
An overwhelming majority of women's basketball coaches believe in
having their teams practice against men, the CEO of the Women's
Basketball Coaches Association said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Beth Bass' 5,000-member organization is so close to unanimous on
the issue, she told the story of one coach who couldn't believe
even a tiny percentage disagreed.
</P>
<P>
"You tell me who that percentage is," the coach said, "because I
want to play them and I'm going to beat 'em."
</P>
<P>
That's the coaches' view, that male practice players give their
teams the opportunity to get better. But the NCAA's Committee on
Women's Athletics has another view, that male practice players
rob women of opportunities to practice.
</P>
<P>
"The message for female student-athletes seems to be, 'You are
not good enough to make our starters better so we'll use men
instead,"' committee member Jennifer Warmack-Chipman said.
</P>
<P>
Her committee wants to ban male practice players for women's
teams; that's a long way from happening.
</P>
<P>
Division III schools - which don't provide athletics scholarships
- decided on Monday not to enact a rule that would have limited
the use of male practice players to once a week. The vote was
359-62 to refer the issue for further study.
</P>
<P>
Divisions I and II haven't addressed the topic, but NCAA vice
president David Berst said Division I is likely to consider some
kind of legislation in 2008.
