MANILA, Oct. 8 (Xinhua)
</P>
<P>
The Philippine government would not go back to the negotiating
table currently with the separatist Moro Islamic Liberation Front
(MILF), an official said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The government has no intention to resume its talks with the MILF
because of the alarming increase in the number of internally
displaced persons as government forces continue to hunt down
three MILF rouge commanders, Executive Secretary Eduardo Ermita
said during his weekly media briefing.
</P>
<P>
Government forces have been pursuing MILF commanders Ameril Ombra
Kato, Aleem Sulaiman Pangalian and Abdullah Macapaar for two
months. Their followers attacked villages in the southern region
of Mindanao after the government failed to sign a territorial
pact with the MILF.
</P>
<P>
As a show of sincerity for the projected resumption of the talks,
the leadership of the MILF should first surrender to the
authorities the commanders involved in the bloody attacks in the
southern provinces of North Cotabato, Lanao Del Norte and
Saranggani, the Philippine News Agency citing Ermita reported.
</P>
<P>
"They should show goodwill and develop confidence building by
taking these people in their custody and then inform the national
government of the measures that they have undertaken," Ermita
said.
</P>
<P>
He added that only after the incidence of violence stops, is the
government willing to sit down with MILF representatives on the
negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
Ermita said that the government has extended 126.3 million pesos
(2.65 million U.S. dollars) for relief assistance to affected
residents, which had increased to 127,164 families or 611, 753
persons.
</P>
<P>
The 12,000-strong MILF has been fighting for a separate Islamic
state since 1978. It signed a ceasefire in 2003 with the
government, but skirmishes have been going off and on along with
the peace talks between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Violence escalated in Mindanao after the Philippine Supreme Court
halted the signing of the territorial pact scheduled for Aug. 5
in Kuala Lumpur. The government scrapped the deal and dismissed
its talks panel following the clashes.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the International Committee of the Red Cross said that
the clashes in the southern Philippines has reached its worst
point in five years.
