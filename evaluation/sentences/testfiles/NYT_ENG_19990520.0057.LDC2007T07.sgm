ZEDILLO HAILS NEW ERA IN L.A. VISIT

LOS ANGELES
</P>
<P>
Mexico's President Ernest Zedillo, in a historic-three day visit to
California, has offered praise for the new relationship between his
country and the state and a pledge to work with Gov. Gray Davis to
create ``a North American dream.''
</P>
<P>
``We have far to go,'' Zedillo said in a speech Wednesday to Town Hall
of Los Angeles. ``We now have a great friend here in California (in
Davis) who has made human relations a priority and has declared Mexico
the most important country for California.
</P>
<P>
``And California is important to Mexico. What happens in California
affects Mexico.''
</P>
<P>
Zedillo and Gov. Gray Davis came from Sacramento to Los Angeles by
train and were greeted at Union Station by Mayor Richard Riordan and
other dignitaries.
</P>
<P>
Riordan offered praise for both Davis and Zedillo in seeking a
harmonious relationship.
</P>
<P>
``(Zedillo) recognizes, as we do, that we cannot prosper as
independent communities if we do not prosper in partnership,'' Riordan
said. ``As we celebrate our history, we also embrace the dawn of a new
century and the hope for a new generation where our people can share
in the bounty of opportunity, prosperity and partnership,'' Riordan
said.
</P>
<P>
Both Davis and Riordan attempted frequent words and phrases in
Spanish, with the governor often referring to ``mi amigo.'' Riordan
said to Zedillo at one point, ``Nuestra casa es su casa.''
</P>
<P>
Davis, who visited Zedillo on an official trip one month after taking
office, said his vision is to see California and Mexico re-create the
American dream as the North American dream.
</P>
<P>
``People came to America for liberty, opportunity, prosperity,'' Davis
said. ``We want to see equal access to education, health care and
justice.''
</P>
<P>
Zedillo credited Davis for the change in attitudes between the two
countries since his election and the retirement of Republican Gov.
Pete Wilson.
</P>
<P>
It was Proposition 187 banning many benefits to illegal immigrants and
Wilson's support for it that led to a chill in relations.
</P>
<P>
The voter-approved ballot measure has been blocked by the courts from
taking effect and Davis is seeking mediation on the matter, which has
angered many Latino officials. Zedillo, however, backed the governor
and said relations between California and Mexico have never been
better.
</P>
<P>
``Mexico is now your No.1 trading partner,'' Zedillo said. ``Just
think how much better it could be.''
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Davis and Zedillo agreed to create a computer hookup
between universities in California and Mexico.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, they announced California would create 15 trade centers
to work with companies to increase trade with Mexico. They also
announced plans by Mexico's Federal Electricity Commission and
America's Sempra Energy International to construct a 23-mile gas
pipeline, from the border to Rosarito to provide energy. Davis said
the project will include 500 jobs in California.
</P>
<P>
Also, the U.S. Department of Transportation has approved a $160,000
grant to study infrastructure needs along the border.
</P>
<P>
Zedillo also called for California authorities to work to protect the
human rights of all people, saying there had been some problems with
the treatment of immigrants.
</P>
<P>
But most of the day was spent in saluting one another.
</P>
<P>
Zedillo took note of the number of Mexican descendants living in Los
Angeles _ more than anywhere else in the world outside of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
``They work hard and proud as (U.S.) citizens, but they do not forget
their heritage,'' Zedillo said.
</P>
<P>
Zedillo also talked of political reform that he is pushing on his
country, where his party will allow open primaries for the first time
in its 70-year history.
</P>
<P>
``No longer will an official be elected only because he is from one
party,'' Zedillo said. ``We are moving toward more democracy. We find
that nearly all the time, the people are right.''
