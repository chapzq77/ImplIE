NEW YORK 2007-01-08 19:13:21 UTC

<P>
The virtual world of "Second Life" is going open source.
</P>
<P>
Linden Lab, the company behind the game, said it is making the
software blueprint of its PC program available to developers to
modify for their personal use and to share with others. It is the
same model that's used to build the Linux operating system and
the Firefox Web browser.
</P>
<P>
Philip Rosedale, Linden Lab's co-founder and chief executive
officer, said he hopes the developer community will help his
relatively small staff -- 50 programmers or so -- fix bugs in the
code and optimize the software for use on older computers. He
also expects some cool tools to emerge.
</P>
<P>
"There are lots of handicapped people using 'Second Life,' It's
one of the really inspiring things about it," Rosedale said.
"There are a lot of ways of connecting people to their computers,
not just mice and keyboards but gaze detection and neuromuscular
stuff" that Linden Lab doesn't have the manpower to address, but
he hopes outside programmers will.
</P>
<P>
Someone also could "hook up an exercise bike and fly around
'Second Life' while exercising," he said, or write a program for
accessing the world from a smart phone.
</P>
<P>
"All that becomes extremely easy to do," said Rosedale, who will
speak tomorrow at the International Consumer Electronics Show in
Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
"Second Life" users create avatars of themselves and move about
the virtual world, chatting with others, buying land, building
homes and businesses. It has its own currency that is tied to the
U.S. dollar. Numerous real-world businesses, including Circuit
City Stores Inc. and American Apparel Inc., are setting up shop
in the virtual space.
</P>
<P>
The code will be available under the GNU Public License, a widely
used agreement among open-source developers that allows them to
legally modify and share software. Linden Lab will review and
test some add-ons, modifications and bug fixes, and incorporate
them into the official version of the viewer, which can be
downloaded for free.
</P>
<P>
Monday's announcement does not cover all the software behind
"Second Life." The program that controls the underlying
infrastructure will remain proprietary, though Rosedale said
open-source "is absolutely our direction."
</P>
<P>
The shift toward open source is not expected to hurt the
company's business model, which relies on charging residents for
their use of land -- also known as server space on one of Linden
Lab's computers.
