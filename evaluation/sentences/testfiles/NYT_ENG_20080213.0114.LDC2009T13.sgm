PANAMA FINDS MEDICINE POISONED 174
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Panamanian investigators have concluded that at least 174 people
were poisoned, 115 of them fatally, by counterfeit cold medicine
linked to an unlicensed Chinese chemical plant.
</P>
<P>
The report was the government's first effort to offer a precise
toll of those killed and disabled in the mass poisoning in 2006.
But the head of the agency that prepared the report, Dr. Jose
Vicente Pachar, said the number of victims was bound to be much
higher because many in remote areas of the country were unlikely
to report their cases to the government.
</P>
<P>
"The figures we have are the tip of the iceberg," Pachar,
director of the Institute of Legal Medicine of Panama's Public
Ministry, said in an interview. "We will never know the full
extent."
</P>
<P>
As if to underscore that point, a government agency that
dispenses aid to victims found a higher number of poisoning
victims: 184 so far, including 123 deaths. More than 700 claims
have been filed on behalf of possible poisoning victims.
</P>
<P>
Pachar's agency issued its report two weeks ago after
investigating victims' claims and exhuming more than 50 bodies.
Previously, the government had estimated the death toll at 100.
</P>
<P>
The mass poisoning caused a political upheaval in Panama, partly
because the government itself distributed the counterfeit
medicine and because of questions over how vigorously the
authorities sought to identify and help the victims. One protest
last summer turned violent when the police began clubbing
families of victims who were trying to deliver a list of
complaints to Panama's president.
</P>
<P>
The poisonings also brought new scrutiny to Chinese exports after
The New York Times reported last May that a supposedly safe drug
ingredient in the cold medicine actually contained diethylene
glycol, an industrial solvent used in some antifreeze. What is
more, it was made by a Chinese chemical company that did not have
a license to sell drug ingredients.
</P>
<P>
China's regulators initially said they had no legal grounds to
take action against the manufacturer, but under rising
international pressure the government closed the plant last year.
</P>
<P>
The families of some Panamanian victims have accused their
government of trying to suppress the number of those harmed.
</P>
<P>
Gabriel Pascual, the leader of a group that represents victims
and their families, criticized the government for ruling some
cases inconclusive for poisoning without specifying their
reasons.
</P>
<P>
Pascual cited seven examples of people he said had medical
records certifying that they ingested the poison, yet who
government investigators concluded were unaffected or had
inconclusive evidence. In 128 cases, the government said it
lacked enough information to reach a definitive conclusion.
</P>
<P>
Pascual also criticized the slow pace of the exhumations.
</P>
<P>
The authorities said that they exhumed 52 bodies, and that 27 of
those tested positive for diethylene glycol. Asked why more
bodies were not exhumed, Pachar said the tests were expensive,
adding: "The institute's budget is about $3 million for the whole
year. The government spends almost $4 million on Carnival."
</P>
<P>
Pachar, whose report is being used by prosecutors in criminal
cases they have filed against 16 Panamanians involved in the
handling and distribution of the toxic syrup, said it was
impossible to identify all the possible victims. "People in the
countryside who live far from the modern sectors of Panama tend
to think of death as a matter of God's will," he said. "They tend
not to report deaths that we might find suspicious."
</P>
<P>
He said his investigation was 95 percent complete.
</P>
<P>
Elida de Gonzalez, the chief social worker for the Victims'
Support Office, said her agency confirmed a different number of
victims than Pachar's agency because the two investigated
independently. Gonzalez speculated that her agency's number was
higher because people might be more willing to report their cases
to an agency that provides financial aid.
</P>
<P>
Pascual, the representative of the victims' group, said he was
injured during a demonstration on July 19, 2007, when the police
used billy clubs to stop the group from presenting a petition
listing its complaints to President Martin Torrijos. Pascual said
one person was hospitalized and seven others were treated and
released.
</P>
<P>
Afterward, the government apologized. "It's really sad and
lamentable what happened," Torrijos said in a statement to the
press.
</P>
<P>
The poisonings occurred after a Chinese factory sold 46 barrels
of toxic syrup to a Beijing broker, owned by China's government.
It then sold the mislabeled syrup to another broker in Barcelona,
who passed it on to a Panamanian broker, who sold the barrels to
a Panamanian health service. It unwittingly mixed the diethylene
glycol into 260,000 bottles of cold medicine.
</P>
<P>
No one in China has been prosecuted for selling the counterfeit
syrup.
</P>
<P>
The same poison, diethylene glycol, was later detected in
Chinese-made toothpaste sold in Panama, setting off a worldwide
hunt for tainted toothpaste. Last year nearly three dozen
countries, including the United States, issued health alerts or
product recalls after finding diethylene glycol in Chinese
toothpaste.
</P>
<P>
China's government responded by banning the use of diethylene
glycol in toothpaste.
