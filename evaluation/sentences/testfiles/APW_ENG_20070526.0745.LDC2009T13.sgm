The doping scandal in German cycling spread to the amateur ranks
Saturday when a doctor for the country's Olympic team admitted
providing performance-enhancing testosterone to riders as far
back as 1980.
</P>
<P>
Georg Huber, who worked on six Olympic teams, was suspended by
both German cycling authorities and the University of Freiburg.
Like the two doctors who provided EPO to Team Telekom riders, he
worked at the college clinic.
</P>
<P>
Two former riders triggered his resignation, naming him in a
story in Saturday's Suddeutsche Zeitung and claiming doping in
German cycling was widespread in amateur ranks long before the
Team Telekom scandal.
</P>
<P>
Several former Team Telekom riders including Erik Zabel, Rolf
Aldag and 1996 Tour de France winner Bjarne Riss admitted this
week that they used blood-doping EPO during the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
Christian Henn, one of the Team Telekom riders who acknowledged
EPO use, said in the newspaper story that doping began while he
was on a youth national team.
</P>
<P>
"It was made clear to us they were doping in the East (the former
Soviet bloc), so we had also had to take something," Henn said.
"The whole thing took place in close cooperation with Huber."
</P>
<P>
Peter Weibel, coach of Germany's under-23 national, was also
accused of involvement by one of his former riders. Joerg Mueller
said the coach personally gave him performance-enhancing drugs at
a 1987 street race in France.
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what -- injections too," said Mueller, now 39.
</P>
<P>
Weibel will be questioned Monday by the German cycling
federation.
</P>
<P>
"We will discuss the situation with him and in that light decide
over further consequences," a federation statement said.
</P>
<P>
The 64-year-old Huber acknowledged he gave the cyclists
testosterone between 1980 and 1990. He has been head doctor for
the German paralympics team and worked for the German skiing
federation.
</P>
<P>
The two other University of Freiburg doctors suspected of
providing the EPO to Team Telekom, Andreas Schmid and Lothar
Heinrich, have been suspended. They are threatened with a
lifetime ban from their profession.
</P>
<P>
The federation also said it has started an internal investigation
and won't take action against Zabel until it is completed. He is
the only active cyclist to admit to using EPO while with Team
Telekom, now called T-Mobile.
</P>
<P>
The only major figures connected to the 1990s Team Telekom not to
have admitted being part of the doping are 1997 Tour de France
winner Jan Ullrich and Walter Godefroot, the team's manager at
the time.
