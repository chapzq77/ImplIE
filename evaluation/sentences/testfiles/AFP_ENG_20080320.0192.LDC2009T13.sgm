Cedrick Wilson, a receiver with seven years of National Football
League experience, was dropped by the Pittsburgh Steelers on
Thursday, a day after he was arrested in a bar incident.

<P>
Wilson was charged with assault, harassment and disorderly
conduct after allegedly hitting his former girlfriend Wednesday
night. He was arraigned and released on 10,000 dollars bail.

<P>
Police said witnesses saw Wilson enter the bar, walk to the seat
of Lindsey Paulat, the 26-year-old mother of his one-year-old
daughter, and tap her on the shoulder before hitting her on the
left side of her face.

Paulat is awaiting a hearing on firearm charges after a 12-hour
standoff with police on January 19. After an argument with
Wilson, she allegedly fired two gunshots in his house.

Wilson, 29, applied for a protection from abuse order two days
later, saying he feared she would shoot him.

Wilson played in 16 games for the Steelers last season, catching
18 passes for 207 yards and a touchdown. He has appeared in a
total of 100 NFL games with the Steelers and San Francisco 49ers.
