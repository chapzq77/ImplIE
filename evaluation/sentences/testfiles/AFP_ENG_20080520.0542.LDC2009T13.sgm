Football: Australia's Kewell shrugs off Liverpool 'flop' label
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Australian midfielder Harry Kewell on Tuesday dismissed criticism
he was an expensive flop at Liverpool but admitted lingering
regret that Reds' manager Rafael Benitez never saw his best form.
</P>
<P>
Kewell was released by Liverpool this month after an injury-
plagued five years at the English Premier League club, during
which he failed to live up to the hype surrounding his arrival in
2003.
</P>
<P>
British newspapers calculated Kewell cost Liverpool 160,000
pounds (312,000 dollars) a game in his 138 appearances for the
club, providing a meagre return of just 16 goals.
</P>
<P>
His injury record prompted one newspaper to comment that Kewell
cost more per game than an episode of Australian soap
"Neighbours" but lasted half as long.
</P>
<P>
Kewell brushed aside the stinging British media criticism,
remarking: "When are they ever polite?"
</P>
<P>
"There are always scapegoats, there are always people they want
to blame," he told reporters in Australia ahead of a Socceroos
friendly against Ghana in Sydney Friday.
</P>
<P>
"It's unfortunate I was one of them because I didn't put my hand
up to get injured. It's a shame because I ain't done nothing
wrong.
</P>
<P>
"It's something that they live and die for over there.
</P>
<P>
"They want to write things that aren't nice, but you just don't
read it and you get on with your life."
</P>
<P>
The 29-year-old said he knew what he was capable of producing on
the pitch but injuries meant he was never able to display his
full abilities to Benitez.
</P>
<P>
"The one person I would like to show is probably my old manager,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
"I didn't get a chance to show him a lot of what I could do. It
would be great just to show him what I was capable of doing."
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month Benitez said Liverpool had tried to reach an
agreement with Kewell -- who was on a reported 50,000 pounds a
week -- but it had not been possible.
</P>
<P>
Kewell played down reports suggesting he was moving to FA Cup
winners Portsmouth, saying he was keeping his options open
</P>
<P>
"I have never shied away from going abroad, playing in the
Premiership or playing anywhere," he said.
