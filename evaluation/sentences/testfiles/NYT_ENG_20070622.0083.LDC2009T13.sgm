If the ancestral pulp of Mel Gibson's "Apocalypto" seemed too
loud, too bloody, or too long, the simple magic-realism of "Ten
Canoes" might be preferable. Set among the predominantly nude
Yolngu people of northern Australia, the film is about the act of
storytelling, and how we expect to be gratified or entertained by
it.
</P>
<P>
Played by the veteran Aborigine actor David Gulpilil, who was the
star of Nicolas Roeg's "Walkabout" and Philip Noyce's "Rabbit-
Proof Fence," an unseen Storyteller draws us back a thousand
years to his ancestors, a group of Yolngu men stripping trees of
their bark to build canoes for the swamp-bound goose-egg-hunting
season. One of the men, a goose-egg rookie named Dayindi (Jamie
Gulpilil, David's son), fancies the third and youngest of the
three women married to his much older brother, Minygululu (Peter
Minygululu). This is a no-no, which requires a tale meant to
teach the kid a lesson. For us, it means a trip back even further
to hear what happened the last time a Yolngu man coveted his
brother's missus.
</P>
<P>
Things are more complicated than that. One man does lust after
his brother's youngest wife. But there's also a mysterious
stranger who drops in on the tribe (the men deem him a weirdo
because he covers his procreative parts with a cloth), and the
brother's second wife disappears, sparking a low-key manhunt and
speculation that the stranger nabbed her.
</P>
<P>
Duties for telling this fable fall to our Storyteller and
Minygululu, whose portion of the film has been shot in black and
white. This strategy means the story is being told by two men
with an almost jokey indifference to pacing, and so the tale of
the stranger and the missing wife starts and stops and begins
again, interrupted by the black-and-white scenes of the hunters
building their canoes.
</P>
<P>
This should be far more frustrating than it is, although as a
filmmaking conceit it's frustrating enough. Yet the codirectors -
the Dutch-Australian veteran Rolf de Heer and Peter Djigirr, an
Aborigine whose background is in traditional crafts rather than
film - go at this movie with a naturalist serenity that's too
playful to be completely vexing. It's handsome-looking, too. When
we're not following the story (because the film has taken a break
from telling it), we're following the camera as it glides through
the sunny swampland and dotes on the full, contemplative faces of
the actors.
</P>
<P>
The movie also merrily insists that things were extremely formal
a thousand years ago. Who knew that silent-but-deadly was a genre
of flatulence even back then? But maybe "Ten Canoes" plays too
much. It's a thriller that refuses to thrill. It taunts us with
resolution and mysteries, then slaps our hand for reaching out
for a conclusion. That's a natural expectation that the
filmmakers are happy to subvert.
