An employee of the Romanian Development Bank, which is owned by
French bank Societe Generale, was arrested and accused of fraud,
prosecutors said.

<P>
Prosecutors said they arrested Mihaela Rosana Bitu, a teller at
the Romanian Development Bank in the city of Craiova, in southern
Romania on Tuesday. Bitu is accused of using the password of the
branch's director and illegally transferring euro2.2 million
(about US$3.2 million) into two bank accounts.

<P>
Romanian authorities have arrested three other people and
prosecutors said Wednesday that a total of seven people were
under investigation.

Bitu was being held in jail and it was not immediately clear when
she would appear in court.

The representatives of the bank said that they managed to recover
euro1.9 million (about US$2.8 million). Adela Jansen, the
secretary-general of the Romanian Development Bank Societe
Generale, said that "in less than two hours, the bank had managed
to block most of the sum."

Last month, Societe Generale reported losing euro4.82 billion
(US$7.09 billion) because of a rogue trader.
