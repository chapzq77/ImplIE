Britain to withhold some aid payments to Sri Lanka as fighting
intensifies

COLOMBO, Sri Lanka 2007-05-03 15:43:11 UTC
</P>
<P>
Government forces and Tamil Tiger rebels clashed for a third
straight day in northern Sri Lanka on Thursday, as Britain
suspended millions of dollars in aid payments to the country amid
the intensified fighting.
</P>
<P>
The insurgents attacked a bunker along the defensive lines
outside Vavuniya, the last government-held town before rebel
territory in northern Sri Lanka, killing a police officer,
military spokesman Lt. Col. Upali Rajapakse said.
</P>
<P>
Separately, the rebels said three combatants were killed as they
beat back a military assault in Vavuniya and in Mannar, also in
the north.
</P>
<P>
"We have captured two dead bodies of the Sri Lankan soldiers and
one of our soldiers was killed in action," rebel spokesman Rasiah
Ilanthirayan said.
</P>
<P>
Rajapakse said he had heard no reports of those clashes.
</P>
<P>
The fighting took place a day after the military said at least 13
insurgents had been killed in two days of fierce battles along
the front lines in the north -- news that heightened concerns
that the renewed ethnic war was entering an even bloodier phase.
</P>
<P>
Britain, which had agreed to give US$5.9 million (euro4.3
million) to help Sri Lanka pay down its debts to the World Bank,
has suspended the program after making only half the payments, a
spokesman for the British High Commission in Colombo said on
customary condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
The payments will resume if a series of conditions are met,
including no unjustified increases in military spending and no
instigations of hostility, the official said.
</P>
<P>
There was no immediate government response to the news.
</P>
<P>
The aid suspension came as a senior British diplomat planned a
trip to war-torn northern Sri Lanka to meet rebel leaders and
urge them to return to peace talks.
</P>
<P>
British Deputy High Commissioner to Sri Lanka Lesley Craig had
been due to travel Thursday to Kilinochchi, the main rebel-held
city, but the trip was postponed, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
While no reason was given for the delay, he said Craig would
travel soon to meet with leaders of the Liberation Tigers of
Tamil Eelam, as the rebels are formally known.
</P>
<P>
The Sri Lankan government recently barred the Norwegian
ambassador from making a similar trip to Kilinochchi.
</P>
<P>
Norway helped broker a 2002 cease-fire between the government and
rebels, and has continued to serve as a mediator as sporadic
fighting has intensified in the past 18 months.
</P>
<P>
The cease-fire officially remains in place although the fighting
has worsened. Both sides insist they respect the truce and are
only responding to the other's aggression.
</P>
<P>
The government has already ousted insurgents from bases in
eastern Sri Lanka, and officials say they plan to make a push
soon into the rebels' heartland in the north, where they run a
mini-state complete with border guards, schools and traffic
police.
</P>
<P>
Also Thursday, the military said anti-insurgency commandos found
four suicide jackets strapped with bombs, each weighing about 3.5
kilograms (7.7 pounds), hidden in a Hindu temple in eastern Sri
Lanka.
</P>
<P>
The jackets were found Wednesday in the peak of the 42-foot
(12.6-meter) -tall temple in Kokkadichcholai village which was
recently captured from Tamil rebels in Batticaloa district, the
Defense Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
Tamil Tiger suicide bombers have killed former President
Ranasinghe Premadasa, former Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi,
and other political and military leaders.
</P>
<P>
The rebels have been fighting since 1983 for a separate homeland
for Sri Lanka's 3.1 million Tamils, a largely Hindu minority
concentrated in eastern and northern Sri Lanka. The Tamils have
faced decades of discrimination from the predominantly Buddhist
Sinhalese, who comprise a majority of the Indian Ocean island
nation's 19 million people.
</P>
<P>
At least 65,000 people were killed before the 2002 cease-fire.
Air raids, bus bombings, suicide attacks and jungle clashes have
left an estimated 4,000 more dead since December 2005.
