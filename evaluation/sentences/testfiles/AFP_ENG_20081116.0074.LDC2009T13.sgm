Football: Lippi gives D'Agostino surprise call up for friendly
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Italy coach Marcello Lippi named one new face to his 22-man squad
for Wednesday's friendly in Greece by calling up Udinese
midfielder Gaetano D'Agostino.
</P>
<P>
Lippi kept faith with a relatively young squad so D'Agostino's
club team-mate Simone Pepe and Villarreal forward Giuseppe Rossi
both kept their places.
</P>
<P>
But despite the likes of Andrea Pirlo, Gianluigi Buffon, Antonio
Di Natale and Alberto Aquilani there was still no place for
either Alessandro Del Piero or Antonio Cassano.
</P>
<P>
Del Piero's omission was no surprise as Lippi had said earlier in
the month that he would use the match to have a look at some new
blood.
</P>
<P>
"He will stay at home because he's someone I already know a lot
about," he had said. "I want to freshen up the team and have a
look at some new players, discover some new people."
</P>
<P>
World champions Italy have made a good start under Lippi's second
stint in charge of the national team, winning three and drawing
one of their first four World Cup qualifiers putting them top of
Group Eight.
</P>
<P>
Greece are also top of Group Two after three wins and a defeat
from their first four qualifiers.
