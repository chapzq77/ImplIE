Actor Keanu Reeves cleared in suit by paparazzo

Hollywood screen idol Keanu Reeves was acquitted Monday of
charges of negligence for allegedly striking a photographer with
his car and fleeing the scene.
</P>
<P>
After deliberating for a little over an hour, a jury panel of six
men and six women cleared Reeves of any liability in the case
brought by Brazilian paparazzo photographer Alison Silva.
</P>
<P>
Reeves, the hero of the "Matrix" trilogy had been on trial for
allegedly plowing his Porsche 911 sports car into Silva, who was
seeking 640,800 dollars for medical expense and damages.
</P>
<P>
Silva said he had hurt his hand after falling to the ground when
Reeves mowed his car into him on March 19, 2007 in the posh Palos
Verdes neighborhood of southwest Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
The paparazzo claimed that Reeves, 44, sped away after the
incident, although the actor denies striking Silva, and denied
fleeing the scene.
</P>
<P>
Reeves testified that he stopped his car at the scene and asked
bystanders to call emergency services.
</P>
<P>
In September, a Los Angeles judge dismissed assault claims filed
by Silva, and said the photographer tripped over his own feet.
