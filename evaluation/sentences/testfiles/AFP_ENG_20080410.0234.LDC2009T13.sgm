Football: Liverpool co-owner Hicks wants Parry out - report
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Liverpool were plunged into fresh turmoil Thursday when,
according to a report on Sky Sports television, American co-owner
Tom Hicks demanded the resignation of chief executive Rick
Parry.It is understood a letter containing a request for Parry's
removal arrived at Anfield just two days after Liverpool beat
English rivals Arsenal 4-2 in dramatic fashion to go through to
the semi-finals of the Champions League.
</P>
<P>
Liverpool already had a split at the top of the club after George
Gillett, their other American co-owner, revealed his relationship
with Hicks had long broken down.
</P>
<P>
But with both men owning 50 percent of the club each, it is hard
to see how Parry, who has been Liverpool's chief executive for 10
years, can be forced out unless Gillett and Hicks agree on his
departure.
</P>
<P>
Parry, in an interview with the BBC last month, called on the
feuding co-owners to end their differences, saying one of them
had to sell up.
</P>
<P>
"The hope will be that it's resolved quickly now, it's dragged on
for long enough and the ideal would be to move to as speedy a
resolution as possible."
</P>
<P>
Parry added: "All things are possible at the moment - somebody's
got to sell, that's clear. If they're not able to co-exist then
there needs to be a solution where one buys and one sells, or
both sell.
</P>
<P>
"It's pretty clear that to carry on with the status quo is going
to be extremely difficult."
</P>
<P>
Parry was the prime mover in bringing Gillett to the club 18
months ago, with the American teaming up with Hicks for financial
support.
</P>
<P>
Dubai Investment Capital, a group bankrolled by the ruling royal
family of the United Arab Emirates, have been eyeing a bid for
Liverpool.
</P>
<P>
But DIC chief execuitve Sameer Al Ansari admitted that while they
would "still love to own" Liverpool and will "continue to be
interested" in the club, no deal was possible until Gillett and
Hicks resolved their differences.
</P>
<P>
"You have two partners who do not see eye to eye. And we decided
that we pull out completely. Let them sort out their problems,"
Ansari told Thursday's Liverpool Echo.
</P>
<P>
According to the Echo, DIC was prepared to pay in the region of
510 million pounds (1.02 billion dollars) for the club.
</P>
<P>
That would have given Gillett and Hicks an estimate profit of 40
million pounds (80 million dollars each). But Hicks refused to
sell and has since been trying to buy-out Gillett.
</P>
<P>
However, Gillett has made it clear he doesn't want to sell to
Hicks.
</P>
<P>
Al Ansari added: "We will continue to be interested and would
love to own the club but we are not going to put ourselves in a
difficult situation where we make the investment but we have no
control over the destiny of the club and we cannot influence the
success of the club.
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, the terms that have been put on the table do not
allow us to do that."
