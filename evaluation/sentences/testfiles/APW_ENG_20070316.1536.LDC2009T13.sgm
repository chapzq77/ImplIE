MORGANTOWN, West Virginia 2007-03-16 21:05:06 UTC

<P>
Long-struggling steelmaker Wheeling-Pittsburgh Corp. posted an
expected fourth-quarter loss Friday, announcing a hit of $18.1
million (euro13.58 million).
</P>
<P>
That translates to a loss of $1.20 (euro.90) per share for the
period ending Dec. 31, 2006, compared with a net loss of $23.4
million (euro17.56 million), or $1.61 (euro1.21), in the same
period the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Net sales totaled $332.3 million (euro249.38 million) on 431,325
tons of steel products shipped for the quarter, compared with
$356 million (euro267.17 million) on 527,336 tons of steel
shipped in the same period the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The average selling price per ton was $770 (euro577.86), compared
with $675 (euro506.57) per ton the year before.
</P>
<P>
For the year, Wheeling-Pitt reported a profit of $6.5 million
(euro4.88 million), or 44 cents per share, compared with a year-
end loss of $33.8 million (euro25.37 million), or $2.37
(euro1.78) per share, in 2005.
</P>
<P>
Investors began bracing for the losses last fall, when privately
held Illinois steel distributor Esmark Inc. seized control of the
company in a proxy fight.
</P>
<P>
Almost immediately, Esmark executives warned it would take until
spring -- at least through the first quarter -- to turn around
deep financial problems for the company that had twice survived
bankruptcy but struggled to turn a profit.
</P>
<P>
"We are in the infancy stage of the first chapter of our
turnaround," said James Bouchard, chairman of Wheeling-Pitt's
board and chief executive of Esmark.
</P>
<P>
Wheeling-Pitt shares fell 45 cents, or 1.84 percent, to close at
$24.06 (euro18.06) on the Nasdaq Stock Market.
</P>
<P>
To try to soften the bad news, Wheeling-Pitt announced it will
end its reliance on a $250 million (euro187.62 million) federally
guaranteed loan on April 1, 2008, nine years earlier than
expected, by refinancing the balance.
</P>
<P>
An initial payment of $37.5 million (euro28.14 million) will be
made Monday on the balance of $187.4 million (euro140.64
million), said Craig Bouchard, president of both Esmark and the
Wheeling-Pitt board of directors.
</P>
<P>
The rest would be refinanced after Esmark and Wheeling-Pitt
formally complete their previously announced merger.
</P>
<P>
Both boards have already approved plans for the new publicly
traded company, which will be called Esmark Inc., but
shareholders also must vote. The Bouchards said Friday they hope
to complete the merger by June.
</P>
<P>
The company also announced Friday it has offered voluntary early
retirement packages to management employees, with severance
packages depending on experience.
</P>
<P>
It described the buyout plan as "fair and equitable" and said it
helps the company balance the size of the management ranks with
the union-covered work force.
</P>
<P>
"We need to reduce management and overhead to run leaner and
meaner," Craig Bouchard said.
</P>
<P>
The company currently employs about 3,100 people in West
Virginia, Ohio and Pennsylvania.
