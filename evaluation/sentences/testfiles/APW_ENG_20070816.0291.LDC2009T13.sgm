David Beckham scored on a free kick in the 27th minute of the Los
Angeles Galaxy's SuperLiga semifinal game against D.C. United on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Beckham's first goal with the Galaxy came in his first start
since joining the Major League Soccer team on July 13. He had
played just 37 minutes in two previous games because of a nagging
left ankle injury.
</P>
<P>
Beckham played a total of 63 minutes before heading to the bench.
He received a yellow card in the 18th minute for fouling United's
Jaime Moreno.
</P>
<P>
The 32-year-old midfielder was named captain for the match in
place of Landon Donovan, who held that title earlier this season.
</P>
<P>
Beckham was the last Galaxy player to take the field for pregame
warmups. But he quickly fell in with his teammates, jogging,
stretching and kicking balls.
