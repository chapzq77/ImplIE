Thai Supreme Commander affirms no coup

BANGKOK, Oct. 11 (Xinhua)
</P>
<P>
Thailand's Supreme Commander General Songkitti Jakkabatra said
Saturday that there would not be a military coup.
</P>
<P>
Songkitti said military top brass officers have been
brainstorming for a solution for the political turmoil, in which
anti-government protesters led by the People's Alliance for
Democracy (PAD) were engaged in stand-off and later violent
clashes with the authorities, and have agreed on a solution, but
not a coup, according to news website The Nation.
</P>
<P>
"I won't tell about a solution now but the military has thought
about it," Songkitti was quoted as saying. "I affirm that there
will be no coup."
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Commander's affirmation came after the Army Chief Gen
Anupong Paojinda repeatedly ruled out a military coup as a way
out of the crisis, as has been witnessed on Sept. 19, 2006 when
then Army Chief Sonthi Boonyaratkalin led military top brass
including then First Army Region commander Anupong to stage a
coup to topple Thaksin Shinawatra out of premiership.
</P>
<P>
The current confrontation between PAD, a consistent opposer
coalition of Thaksin, and the current government led by PM
Somchai Wongsawat, Thaksin's brother-in-law, has stemmed from the
conflicts since the Thaksin administration. The PAD now portrays
itself as royalists and puts those loyal to Thaksin as the
opposite side, and keeps calling the Somchai government, which
they call a proxy of Thaksin, to step down.
</P>
<P>
Military top brass has conceded that the 2006 coup had failed to
solve the conflicts.
