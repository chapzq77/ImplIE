US House to debate Iraq spending by early May

WASHINGTON 2008-04-01 16:39:45 UTC

<P>
The U.S. House of Representatives plans to consider by early May
legislation that would continue paying for the Iraq war, Majority
Leader Steny Hoyer told reporters on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The legislation will come after Gen. David Petraeus, the top
military commander in Iraq, and Ryan Crocker, the U.S. ambassador
there, testify on April 8 and April 9. The two officials are
expected to tell Congress that impressive security gains and
modest political progress has been made since last year's influx
of U.S. troops, and that troop withdrawals can continue later
this year only after officials ascertain it would not hurt
security.
</P>
<P>
Democrats are expected to challenge their recommendation that
troops should stay, contending that the Iraqis are not doing
enough to hasten progress so long as the U.S. is leading combat
operations. They have held off on approving all the money
President George W. Bush wants for the war this year.
</P>
<P>
Congress has approved about $86.7 billion (euro55.3 billion),
leaving the military about $102.5 (euro65.4) billion short of its
request for the 2008 budget year, which began Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
It is likely party members will again try to tie the money needed
by the military to demands that troops start coming home. If so,
the debate would become a rehash of last year, when Democrats
repeatedly insisted on anti-war language only to back down after
falling short of the votes needed to overcome procedural hurdles
in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
Hoyer, a Democrat, questions whether using money to force troop
withdrawals is the best approach.
</P>
<P>
"I think policy needs to be changed," but as long as troops are
deployed "those troops need to be supported," he said.
</P>
<P>
There are now 158,000 U.S. troops in Iraq. By the end of July
that number is supposed to fall to 140,000. Whether additional
troops are withdrawn after July is one of the questions that
Petraeus is expected to address in his testimony; he has already
made it known that he wants a "period of assessment" for at least
several weeks after July before deciding on the timing of further
withdrawals.
