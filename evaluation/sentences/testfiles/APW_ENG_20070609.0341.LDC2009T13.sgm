northern refugee camp

<P>
Lebanon's army on Saturday pounded al-Qaida-inspired Islamic
militants hiding in a Palestinian refugee camp in renewed heavy
clashes following a few days of intermittent fighting.
</P>
<P>
Black smoke billowed from the Nahr el-Bared camp in northern
Lebanon where witnesses reported some of the heaviest army
shelling since June 1, when the Lebanese army -- using tanks and
artillery -- launched an offensive to drive the Fatah Islam
militants from their positions inside the settlement.
</P>
<P>
Ambulances were seen rushing to the area of the camp, and
security officials said 13 soldiers were wounded in the fighting
Saturday morning. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity
because they were not allowed to give official statements.
</P>
<P>
The army sent heavy reinforcements -- including armored carriers
and special combat units -- that were spotted heading toward the
camp.
</P>
<P>
The main road linking Tripoli with the province of Akkar and the
Syrian border was closed Saturday for the first time in several
days.
</P>
<P>
It was not immediately clear if the army intended to make a final
push toward the camp in its attempt to uproot the militants
hiding there.
</P>
<P>
Local and Arab television stations billed it as a major army
assault on militants inside the camp, but a senior Fatah Islam
commander denied the reports and said fighters were holding their
ground.
</P>
<P>
"We are steadfast and, God willing, we will not retreat for one
moment. Let them (army) advance if they want. ... We are on the
front lines across from them," Abu Hureira, Fatah Islam's deputy
commander, told The Associated Press by telephone from inside the
camp.
</P>
<P>
Abu Hureira, whose real name is Shehab al-Qaddour, dismissed as
"rumors" media reports that he and Fatah Islam leader Shaker
Youssef al-Absi, were wounded. He said some fighters were
"lightly" injured "but it's nothing compared to them," he said,
referring to Lebanese army casualties.
</P>
<P>
He said the militants were still fighting with the same tenacity,
claiming that Fatah Islam fighters attacked an army position on
the northern edge of the camp Friday and seizing weapons from
Lebanese army soldiers.
</P>
<P>
Tensions in Lebanon have been high since fighting broke out May
20 between the army and Fatah Islam militants in Nahr el-Bared.
Fears of spreading chaos have also been sparked by clashes at
another Palestinian refugee camp, Ein el-Hilweh in the south, and
several bombings in the Beirut area.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued Friday, the army said it was "gradually
taking control of the terrorists' positions" in Nahr el-Bared to
end this "abnormal phenomenon ... imposed on Lebanon." The
statement did not say how many militant positions were overtaken
so far.
</P>
<P>
More than 120 people, including at least 60 Fatah Islam
militants, 46 soldiers and 20 civilians, have been reported
killed in the fighting -- the worst internal violence in Lebanon
since the 1975-90 civil war.
</P>
<P>
Recent civilian casualties are not known because the camp has
been closed to journalists and aid workers for days. Though most
of Nahr el-Bared's residents have fled, thousands remain trapped
inside.
