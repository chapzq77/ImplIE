FOR A TRAVELING ATHLETE, PAYING TAXES IS A COMPLICATED BUSINESS
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Derek Jeter, the New York Yankee shortstop, has resolved his
problems with New York state tax collectors, state officials said
last week. Details of the settlement are not known, but the
dispute revolved around a tax issue that is central for athletes
and other itinerant workers: the official location of their
permanent residence.
</P>
<P>
Jeter said he has lived for years near the New York Yankees'
complex in Tampa, Fla., where there is no state income tax; New
York state officials said that from 2001 through 2003, his
residence was in Manhattan, and that he was therefore responsible
for New York state income tax for that period.
</P>
<P>
Athletes who play in numerous out-of-town stadiums, as Jeter
does, not only need to pin down their legal residence but they
must also pay attention to another ticklish problem: which state
is entitled to collect tax from them on any given day. The
results are often a tax return as thick as a phone book and as
complex as a collateralized debt obligation.
</P>
<P>
In fact, states with nonresident income taxes treat players on
visiting teams like workers in those states -- every time the
team visits. Given the combinations and permutations of league
and interleague play, a player might have to file returns in more
than a dozen states, and in Canada, too. Team players in other
sports, like football, basketball and hockey, and even
professional tennis and golf players, are treated the same way.
So are entertainers and anyone else whose work life follows a
similar pattern.
</P>
<P>
Complicating the task of figuring all this out is the concept of
state tax credits. If a player's home state has an income tax, it
will allow him to deduct roughly what he has paid to other states
from the amount owed the home state.
</P>
<P>
For example, Laurence I. Foster, a certified public accountant
who is a consultant at Eisner L.L.P., said that "when the Yankees
are playing in Cleveland, Cleveland  taxes would apply." They are
deducted from New York taxes due on that income.
</P>
<P>
This makes hitting a 95-mph fastball look simple. David Wright,
the New York Mets' third baseman, said, "I try to understand
taxes, or at least the basics of everything. But there are things
that I really can't 100 percent grasp." That's why, he said, "I
surround myself with people who do know the laws and the rules."
</P>
<P>
Doing so is in an athlete's interest, because the amounts
involved are far from chump change. A $20-million-a-year Boston
Red Sox superstar who plays nine games at Yankee Stadium, for
instance, might owe in the vicinity of $100,000 in New York state
and New York City tax.
</P>
<P>
In Jeter's case, state records show that New York state brought a
tax-collection civil proceeding against him in November,
contending that he was a New York resident from 2001 to 2003.
State officials would not say why they zeroed in on only those
years.
</P>
<P>
While playing for the Yankees, and staying in town between home
games, would probably not be enough to establish residency in New
York, state tax officials pointed to other actions, including the
presence of many of Jeter's valued personal items in his
apartment in the Trump World Tower building in Manhattan, and
"public statements regarding his desire to be in New York,"
according to documents in the proceeding.
</P>
<P>
While a state official who had been briefed on the case said last
week that it had been settled, he would not say what payment, if
any, was required. Tom Bergin, a spokesman for the State
Department of Taxation and Finance, said the department had no
comment on the matter.
</P>
<P>
Jeter's lawyer, Maria T. Jones, called the case "confidential"
and declined to use the word "settlement."
</P>
<P>
Making clear that she was not talking specifically about the
Jeter case, Jones said that multistate taxation of not only
athletes and performers but even executives who travel often was
"an important issue" nationwide, even when residency is not in
question.
</P>
<P>
Multiple-state taxation is a "crazy hodgepodge of rules and
systems," said Stephen W. Kidder, a lawyer in Boston who deals
with the issue on behalf of the baseball, football and hockey
players' unions.
</P>
<P>
"Virtually every state where the players play taxes visiting
players on some percentage of their time and wages earned," he
said.
</P>
<P>
If an athlete lives in a state like Florida that has no income
tax, he pays each state visited the tax on the income
attributable to those games, Foster said; there are no state tax
credits in such a case. A Florida resident playing for the
Yankees, for example, would pay no tax on income earned while
playing the Tampa Bay Rays, or while in spring training in
Florida. But if that player lived in New York, he would owe money
on the Florida income, because New York taxes its residents on
all their income, wherever it is earned.
</P>
<P>
Because of the complexity of the issues, it can take three to
five times longer to prepare an athlete's return than another one
with the same level of complexity on federal tax issues,
according to Steve Blatt and Robert E. Harrison, part of a team
at Tanner Mainstain Blatt &amp;amp; Glynn, an accounting firm in
Los Angeles that deals with many professional athletes.
</P>
<P>
Foster said that teams usually provide their players with a
breakdown of income earned in each state, but he double-checks
the figures. Asked if calculating multiple state taxes was an
automated process after those figures are verified, he said:
"Nothing is that automated. If it were, all the ballplayers could
go to H&amp;amp;R Block."
