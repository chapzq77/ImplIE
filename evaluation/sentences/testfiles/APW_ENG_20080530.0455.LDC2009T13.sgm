Iraqi prime minister says national reconciliation nearly
completed

Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki said Friday that the
country's economic and security progress shows reconciliation
between the nation's feuding factions is almost completed.
</P>
<P>
"I'm not saying that Iraq is paradise; absolutely not," al-Maliki
told reporters in Stockholm. "There are great challenges. But I
still would like to say that violent acts have decreased by 80
percent in Iraq."
</P>
<P>
His Shiite-dominated government is under pressure to show
progress in reconciliation among the country's Sunni Arabs,
Shiites and Kurds. Iraq's Sunni Arab minority has long felt it is
being sidelined by the majority Shiites and the Kurds.
</P>
<P>
"We have come nearly to the end of the long process," al-Maliki
said at a joint news conference with Swedish Prime Minister
Fredrik Reinfeldt. "It doesn't mean that everyone gets an equal
piece of the pie, but it means that one must show a commitment
for a unified, democratic Iraq."
</P>
<P>
The largest Sunni Arab political bloc pulled its members out of
the Cabinet in August, saying it was not getting enough say in
decision-making. Sunni politicians have been negotiating a
possible return, but suspended talks this week due to a dispute
over ministry posts.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi prime minister met Swedish government and industry
officials Friday, a day after presenting his country's security
and economic progress in the past year to a U.N. conference.
</P>
<P>
Al-Maliki said the Iraqi government has earmarked funds to
facilitate the "voluntary returns" of Iraqi refugees who have
fled to neighboring countries and Europe since the U.S.-led
invasion of Iraq in 2003.
</P>
<P>
That was welcome news to Sweden, which has admitted more than
40,000 Iraqis in five years and is looking for cooperation from
Iraqi authorities to send back rejected asylum-seekers.
</P>
<P>
"This will take place if we prepare for it, especially when
security improves and when work opportunities increase," al-
Maliki said. "We hope that this is a matter that will have an
impact on the development of our relations with European
countries and also with neighboring countries."
</P>
<P>
Fewer than 1 percent of the 5.1 million Iraqis uprooted from
their homes had returned by March 31, according to the
International Organization for Migration, an intergovernmental
humanitarian group based in Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
Up to half the displaced are in neighboring countries, chiefly
Jordan and Syria. But these countries, feeling overwhelmed, have
tightened visa restrictions. Iraqis who are refugees in their own
country are feeling the pinch of high rents, lost jobs and the
disruption of their children's education.
</P>
<P>
"We have statistics that say that tens of thousands of refugees
wish to return," al-Maliki said. "We welcome them and we will
give them privileges."
