BANGKOK, Dec. 15 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's Parliament on Monday
elected Democrat Party leader Abhisit Vejjajiva as the country's
new prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Official tally results showed Abhisit gained 235 votes from the
total 437 incumbent members of parliament in the House of
Representatives, against the 198 votes for the other candidate --
Puea Thai Party leader Pracha Promnok, during the special
parliamentary session that kicked off on 9:30 a.m. (0230 GMT)
Monday.
</P>
<P>
A total of 436 MPs have cast their votes. Three MPs abstained,
including Abhisit himself.
</P>
<P>
A simple majority, which means at least 219, out of the 437 House
seats, is required for any candidate to be elected as prime
minister.
</P>
<P>
Abhisit will officially become the country's 27th prime minister
pending royal endorsement from the King.
</P>
<P>
Dozens of "red-shirt" people, who are supporters of ousted prime
minister Thaksin Shinawatra and the pro-Thaksin Puea Thai Party,
gathered outside the parliament compound. Learning the results,
the angry demonstrators were seen attacking the compound gate
with iron police barriers.
