Austrians freed by Al-Qaeda say they were treated 'normally'

Two Austrians freed by the north African branch of Al-Qaeda after
more than eight months in captivity told journalists Saturday
that while conditions were hard they were treated "normally".

Wolfgang Ebner spoke briefly to the press after attending a small
ceremony for him and his partner Andrea Kloiber at Mali's
presidential palace with President Amadou Toumani Toure and
Austrian Foreign Minister Ursula Plassnik.
</P>
<P>
"The conditions of detention were harsh, it was not at all easy
but we were treated normally," Ebner said, speaking in German.
</P>
<P>
During the ceremony Plassnik said their liberation was "a small
miracle", and added she was very relieved and grateful to the
Malian president and the authorities for their help "in making
the release possible".
</P>
<P>
Kloiber and Ebner were freed Thursday night after 252 days in
captivity. Circumstances surrounding their release remain
unclear. While Vienna denies any ransom was paid, sources close
to the negotiations say money did change hands to secure a
release.

The pair of desert hiking enthusiasts disappeared in southern
Tunisia in February as they were driving in their Austrian-
registered four-wheel-drive vehicle.
</P>
<P>
A few weeks later, Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb claimed
responsibility for their kidnapping.
</P>
<P>
The hostages were moved to northern Mali -- a region that borders
Algeria -- where the kidnappers initially demanded the release of
a number of Islamic extremists imprisoned in Algeria and Tunisia.
Later sources said there were several demands for ransom.
