Intellectual Richard Rorty, 75, Dies
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Richard Rorty, the eminent public intellectual and Stanford
University professor, who resuscitated American pragmatism with
groundbreaking work that urged philosophers to give up the
illusory pursuit of ultimate truths and concentrate on being
relevant, has died. He was 75.
</P>
<P>
Rorty died of pancreatic cancer Friday at his home on the
Stanford campus, according to the university, where he taught in
the department of comparative literature for seven years before
retiring in 2006.
</P>
<P>
Called ``an anti-philosopher's philosopher,'' Rorty was a major
American thinker whose most influential contribution was
``Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature,'' a 1979 book that marked
his shift away from the analytic tradition of G.E. Moore,
Bertrand Russell and Ludwig Wittgenstein to the pragmatist camp
of Charles Sanders Peirce, William James and John Dewey.
</P>
<P>
With this foundational change in his thinking, Rorty became a
target of prickly debate in philosophy circles and attracted
critics across the political spectrum.
</P>
<P>
``He did try to rewrite the history of philosophy a little bit.
What he accomplished,'' said Richard Watson, a longtime friend
and emeritus professor of philosophy at Washington University in
St. Louis, ``was getting himself as a philosopher taken very
seriously by people in many other fields .... He changed the
image of a philosopher in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
Rorty's desire to be relevant led him to concentrate intensely on
questions of culture and politics.
</P>
<P>
``Dick appealed to a deeper tradition in Western philosophy''
that turned philosophy into an ``inquiry into the good life, how
we can best live in political communities with respect for each
other,'' said Russell Berman, chairman of Stanford's comparative
literature department.
</P>
<P>
An unabashed liberal, Rorty articulated his view of the good life
in a prolific output of essays and articles for journals such as
Nation and Dissent. In his writings about closing the wage gap,
reducing poverty and fighting social injustice, he was critical
of America, yet he insisted that he regarded the country ``pretty
much as Whitman and Dewey did, as opening a prospect on
illimitable democratic vistas.'' His promotion of national pride
was at the center of one of his last books, ``Achieving Our
Country'' (1998).
</P>
<P>
``I think that our country -- despite its past and present
atrocities and vices, and despite its continuing eagerness to
elect fools and knaves to high office -- is a good example of the
best kind of society so far invented,'' he wrote in his book
``Philosophy and Social Hope'' (2000).
</P>
<P>
His early life as a philosopher dropped few, if any, clues of an
unusual upbringing. Born in New York City on Oct. 4, 1931, he
was, by his own account, the ``clever, snotty, nerdy only child''
of Trotskyites who worked for socialist Norman Thomas' Workers'
Defense League. As a child, he ran errands for Thomas and A.
Philip Randolph, who organized the Brotherhood of Pullman Car
Porters. By age 12 he had read the ``The Case of Leon Trotsky''
and ``Not Guilty,'' which told of the Dewey-led investigation
into the 1936 Moscow trials that found Trotsky and others guilty
of plotting Stalin's murder, and ``knew that the point of being
human was to spend one's life fighting social injustice.''
</P>
<P>
He was not only precocious but a little odd. When he was 8, he
sent a present and note of congratulations to ``a fellow 8-year-
old who had made good'' -- the newly enthroned Dalai Lama. A few
years later, he developed a passionate interest in wild orchids
and eventually found 17 of the 40 species that grew in the
mountains of northwest New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
As he later related in an autobiographical essay called ``Trotsky
and the Wild Orchids,'' these two poles of his early life went
unbound for years.
</P>
<P>
At 15 he entered the University of Chicago's experimental
Hutchins College, which admitted students with only two years of
high school. He quickly settled on philosophy as his field of
study and was taught by such influential thinkers as Leo Strauss
and Charles Hartshorne. He absorbed the Chicago philosophers'
disdain for the pragmatism of Dewey, who had been a hero to
Rorty's parents and their friends, and embraced analytic
philosophy, which was allied with science in its drive to explain
fundamental principles.
</P>
<P>
After earning a bachelor's in 1949 and a master's in 1952, Rorty
left Chicago for Yale University, where he obtained a doctorate
in 1956. He taught at Yale and Wellesley before joining Princeton
University in 1961.
</P>
<P>
At Princeton, his academic home for two decades, Rorty rose to
prominence as an analytic philosopher of language and the mind
and published his first book, an anthology called ``The
Linguistic Turn'' (1967).
</P>
<P>
Over the next decade, his early influences resurfaced and, in a
conversion that Watson described as ``fairly wild,'' Rorty found
himself being led back to Dewey.
</P>
<P>
His rediscovery of pragmatism was at the heart of ``Philosophy
and the Mirror of Nature,'' in which he wrote that the purpose of
philosophy was not to deliver eternal truths but to ``sustain a
conversation.''
</P>
<P>
He believed that philosophy should be about ``dialogue, multiple
texts ... not about a vain pursuit of absolute certainty,''
Stanford's Berman said of Rorty, who later used his elevated
status to promote the work of such continental theorists as
Jacques Derrida, the brilliant guru of deconstructionism.
</P>
<P>
``Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature'' was disparaged by many of
Rorty's fellow philosophers, who turned ``Rortyism'' into a
pejorative. As philosopher Susan Haack wrote in 1997, Rortyism
``induces a factitious despair of the possibility of real inquiry
of any kind.''
</P>
<P>
Rorty brushed off such criticisms with apparent ease. His
broadening influence was recognized in 1981, when he was named
one of the first recipients of a MacArthur ``genius'' grant,
which bestows a handsome monetary prize on individuals whose
creative work shows originality and continued promise.
</P>
<P>
The next year, 1982, he became a professor of humanities at
University of Virginia, where he remained until moving to
Stanford in 1996 as a fellow at its Humanities Center. He joined
the literature faculty in 1998.
</P>
<P>
He is survived by his wife, Mary Varney Rorty; a daughter,
Patricia; two sons, Jay and Kevin; and two grandchildren.
