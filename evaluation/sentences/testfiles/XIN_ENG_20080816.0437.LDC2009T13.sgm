BEIJING, Aug. 16 (Xinhua) -- Superman Hancock not only exists in
Hollywood movies. The 19-year-old American young man has all the
elements to be viewed a superman.
</P>
<P>
Full Name: Vincent Hancock.
</P>
<P>
Achievements: world record of men's skeet with 150 hits, or full
mark of the event; gold medals from 2005 World Championships and
four world cups from 2005 to 2008; and a new title -- Olympic
champion.
</P>
<P>
"I love winning. It is good feeling to me," he beamed after
bagging the Olympic champion, showing a pair of lovely canine
teeth.
</P>
<P>
SHOOTING NOVICE
</P>
<P>
Hancock started shooting at the age of eight, when his shooter
father Craig asked, "Do you want to try shooting'?
</P>
<P>
"Why not?" he said.
</P>
<P>
A diligent shooter, every day he shot around four or five
25-shell boxes of ammunition on the skeet field created by his
dad. After that he did other routines that helped keep his mind
sharp and his body in good form, including push-ups, pull-ups,
sit-ups and dips, as well as relaxation and visualization
exercises on his living room floor.
</P>
<P>
Three years later, the boy began appearing in competitions.
</P>
<P>
In 2005, he debuted in international arena, grabbing the gold
medal in Changwon World Cup with a surprising 149 hits, when
everybody was wondering who the kid was.
</P>
<P>
However, Hancock considered that competition hardest in his life.
</P>
<P>
"I focused on nothing but the targets," he said.
</P>
<P>
He started seven times that year in international tournament,
taking a medal each time as the first shooter ever to do so, and
was hence awarded as shooter of the year.
</P>
<P>
IMPORTANT YEAR
</P>
<P>
In 2006 the boy did two things.
</P>
<P>
One was quitting competitions to join the armed force, where he
was supposed to "train soldiers how to shoot".
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1956, the shooting squad of the U.S. armed force has
produced many ace shooters. To date, its members have achieved 21
Olympic medals.
</P>
<P>
The team members trained five days a week and five to six hours a
day. Like real soldiers, they received psychological drill as
well as physical, while psychology is important in shooting
competitions.
</P>
<P>
"I learned a lot from the army, like determination, perseverance
and discipline," he said, adding that this was helpful in his
shooting career.
</P>
<P>
As his coach Lloyd Woodhouse saw it, joining the army could put
many ace shooters together for them to compare with each other
and improve. "When you train alone, you can work really hard, but
you don't know where your problems are," he said.
</P>
<P>
The other thing Hancock did was meeting Rebekah who was from a
nurse school.
</P>
<P>
"She is a trap shooter and I saw her competing in the spring of
2006," he recalled.
</P>
<P>
Then Hancock said to himself, this is the girl I was looking for.
</P>
<P>
They held their wedding ceremony this May in Eatonton, Georgia,
this year.
</P>
<P>
SHOOTING GENIUS
</P>
<P>
Hancock said he liked the flash target used in the Beijing
Olympics, because the pink smoke made him excited.
</P>
<P>
"When I am shooting skeet, I always want to hit the center of the
plate and see how it break," he said.
</P>
<P>
The ambitious boy had his goal for this sports gala.
</P>
<P>
"I put a lot of pressure on myself, and it helped me get
determined to win," he said. "Olympics is not different from
other events, just bigger."
</P>
<P>
During competitions, he did feel nervous, rubbing his sweating
hands against his pants from time to time.
</P>
<P>
Fortunately he held his nerves, both in the final round and the
shoot-off.
</P>
<P>
When he won the medal, his mother sitting behind shedding tears,
while his 74 -year-old gray-haired coach jumped over to hug him.
</P>
<P>
"Hancock is not only talented, he is a genius," said Chinese
veteran shooter Zhang Shan, gold medalist in skeet at the 1992
Barcelona Olympics.
</P>
<P>
The big boy well remembered he once pointed at the televised
video clip of blockbuster "Hancock" to his wife. "Look, it's me,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Rebekah smiled and didn't reply.
</P>
<P>
In retrospect, no matter she agreed or not at that time, the
remarks seemed more than a joke.
