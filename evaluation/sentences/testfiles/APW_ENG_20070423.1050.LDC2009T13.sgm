Tribeca festival presents a diverse lineup for a myriad of
moviegoers

The word "tentpole" is used to describe a blockbuster movie that
can appeal to everyone. If it were applied to a festival, the
Tribeca Film Festival would be it.
</P>
<P>
The sixth annual festival opens Wednesday with a wide selection
of international art house fare, populist premieres and family
friendly films -- 157 features and 88 shorts jammed into 12 days
of screenings, panel discussions and parties.
</P>
<P>
Since being founded in response to the Sept. 11 attacks by Robert
De Niro, his producing partner, Jane Rosenthal, and her husband,
the entrepreneur Craig Hatkoff, the Tribeca festival has
gradually developed an identity as diverse as the city itself.
</P>
<P>
"We're showing everything from an avant garde film called
`Passio' with live music by Arvo Part at the Cathedral of St.
John the Divine -- to `Spider-Man 3,'" said chief festival
programmer and executive director Peter Scarlet.
</P>
<P>
"You can't get two things that are more unlike each other, but
it's that almost surreal juxtaposition of different kinds of
things that I think is an example of how we're trying to redefine
what a film festival is."
</P>
<P>
Tribeca was launched in 2002, as Rosenthal says, because of an
"act of war." She and De Niro wanted to do something to benefit
their neighborhood, just north of where the World Trade Center
towers once stood.
</P>
<P>
They began with no long-term plans, but six years later, the
festival has become an international fixture -- nestled between
the more domestic Sundance Film Festival in January and the pre-
eminent international fest, Cannes, in mid-May.
</P>
<P>
Because of its origins, Tribeca will always be defined by its
connection to Sept. 11 and the continuing reverberations of that
tragedy.
</P>
<P>
"We are a political festival," said Rosenthal in a recent
interview in her Tribeca office.
</P>
<P>
Though Tribeca in its early years intentionally opened with
heartwarming comedies like "About a Boy," last year it confronted
its history by opening with "United 93," the documentary-like
recounting of the flight that crashed in Pennsylvania on Sept.
11.
</P>
<P>
The festival has increasingly highlighted films that deal with
post-Sept.11 issues like the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. That
mission expands this year with a series of global warming-themed
short films produced by the SOS (Save Our Selves) campaign. They
will open the festival in a gala hosted by Al Gore on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"We will do things and show things and whether you like it or
not, it's something to see and it's ways to ask questions," said
Rosenthal. "We might be able to do something about climate change
quicker than we can do something about our current
administration."
</P>
<P>
Among this year's political documentaries are "Taxi to the Dark
Side" by Alex Gibney ("Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room"),
which details the policies behind the Abu Ghraib scandal; "Beyond
Belief," about two Sept. 11 widows traveling to Afghanistan; and
"I Am an American Soldier: One Year in Iraq in the 101st
Airborne," for which filmmaker John Laurence documented soldiers'
lives for 14 months.
</P>
<P>
Among the big-tent events are the U.S. premiere of "Spider-Man 3"
on April 30; the premiere of Curtis Hanson's romance "Lucky You,"
starring Eric Bana and Drew Barrymore; and one of the festival's
signature events: the Tribeca Drive-in.
</P>
<P>
"It's really a sit-in," joked Rosenthal, explaining that the
outdoor screenings are her favorite part of the festival. This
year will feature a 20th anniversary screening of "Dirty
Dancing," the animated "Surf's Up" and "Planet B-Boy," a
documentary about breakdancing.
</P>
<P>
A new addition this year also pays respect to a genre often given
scant attention at movie festivals: the sports movie. Sponsored
by ESPN, Tribeca will present 14 premieres of sports-related
films, as well as a screening of the baseball classic "The
Natural."
</P>
<P>
Serving as ambassadors of the sports festival are former National
Foortball League running back and now TV personality Tiki Barber,
and tennis legend Billie Jean King.
</P>
<P>
Movies playing in the Tribeca Family Festival include "Gumby: The
Movie" and a documentary on student council races in four
different middle schools entitled "The Third Monday in October."
</P>
<P>
A festival's merit is often measured in its ability to present
movies appealing to distributors -- it is a marketplace. The two
most successful Tribeca-showcased films are "Transamerica," which
went on to yield Felicity Huffman a best actress Academy Award
nomination, and "Jesus Camp," which received an Oscar nomination
this year for best documentary.
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to see a narrative picture break out in a mainstream
way, but that takes time," said Rosenthal. "You can't do anything
about it."
</P>
<P>
Predicting what will catch on this year is impossible, but among
the eagerly awaited films are the Leonardo DiCaprio-produced
"Gardener of Eden"; the poker mockumentary "The Grand"; and "Lady
Chatterley," an adaptation of the second version (of three) of
D.H. Lawrence's erotic novel. The film won five Cesar Awards, the
French equivalent of the Oscars.
</P>
<P>
But there are many more, from 47 countries and territories. Among
the international entries are the Turkish "Times and Winds," the
Kurdish "Half Moon" and "The Last Man," hyped as the first
Lebanese vampire movie.
</P>
<P>
The festival can similarly boast the first movie directed by Fred
Durst, frontman of rock-rap group Limp Bizkit: "The Education of
Charlie Banks." It's surely a sign that at Tribeca, everyone is
welcome.
