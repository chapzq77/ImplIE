UKRAINE, EAGER FOR TIES TO THE WEST, JOINS THE WTO

Ukraine joined the World Trade Organization on Tuesday after 14
years of negotiations, a milestone for the former Soviet republic
that helps clear the way for a valuable free trade agreement with
the European Union.
</P>
<P>
Officials in the Ukrainian capital, Kiev, suggested that the
membership represented a coming of age, of sorts, for trade
relations of former Soviet countries. The deal is expected to
lift living standards and increase investment in what is one of
Europe's poorest countries.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine -- with a population around 46 million and a gross
domestic product estimated by the World Bank at $106 billion --
became the largest former Soviet state to join the trade group to
date; Russia is negotiating for membership.
</P>
<P>
"We have difficult homework to do," President Viktor A.
Yushchenko of Ukraine said at a news conference in Geneva, where
the WTO is based, as quoted by Bloomberg News. "This starts the
colossal integration work that lies ahead."
</P>
<P>
He said membership meant "better living standards, higher wages,
improved social standards and economic life."
</P>
<P>
Trade among the former Soviet republics has often seemed chaotic,
marred by politics, fraud and strange barter deals, like a swap
in the mid-1990s when Ukraine paid for natural gas with a vast
quantity of rubber boots instead of cash.
</P>
<P>
The final hurdle for Ukraine to join the WTO was an agreement to
lower existing export tariffs on cattle, animal skins and ferrous
metals, and not to raise them in the foreseeable future.
</P>
<P>
The deal -- about three years after Yushchenko came to power in
widespread protests that became known as the Orange Revolution,
pledging to integrate Ukraine more closely with the West -- paves
the way for talks on creating a trade zone with the European
Union.
</P>
<P>
While the European bloc has declined to open membership talks, it
kept the door open for discussions on a trade pact if Ukraine
became a member of the WTO first.
</P>
<P>
The membership can be expected to give Ukraine some leverage in
settling disputes with Russia over steel, sugar and dairy
products. Though Russia is working to join the WTO, because
Ukraine is now in, it will have a veto on Russian membership.
</P>
<P>
Another Russian neighbor, Georgia, has threatened to use its veto
against Russian membership unless Moscow lifts a ban on imports
of Georgian wine, ostensibly for health reasons though more
likely a result of the souring of political relations between the
countries. Russia also bans the import of Georgian mineral water
and citrus fruit.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine will take a different tack, Irina Gerashchenko, a member
of parliament from Yushchenko's Our Ukraine party, explained in a
telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
Yushchenko's support of Russia's membership, she said, was aimed
at ushering Russia into the group as quickly as possible so that
Ukraine can avail itself of the WTO's dispute-resolution
mechanisms to resolve their conflicts.
</P>
<P>
At the signing ceremony on Tuesday, Yushchenko said that he would
support Russia's membership.
</P>
<P>
For Ukraine, he said, membership in the WTO would raise the gross
domestic product and bring additional billions in foreign
investment.
</P>
<P>
The agreement is subject to ratification by the Ukrainian
parliament, or Rada, by July 4. All major Ukrainian political
parties except the Communists support membership, but that may
not guarantee easy approval.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Yushchenko canceled a speech equivalent to
the State of the Union because opposition members of parliament
occupied the rostrum; others hung posters on the walls protesting
the president's support for joining NATO.
</P>
<P>
The speaker of parliament removed the presidential speech from
the day's agenda, and the president's press service said it would
be rescheduled. Yushchenko then flew to Geneva to sign the trade
pact.
