The Taiwan Lottery Co. (TLC) has donated NT$1.8 billion (US$56
million) from its public lottery ticket sales in December to
various public welfare projects, a TLC spokesman said Tuesday.

The contribution for the month of December has raised the
company's total contribution in 2007 to NT$15.5 billion,  the
spokesman noted.

Of the December donation, NT$908 million, or 50 percent, goes to
local governments to fund their social welfare and charity
events, the spokesman said.

Taipei County in northern Taiwan received the largest share of
NT$140 million, followed by the capital Taipei's NT$123 million.

Another NT$817 million, or 45 percent of the December total, is
used to sponsor the national pension scheme, according to the
spokesman.

The remaining NT$90.8 million, or 5 percent, is allocated as
reserve funds for the national health insurance program,  the
spokesman said.

In related news, no winner of the TLC's Super Lotto jackpot prize
-- NT$470 million -- was produced Monday for the sixth time in a
row. If no one wins the top prize, the jackpot will continue to
grow until someone wins it.
