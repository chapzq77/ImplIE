European stocks drop as Dow erases early gains

LONDON 2008-11-21 17:06:10 UTC

<P>
European markets fell further Friday as early gains on Wall
Street were wiped out amid mounting fears about the U.S. economy
and the future of banking giant Citigroup Inc. in particular.
Asian stocks closed mostly higher earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
Despite opening some 150 points higher following Thursday's 445
point slide, the Dow Jones industrial average was up only 16.09
points, or 0.2 percent at 7,568.38. Meanwhile, the broader
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index was 10.06 points, or 1.3 percent,
higher at 762.50, having ended Thursday at 752, its lowest close
since April 1997.
</P>
<P>
European stocks, which had not suffered as much as their U.S.
counterparts on Thursday, tumbled on the renewed selling on Wall
Street, with the FTSE 100 index of leading British shares closing
down 94.03 points, or 2.4 percent, at 3,780.96. Germany's DAX was
down 92.79 points, or 2.2 percent, at 4,127.41 while the CAC-40
in France was down 99.16 points, or 3.3 percent, at 2,881.26.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Asian markets recouped early losses in the wake of
Thursday's sell-off on Wall Street to end up in positive
territory. Japan's Nikkei 225 stock average rose 207.75, or 2.7
percent, to 7,910.79, and Hong Kong's Hang Seng index jumped 2.9
percent to 12,659.20.
</P>
<P>
Despite the earlier Asian gains, stock markets are generally on a
renewed downtrend, ending the week sharply lower than where they
started.
</P>
<P>
"Concerns of a more severe recession than expected, the return of
deflation fears and the lack of new effective initiatives taken
by policymakers are pushing investors to sell higher-risk
assets," said Calyon analyst Herve Goulletquer.
</P>
<P>
This week's jitters were stoked primarily by concerns about the
futures of Citigroup Inc. and the U.S. car industry.
</P>
<P>
Citigroup's future remains up in the air despite a report that
said the banking giant was considering a sale to rebuild investor
confidence.
</P>
<P>
The New York-based bank is scheduled to hold a board meeting
Friday to discuss whether to sell all or part of itself, The Wall
Street Journal reported.
</P>
<P>
But as no hard news emerged from the company about that
possibility, Citigroup's shares tumbled below $4 a share to their
lowest level in more than 15 years. That extended a sharp,
weeklong plunge that could not be stemmed by Saudi investor
Prince Alwaleed bin Talal's decision Thursday to raise his stake
in the company to 5 percent from less than 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
Investors have been worried that losses from souring debt will
swamp banks, even those given financial support from the
government's $700 billion rescue plan. Citigroup, in particular,
is a source of big concern for the markets as the company hasn't
turned a profit in the past four quarters, unlike rivals such as
JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. and Bank of America Corp.
</P>
<P>
European investors were also spooked by a survey showing that the
recession in the euro-zone may be deeper than many feared. The
monthly preliminary estimate of the purchasing managers index for
the manufacturing sector slumped to a record low of 36.2 in
November from 41.1 the previous month, while the equivalent
estimate for the services sector also dropped to a record low, at
43.3 in November from October's 45.8.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in Asia, South Korea's Kospi surged 5.8 percent and
Australia's market closed up 1.9 percent after initially falling
more than 3 percent. But mainland China's Shanghai Composite
index slipped 0.7 percent and markets in the Philippines and
Indonesia also sank.
</P>
<P>
Financial, real estate and technology stocks led the recovery in
Asia, particularly in Hong Kong, where HSBC Holdings PCL jumped
4.5 percent, China Construction Bank Corp. rose 6.7 percent and
Standard Chartered Bank increased 4.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Oil prices, which have fallen to a third of their July peak,
edged up in London trading. Light, sweet oil for January delivery
rose 30 cents to $49.72 a barrel on the New York Mercantile
Exchange after earlier falling as low as $48.25, the lowest since
May 2005.
</P>
<P>
In currencies, the dollar rose 1.3 percent to 94.81 yen while the
euro was up 1.1 percent at $1.2579.
