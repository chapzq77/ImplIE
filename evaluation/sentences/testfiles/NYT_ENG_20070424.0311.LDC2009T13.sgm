CHANGES DRIVE BACKERS FROM VOTE BILL

TALLAHASSEE A bill that would schedule Florida's presidential
primary on Jan. 29 and require a paper trail in elections took on
a life of its own Tuesday, prompting criticism from the League of
Women Voters and Democratic senators.
</P>
<P>
After Republicans added amendments dealing with voter
registration and record-keeping by election supervisors,
Democrats voted no on a bill that includes one of their
priorities: paper trails.
</P>
<P>
"We took a good cleanup of our elections system and turned it
into a political bill," said Sen. Gwen Margolis, D-Sunny Isles.
</P>
<P>
The League of Women Voters, Common Cause and AFL-CIO all
complained about an amendment that would reduce the fines for
willful violations of a law by third-party groups that register
voters, and would subject political parties to the same
penalties.
</P>
<P>
"This makes it better than it is today," said Sen. Daniel
Webster, R-Winter Garden.
</P>
<P>
The League of Women Voters successfully challenged a similar law
in court, and the state is appealing. The groups protested that
the changes were being pushed through with so little debate.
</P>
<P>
"I can't understand why you are trying to make voter registration
harder," said AFL-CIO president Cindy Hall.
</P>
<P>
The amended bill (SB 960-1010), which now heads to the full
Senate for a vote, passed an appropriations committee on a 3-2
vote. The panel's chairman, Sen. Mike Fasano, R-New Port Richey,
voted yes.
</P>
<P>
The heart of the bill was barely discussed on Tuesday. That
includes advancing the 2008 presidential primary to Jan. 29 and
using nearly $28-million in federal money to help 15 counties
switch from touch screen machines to optical scan ballots with a
verifiable paper trail.
</P>
<P>
The bill also allows minors to preregister to vote when they get
a Florida driver's license, rather than when they turn 17. The
proposal was suggested by Hillsborough County's election
supervisor Buddy Johnson.
