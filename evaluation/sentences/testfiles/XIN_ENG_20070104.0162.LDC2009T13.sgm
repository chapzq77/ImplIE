Leprosy still not eradicated, more care and support needed for
patients

BEIJING, Jan. 4 (Xinhua)
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government on Thursday urged local authorities to
step up efforts to care for leprosy patients and fight social
discrimination.
</P>
<P>
Despite sustained efforts -- and considerable success -- in
bringing the disease under control, leprosy is still a serious
disease in some parts of China and people who have been cured of
the disease continue to suffer discrimination.
</P>
<P>
As World Leprosy Day approaches on Jan. 28, the Ministry of
Health and three other departments have asked local authorities
to offer more care to leprosy sufferers by carrying out home
visits and providing new facilities.
</P>
<P>
Leprosy, which is one of the oldest recorded diseases in the
world -- first mentioned in writing in 600 B.C. -- causes
deformities and nerve damage. It incubates in the human body for
up to 20 years and is transmitted via droplets from the nose and
mouth during contact with untreated, infected sufferers.
</P>
<P>
However, it can be cured by a sustained year-long antibiotic
treatment.
</P>
<P>
China had reported and treated 500,000 leprosy cases by the end
of 2005, 60 percent of them in the nation's southwestern areas.
While the disease is under general control, the situation in some
areas is worsening, says the health ministry.
</P>
<P>
The government has asked local authorities to wage an education
campaign about the prevention and control of the disease, and
called for the eradication of discrimination against leprosy
patients.
</P>
<P>
"Society should mobilize to support and care for leprosy
patients. Their living, treatment and convalescence problems must
be actively managed," the department said in a statement on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Officials should pay visits to leprosy hospitals and families and
send them Spring Festival greetings, it says.
</P>
<P>
Last July, the health ministry published a leprosy control plan,
vowing to eradicate the disease in Anhui and Qinghai by 2008 and
in Chongqing, Guangdong and Shaanxi by 2010.
</P>
<P>
The government has been providing free treatment for leprosy
patients. But there are still 6,300 leprosy patients in the
country, and the number is currently increasing by 1,600 a year.
</P>
<P>
Most leprosy cases are found in Yunnan, Guizhou, Sichuan, Hunan
and Tibet. Children account for 2.1 percent of new cases.
