Two bear cubs born to Slovenian brown bear in France

A Slovenian brown bear imported to France last year has given
birth to two cubs, the French hunting and wildlife agency, ONCFS,
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"The two cubs were observed Monday from a great distance. They
were next to their mother and they were playing near the den,"
said Pierre-Yves Quenette, head of ONCFS.
</P>
<P>
The agency has been keeping an eye on the mother, Hvala, and
three other bears brought from Slovenia last year to France's
southern Pyrenees mountains as part of a programme to ensure the
species' survival.
</P>
<P>
Quenette said the cubs appeared to have been born in January.
</P>
<P>
Hvala was the last of the four bears to emerge from hibernation
and the only one to have given birth so far.
</P>
<P>
Anti-bear activists who claim the bears attack livestock mounted
fierce opposition to their introduction, planting traps of honey
laced with glass shards and staging demonstrations.
