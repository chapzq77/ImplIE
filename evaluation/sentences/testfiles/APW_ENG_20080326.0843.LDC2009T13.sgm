WASHINGTON 2008-03-26 15:07:23 UTC

<P>
Wrapping up a series of consultations on Iraq, President Bush met
at the Defense Department on Wednesday with the military's top
leaders to hear their views on prospects for further U.S. troop
reductions.
</P>
<P>
Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman said the president planned to
spend about two hours in a closed session with the Joint Chiefs
of Staff, the top U.S. military advisory group. Bush was
accompanied by his chief of staff, Joshua Bolten; his national
security adviser, Stephen Hadley, and Vice President Dick Cheney.
</P>
<P>
The session was to be led by Navy Adm. Michael Mullen, chairman
of the Joint Chiefs. He was presenting the consensus view of the
chiefs of the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marine Corps on Iraq
strategy.
</P>
<P>
"This is their opportunity to make (known) their views on Iraq
and the way ahead," Whitman said.
</P>
<P>
It was the last in a series of Iraq consultations by Bush with
his top advisers and commanders in advance of a decision by Bush
on how to proceed in Iraq as U.S. troops levels are declining.
</P>
<P>
On Monday Bush heard from Adm. William J. Fallon, the U.S.
Central Command chief who is relinquishing his command on Friday,
and from Gen. David Petraeus, the top commander in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Bush heard on Tuesday from Defense Secretary Robert Gates.
</P>
<P>
After Petraeus presents his Iraq progress report to Congress in
early April, Bush is expected to embrace the field commander's
desire for a temporary halt in troop withdrawals beyond those
already scheduled.
</P>
<P>
There are now 156,000 U.S. troops in Iraq. That number is
scheduled to drop to about 140,000 by the end of July. Petraeus,
with support from Gates, has said he would like to halt the
reductions at that point for a period of "consolidation and
evaluation" before resuming troop reductions.
</P>
<P>
The president is collecting advice from military leaders at a
time of turmoil in Iraq, where fighting has flared in recent days
in Baghdad as well as the southern oil port city of Basra.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki was in Basra to supervise a
crackdown against the spiraling violence between militia factions
vying for control of the center of the country's vast oil
industry located near the Iranian border. The violence has raised
fears that the cease-fire declared in August by Shiite cleric
Muqtada al-Sadr could unravel, presenting the gravest challenge
to the Iraqi government in months.
</P>
<P>
At Wednesday's session at the Pentagon, the military leaders were
expected to tell Bush how a bigger and quicker U.S. troop
reduction could help maintain the health of the entire U.S. armed
forces.
</P>
<P>
The president may also hear Gen. George Casey, the Army chief of
staff, explain his desire to reduce soldiers' tour lengths in
Iraq from 15 months to 12 months.
</P>
<P>
The president is due to give a speech Thursday on the political
and economic situation in Iraq. That would be a follow-up to his
speech last week focusing on recent security gains in the war.
