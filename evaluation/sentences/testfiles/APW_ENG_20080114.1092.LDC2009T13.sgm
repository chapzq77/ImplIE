Taiwanese President Chen Shui-bian, reeling from the loss of yet
another diplomatic ally to China, encouraged his allies on Monday
to open trade offices in China as well as maintain diplomatic
ties with Taiwan.

In an exclusive interview with The Associated Press, Chen also
said he would step back from the presidential campaign after a
landslide defeat in Taiwan over the weekend. On Saturday, Chen's
Democratic Progressive Party was devastated by the Nationalists
in legislative elections, winning only 27 of 113 seats.
