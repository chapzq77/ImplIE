GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip 2007-02-04 13:56:26 UTC

Hamas gunmen attacked bases of Fatah-allied troops with mortars
and rocket-propelled grenades early Sunday, part of a four-day
campaign by the Islamic militants to weaken the security forces
loyal to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas.
</P>
<P>
In the West Bank, a strategy session by Fatah leaders ended in a
shouting match, with some participants demanding Abbas' party
take a tougher stand against Hamas and others pushing to give a
mediation effort by Saudi Arabia a chance. In one particularly
angry exchange, participants threw an empty cup and a shoe at
each other, witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
Abbas and Hamas' supreme leader in exile, Khaled Mashaal, are to
meet in Islam's holy city of Mecca on Tuesday for reconciliation
talks hosted by Saudi King Abdullah, the highest-profile
mediation effort in several weeks of fighting. Palestinian Prime
Minister Ismail Haniyeh of Hamas also plans to attend the talks,
said Ahmed Yousef, a Haniyeh aide.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian ambassador to Saudi Arabia, Jamal Shobaki, said
the meeting will be open-ended and will focus on hammering out a
platform for a national unity government and distributing Cabinet
portfolios.
</P>
<P>
More than 130 Palestinians have been killed in the factional
fighting since May. The bloodiest round erupted Thursday, with 28
people killed and more than 230 wounded in four days. On Sunday,
two members of Abbas' Presidential Guard died of wounds sustained
in a Hamas attack on their compound Friday, hospital officials
said.
</P>
<P>
Among the dead in the weekend violence were four children.
</P>
<P>
Also Sunday, gunmen kidnapped the nephew of Fatah strongman
Mohammed Dahlan, officials said.
</P>
<P>
Since Thursday, Hamas gunmen have attacked more than a dozen
security installations in what appeared to be a systematic
campaign to weaken Abbas' control of Gaza. Late Saturday and
early Sunday, Hamas fired mortar shells and rocket-propelled
grenades at a training camp of the Presidential Guard and Abbas'
nearby office compound in Gaza City. Abbas was not in Gaza during
the current round of fighting.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Hamas gunmen ransacked a training camp of the
Preventive Security Service in northern Gaza.
</P>
<P>
Abbas-allied troops were holding their ground in most areas,
repelling the Hamas gunmen. Fatah forces also attacked two Hamas-
controlled ministries Saturday, and have repeatedly targeted a
Hamas stronghold, Gaza City's Islamic University.
</P>
<P>
Control over the security forces is central to the power struggle
between Hamas and Fatah. Hamas controls the Cabinet, including
the Interior Ministry, which is supposed to oversee some of the
security forces. But Hamas lost a power struggle for control of
the forces with Abbas last year and set up its own militia, the
5,600-strong Executive Force. Abbas, the separately elected
president, said the move was illegal.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday evening, members of Fatah's Revolutionary Council,
one of the movement's decision-making bodies, met at Abbas'
headquarters in the West Bank city of Ramallah to discuss
strategy. "We all agreed that Hamas has been trying for a long
time to impose its control on the Gaza Strip, and Fatah needs to
stand up to this policy of Hamas," said Amin Makboul, one of the
group's members.
</P>
<P>
However, participants disagreed over tactics and whether
mediation efforts were useful, he said.
</P>
<P>
In Gaza City, bursts of gunfire alternated with periods of calm.
</P>
<P>
Thunderous shooting shook one beachside neighborhood for more
than half an hour after nightfall Saturday, as Hamas gunmen
fought a local clan allied with Abbas' security forces. The
fighting continued early Sunday, with battles in nearly a dozen
locations, including the headquarters of Preventive Security in
Gaza City.
</P>
<P>
In areas not affected by the fighting, people tried to go about
their lives. Boys played soccer in the streets, horse-drawn carts
maneuvered through alleys and shoppers stocked up on supplies for
the next round of battle.
</P>
<P>
In the Sheik Radwan neighborhood, Ali Ustaz used a lull to buy a
battery-powered radio so he could follow developments despite
frequent power cuts. "There is no hope for a solution," Ustaz
said, referring to an elusive power-sharing deal between Hamas
and Fatah.
</P>
<P>
In Cairo, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak said the stalled
Mideast peace process depended on resolving the conflict between
rival Palestinian factions as well as the release of the Israeli
soldier captured by Hamas-linked militants in June.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a joint news conference with visiting German
Chancellor Angela Merkel, Mubarak said Egypt was working to "seal
the crack" between Hamas and Fatah.
