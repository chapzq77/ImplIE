LESSONS FROM ROSIE, REVISITED
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Say what you will about Judith Regan -- most people have -- she
knows her way around a rip-roaring read. The complaint in her
$100 million civil suit against the News Corp., with its riveting
passages about corporate connivance, public malfeasance and ill-
fated romance, is as much a page-turner as any of the dozens of
salacious best sellers she produced at ReganBooks, her imprint at
HarperCollins before she was fired at the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
But the deeper I went in the complaint, the more I felt I had
read this book before. The narrative -- about a talented but
unpredictable impresario who joined forces with a media company
with a great deal of fanfare before a huge, ugly divorce --
mirrored the confrontation between Rosie O'Donnell and Gruner
&amp;amp; Jahr USA in 2002. The parallels are not exact -- it was
Gruner &amp;amp; Jahr that sued O'Donnell on the grounds of
breach of contract, while Regan is the one doing the suing,
claiming that she had been defamed by News Corp. officials -- but
they are instructive, especially for the News Corp.
</P>
<P>
In the case of O'Donnell, it was her insistence on making sure
that the old McCall's magazine, renamed Rosie, reflected her take
on the world, including putting herself on the cover with an
upraised and bandaged middle finger to depict her fight against a
staph infection.
</P>
<P>
Regan, who asserted in her suit that she had sold more than $1
billion worth of books, was fired after her plans to publish a
hypothetical confession from O.J. Simpson caused an uproar, and
HarperCollins then said she had made anti-Semitic remarks during
the ensuing dust-up.
</P>
<P>
Both O'Donnell and Regan entertained settlement discussions
before deciding to press on, in part because they could not abide
by nondisclosure agreements. These are not people who go away
quietly.
</P>
<P>
In O'Donnell's case, the trial played a role in the eventual shut
down of Gruner &amp;amp; Jahr's American division. No one,
including me, is suggesting that Regan will take down a company
with a market capitalization of $66 billion. Still, what seems
like a nuisance can become a significant problem in court. The
News Corp., a tough outfit that does not embarrass or scare
easily, would still seem to have a lot more to lose than Regan.
</P>
<P>
Much continues to be made of the fact that Regan is sitting on
explosive allegations about Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of
New York and a presidential candidate. In her lawsuit, she claims
that she was encouraged to lie by a News Corp. official about the
activities of Bernard B. Kerik, a former romantic interest who
was also the former New York police commissioner, a candidate for
Homeland Security secretary and a Giuliani business partner.
</P>
<P>
She further said the company had delivered on a promise to
systematically smear her reputation if she did not go along. News
Corp. officials point out that Rupert Murdoch has never been a
supporter of Giuliani and describe the accusation as silly, but
Regan steadfastly maintains that she has the goods to support her
allegations.
</P>
<P>
"Judith Regan would not have brought this lawsuit unless she had
explicit, unambiguous evidence to back it up," said a spokesman
on her behalf.
</P>
<P>
Of course, you can say anything in a lawsuit, and Regan remains
coy about the exact nature of the accusations. A spokesman for
the News Corp. pointed out that the case was a long way from a
trial and added that the company was "highly dismissive of her
complaint and the company will vigorously defend itself in this
action."
</P>
<P>
Before the trial involving O'Donnell and her former partners --
the damages sought were also $100 million -- I can remember how
executives of Gruner &amp;amp; Jahr expressed the same kind of
confidence. Then O'Donnell went to work on the witness stand,
saying precisely what was on her mind. It was a field day for
working reporters (I was one of them), with mud and tears flying
in all directions before the presiding judge decided to put a pox
on both their houses and gave each side nothing.
</P>
<P>
But Gruner &amp;amp; Jahr USA never recovered from the trial,
which included the revelation that it had manipulated financial
and circulation figures.
</P>
<P>
If Regan and the News Corp. don't settle, the discovery and trial
could be embarrassing for reasons that have nothing to do with
Giuliani. Regan has turned down a settlement of more than $6
million, according to news articles.
</P>
<P>
It's not that her particular claims about the News Corp. have to
stick. Pull back the blankets on any enterprise -- the book
business, the movie business, what the heck, the news business --
and some common industry practices are not going to look so good
in the cold light of the courtroom. She was in a position to know
a lot, and she may be in the mood to tell all of it.
</P>
<P>
"We don't know the truth of the various allegations, but other
things may come out that are not directly related to what she is
suing for," said Mark C. Zauderer, a Manhattan trial lawyer. "You
have to consider the financial exposure versus the reputational
exposure of not settling."
</P>
<P>
Regan, perhaps more so than O'Donnell, has a penchant for
aggression matched only by a knack for surprises. After it became
apparent that the public found the idea of the Simpson book and
an accompanying interview abhorrent, she suggested that as a
victim of abuse, she had decided to "sit face to face with the
killer, because I wanted him, and the other men who broke my
heart and your hearts, to tell the truth, to confess their sins,
to do penance."
</P>
<P>
Those religious motifs were on display more recently in a short
as-told-to article in Harper's Bazaar in which she posed as St.
Sebastian, replete with bloody arrows accessorizing a fetching
white gown. "People were afraid to come to my defense, and they
betrayed me right and left," she said in the article. "They
wanted to save their own hides. Or they were promised something
better. I don't know, whatever the reason, it disappointed me to
the bone and broke my heart."
</P>
<P>
Regan's profound public woundedness has her healing on a number
of fronts, including calling on her former training in the Vassar
Madrigals to record a version of "My Way." She is said to be
contemplating recording an album of standards ("Call Me
Irresponsible" might make a good B-side to "My Way.")
</P>
<P>
She also started filming a documentary in China, and she must be
checking the Amazon best-seller list with satisfaction. The
Simpson book, "If I Did It," continues to sell, albeit for
another company and with the profits accruing to the Goldman
family.
</P>
<P>
In a sense, Regan was dispossessed for doing precisely what she
was good at, which is to pick books that stir controversy and
sales. Gruner &amp;amp; Jahr grabbed onto O'Donnell to help
revive McCall's, a dying women's magazine, because just about
everything she does kicks up public interest. But both women's
abilities to rivet public attention with their brand of
psychodrama is a weapon that will point in all directions.
</P>
<P>
So before News Corp. executives decide to tangle with Regan in
court, perhaps they should remember why they hired her in the
first place.
