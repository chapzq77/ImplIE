NASA said it was investigating technical problems with two
instruments aboard the most powerful spacecraft ever flown to
Mars.
</P>
<P>
The problems on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter first arose in
late 2006, but they worsened this year to the point where
engineers have stowed away one of the instruments.
</P>
<P>
In November, scientists operating the probe's High Resolution
Imaging Science Experiment camera noticed that the image pixels
were of poor quality. Although the problem had minimal impact on
the crisp images beamed back so far, scientists fear the problem
could grow worse.
</P>
<P>
A problem also developed in an instrument that maps the
temperature, ice clouds and dust in the Martian atmosphere.
Scientists discovered the instrument, called a climate sounder,
had a skewed field of view. The errors became more frequent last
month and engineers decided to temporarily halt work with the
instrument.
</P>
<P>
The Reconnaissance Orbiter entered orbit round the Red Planet
last year.
</P>
<P>
Since November, the probe has sent back data that could fill
nearly 1,000 CD-ROMS, tying the record of the Mars Global
Surveyor between 1997 and 2006. The Global Surveyor, which
suddenly fell silent last year after a decade of work, is
presumed dead.
</P>
<P>
The Reconnaissance Orbiter has pointed its eagle-eyed camera to
image NASA's twin rovers on the surface and landing sites of the
Viking landers and Pathfinder probe.
</P>
<P>
The Reconnaissance Orbiter, built by Lockheed Martin, is managed
by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
