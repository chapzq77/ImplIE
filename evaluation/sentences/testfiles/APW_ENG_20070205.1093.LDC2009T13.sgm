GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) -- Never mind the almost daily cease-
fire announcements. The music played on the radio stations of
Hamas and Fatah is a much better guide to war and peace.
</P>
<P>
When both Hamas's Al Aqsa radio and Fatah's Al Shabab station
played "Today is the day of rage" simultaneously a few days ago,
it was pretty clear the guns would not fall silent. At times of
heavy clashes, the playlists also include Islamic marching songs
or odes to legendary Fatah founder Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
When the two sides withdraw their forces from time to time, songs
about Jerusalem are popular, as a unifying theme. Lebanese singer
Fairouz is a favorite on Al Shabab, as a demonstration of secular
nationalist sentiment.
</P>
<P>
Radio broadcasts also air political statements and take calls
from listeners trapped at home. Trying to lower the enemy's
morale, Al Shabab reported that scores of Hamas militiamen had
defected. Al Aqsa Radio quickly retaliated with a similar report.
</P>
<P>
When a new cease-fire was announced Sunday, both stations
broadcast the same phone number for listeners to report
violations to a police operations room with Hamas and Fatah
observers. They received dozens of calls on the first day. And
resumed playing songs of national unity.
</P>

After nightfall, thunderous gunfire frequently erupted outside a
building housing visiting Associated Press staffers in Gaza City,
with some of the shooting coming from a nearby building.
</P>
<P>
It was more than just a fight between Hamas and Fatah.
</P>
<P>
The Bakr clan, clamoring for revenge, was after the killer of a
17-year-old member, Mahmoud Bakr, who died in the crossfire last
week. For four nights, dozens of masked Bakr men, armed and in
black uniforms, pinned down a dozen Hamas gunmen -- whom they
blamed for Mahmoud's death -- on a rooftop.
</P>
<P>
The fighting is increasingly about settling personal scores, and
the element of revenge will make it harder to enforce a cease-
fire, even if Hamas and Fatah are to reach an elusive power-
sharing agreement.
</P>
<P>
The grieving father, Anan Bakr, a member of the Fatah-linked
Preventive Security Service, said the battle has become personal.
"In our tradition, in our religion, whoever kills must be killed,
even after time passes," he said.
</P>
<P>

An 11-year-old boy looting floor tiles from a ransacked
Preventive Security Service compound in the northern town of Beit
Lahiya is one of the few clear winners in the factional fighting.
The boy, who wouldn't give his name because he is stealing
government property, is selling the tiles for 1.50 shekels
($0.45, 35 European cents) a piece and has also ripped 12 window
frames out of the now unguarded complex, attacked by Hamas over
the weekend.
</P>
<P>
Hamas and Fatah have fought each other to a draw after several
weeks of fighting -- though the Fatah-allied security forces took
a bad hit in the last four-day round that ended Sunday. Twenty
members of the Fatah-allied security forces were killed, compared
to four from Hamas and seven civilians.
</P>

Abdel Nasser Hamad had kept his supermarket in the beachside
Rimal neighborhood open throughout the fighting, with shutters
half closed to protect his front window against stray bullets.
For four days, he had no customers. On Sunday, the first day of a
new lull, business was still slow.
</P>
<P>
AP reporters made his day with a 300 shekel ($70, or euro54)
purchase of coffee, tea, crackers and other staples; our supplies
had run low after being confined to an apartment for four days.
Outside Hamad's store, we loaded the bags into an armored car and
drove back to the apartment. At one junction, gunmen ordered us
to stop and searched the car, apparently suspicious that we were
transporting weapons. The groceries passed the test and we were
allowed to move on.
</P>

<P>
The middle ground is not a popular place in Gaza these days.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, various groups trying to stop the fighting, including
a small Palestine Liberation Organization faction and several
NGOs, set up an open-sided tent near the parliament building and
asked passers-by to join a protest vigil. About 700 people showed
up, sitting under the tarp, shaking hands and smoking with
organizers from the "Bridge of Love" group. Hamas and Fatah can
each mobilize thousands for their rallies.
