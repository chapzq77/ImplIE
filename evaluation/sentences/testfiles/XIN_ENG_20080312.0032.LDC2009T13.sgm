HANOI, March 12 (Xinhua)

<P>
The number of prostitutes in Vietnam was estimated by the
country's Ministry of Labor, Invalids and Social Affairs at
50,000 in 2007, local newspaper Vietnam News reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
However, international nongovernmental organizations said the
figure was 80,000, said the paper.
</P>
<P>
The exact number of prostitutes cannot be ascertained, vice head
of the ministry's Department of Social Evils Prevention Le Duc
Hien said, adding that the actual number is much higher than the
one quoted.
</P>
<P>
Difficulties in addressing prostitution scourge are mainly
attributed to low fines and undue attention to education to
prostitutes, Hien said. Besides, raids often focus on
prostitution spots in large cities.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam has targeted to, this year, abolish 80 percent of
identified prostitution spots, and provide treatment and
vocational training to 70 percent of identified prostitutes, and
halve the number of those relapsing into prostitution.
