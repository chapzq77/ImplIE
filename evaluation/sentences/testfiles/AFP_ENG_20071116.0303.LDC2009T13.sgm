Iraq clamps down on security companies
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Iraqi officials have begun clamping down on foreign security
companies operating in the country following a series of
shootouts in which civilians were killed, a government official
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Interior ministry spokesman Brigadier General Abdel Karim Khalaf
told a press conference that all private security companies were
being put under the scanner ahead of the passing of a new law
that will regulate their operations.
</P>
<P>
"We formed a committee, with Colonel Ahmed Salih as a leader, to
inspect all security companies," he said. "We are building a
database on them."
</P>
<P>
He said that in addition Iraqi and US embassy officials had been
meeting to resolve issues arising from its use of controversial
private contractors, such as Blackwater and DynCorp, to guard
diplomats and other staff in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"We went to the US embassy to meet officials and agreed with them
on regulating the companies' work, their rash reactions and
inappropriate use of force," Khalaf said.
</P>
<P>
"Now a serious work has begun to regulate the work of companies
before the new law will be enacted."
</P>
<P>
He said already there were signs private guards were beginning to
behave more moderately.
</P>
<P>
"We noticed a big improvement in the companies' performances
despite some individual incidents that took place," he said.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times reported this week that the FBI had initially
found that at least 14 Iraqis were killed without justification
in a September shootout in Baghdad involving guards from
Blackwater.
</P>
<P>
In all, 17 people were killed when Blackwater private security
guards opened fire in a crowded Baghdad neighbourhood as they
protected a State Department convoy. Blackwater said the guards
came under attack.
</P>
<P>
On October 10, guards employed by Australian-managed security
firm Unity Resources Group blasted a car with automatic gunfire,
killing two women in central Baghdad. Guards said they believed
they were about to be attacked by a suicide bomber.
</P>
<P>
In the latest incident, a taxi driver was shot dead on November
10 by guards of US company Dyncorp in the north Baghdad
neighbourhood of Utafiya as they were escorting US diplomats.
Dyncorp guards too said they believed they were under attack.
</P>
<P>
A furious Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki has demanded that
Blackwater leave the country. The issue is under discussion by US
diplomats and military officials and the Iraqi government in a
joint commission set up to examine in depth the deployment of
private guards in Iraq.
