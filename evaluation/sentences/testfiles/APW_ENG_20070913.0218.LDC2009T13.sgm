NEW YORK 2007-09-13 02:09:59 UTC

<P>
Saddam Hussein's voice wafted through a courtroom as tapes were
played from a 1990 meeting with a former Texas governor and an
oilman now accused of paying millions of dollars to Iraqi
officials to illegally win oil contracts.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government entered a 10-page transcript of the December
1990 meeting. On the tapes, Saddam is heard praising former Gov.
John Connally and the Texas oilman, Oscar S. Wyatt Jr., saying
through an interpreter: "We cannot forget friends ... and we
should recall your position always."
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors say Wyatt, of Houston, cashed in on the friendship,
garnering lucrative oil contracts from the corrupt United Nations
oil-for-food program by paying millions of dollars in kickbacks
to Iraqi officials. The program, which ran from 1996 to 2003, was
created to help Iraqis cope with U.N. sanctions imposed after
Saddam's 1990 invasion of Kuwait and let the Iraqi government
sell oil primarily to buy humanitarian goods.
</P>
<P>
If convicted, Wyatt, 83, could face more than 60 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
His defense lawyers say Wyatt was a hero who persuaded Saddam to
agree at the 1990 meeting to begin releasing dozens of Americans
he had ordered held as potential shields in the event the United
States decided to invade his country.
</P>
<P>
A portion of the tape was played on the same day that the
government called to the witness stand one of its star witnesses,
Samir Vincent, who has pleaded guilty to being an unregistered
agent for Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Vincent testified that he met Wyatt for the first time on the day
the oilman and Connally met Saddam. He said he accompanied Wyatt
on as many as eight trips between 1991 and 1997, helping to
communicate with top officials in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
He said Iraqi officials liked Wyatt so much that they wanted to
reserve an oil field south of Baghdad for him in the event that
sanctions against the country were lifted.
</P>
<P>
"They thought Oscar Wyatt deserved to have this field because of
his long relationship with Iraq," Vincent testified.
</P>
<P>
The oil field could have produced as many as 300,000 barrels of
oil a day, he said.
</P>
<P>
In the transcript of the 1990 meeting, Connally told Saddam that
they had met with him as private citizens, "speaking only for
ourselves."
</P>
<P>
He said, "We are very certain that President Bush will be very
displeased that we are here at all."
</P>
<P>
Connally called Bush's views toward Iraq "hard line" and said
they did not understand why he had taken such a hard line toward
Iraq after it invaded Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
"Mr. President, it is our view that the American people are not
going to be happy to go to war over oil," Connally said.
</P>
<P>
Wyatt could be heard telling Saddam that he had visited Iraq as
many as 40 times in the previous 15 years as a businessman and
that he was "largely responsible" for a lot of the transactions
in which Iraqis sold one-third of their oil exports to the United
States.
</P>
<P>
Saddam told him that Baghdad, until 1972, was a large derelict
village.
</P>
<P>
"And now everything that you see outstanding here was built by
us," he said.
</P>
<P>
The late Iraqi leader said he was "confident that the people of
the United States, too, are keen to have peace."
</P>
<P>
Connally said the freeing of the hostages would take from the
U.S. government "one important single emotional issue that they
have competing for the American people for support against you
and your position."
