European Union officials investigate safety of Pfizer ' s anti-
smoking drug

<P>
Following reports of depression and suicide in patients taking
the anti-smoking drug Champix, the European Union's medicine
authority has begun investigating its safety.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, the European Medicines Agency asked Champix's maker,
Pfizer Inc., to submit more information about the incidences of
depression and suicide in patients taking the drug.
</P>
<P>
"Based on a preliminary review of patient reports, our committee
concluded this could signal a problem," said Monika Benstetter, a
spokeswoman for the EU agency, which authorizes medicines for use
in the 27-nation bloc.
</P>
<P>
As part of its routine drug surveillance, the agency reviewed
cases of Champix patients who had suicidal thoughts or attempted
suicide from July, October and November.
</P>
<P>
Champix was licensed for sale as a smoking cessation aid in the
European Union last September. The drug works by binding to
nicotine receptors in the brain, as well as by reducing the
symptoms of withdrawal. Champix is available as tablets, and must
be taken under medical supervision.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting this month, the EU agency concluded that "there is a
need to update the product information for Champix to warn
doctors and patients that depression has been reported in
patients who are trying to stop smoking using Champix."
</P>
<P>
Pfizer said that it is working closely with the EU agency to
review cases of depression and suicidal thoughts in patients
taking Champix. "There is no scientific evidence establishing a
causal relationship between Champix and these reported events," a
company statement said.
</P>
<P>
Experts acknowledged that establishing a causal relationship
between taking Champix and depression or suicide would be
difficult. American regulators have said that nicotine withdrawal
could aggravate existing mental problems.
</P>
<P>
But not all experts agreed. "Coming off smoking may make people
depressed, but there's little evidence for the re-emergence of
major psychiatric illness," said Dr. Peter Hajek, director of the
Tobacco Dependence Research Unit at Queen Mary University
Hospital in London.
</P>
<P>
The EU agency's decision follows reports from the United States
last month, where the drug is sold as Chantix, that at least one
patient died while taking it.
</P>
<P>
Family members of Dallas musician Carter Albrecht said the Pfizer
drug may have caused the rage that ultimately led to his death.
Albrecht was shot in the head in September by his girlfriend's
neighbor as he tried to kick down the man's door. An autopsy
report showed Albrecht's blood alcohol was three times the legal
limit.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said it asked Pfizer for
information on additional cases that might be similar.
</P>
<P>
In Europe, the EU agency has asked Pfizer to submit modified
product information next week that warns doctors and patients
about the potential for depression or suicide in patients taking
Champix. The drug's current product information does not include
any warnings about suicidal thoughts. Further action could be
taken if warranted, Benstetter said.
</P>
<P>
Hajek said that more information was needed before a real link
between Champix and depression or suicide could be confirmed. "So
far, these are just anecdotal reports," Hajek said. "We need to
see a more established pattern from more data."
