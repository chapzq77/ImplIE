Ripples of Madoff scandal spread everywhere
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK 2008-12-20 23:36:14 UTC
</P>
<P>
In the nonprofit legal center Steven Schwartz runs from a
converted furniture store in Massachussets, the e-mail was very
good news: By week's end, a check for $243,000 would be on its
way.
</P>
<P>
The money couldn't come soon enough. The sharp downturn in the
economy had put Schwartz's group -- working to improve treatment
of teen offenders with mental illnesses -- under very tight
budget pressure. At least the check was a promise he could count
on.
</P>
<P>
By that Thursday, though, events were unfolding 160 miles (258
kilometers) away that would upend those assumptions and
assurances. In a federal courtroom in lower Manhattan, a Wall
Street wizard stood before a judge, charged with running a $50
billion fraud that targeted scores of wealthy and powerful
investors.
</P>
<P>
The name of the accused, Bernard L. Madoff, meant nothing to
Schwartz and why should it? He'd never heard of the money manager
with the beachfront mansion and the 55-foot (17-meter) yacht.
They'd certainly never met. There was no reason to think they had
anything in common.
</P>
<P>
Except, it turned out, the money.
</P>
<P>
In the days since Madoff's Dec. 11 arrest, the tale has
repeatedly been told of wealthy victims who, perhaps naively,
invested their trust in a man who promised financial miracles.
</P>
<P>
But the scale of the Madoff scandal can just as well be measured
in its still-widening ripples, reaching far-flung people and
causes -- from a group helping just-released inmates find jobs in
Rhode Island to another working to provide fresh food in poor
neighborhoods in Detroit and Oakland, California.
</P>
<P>
Their future is now in jeopardy -- a painful reminder of the
financial web linking very different worlds.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
Signing up companies for office space in Manhattan skyscrapers
made Norman F. Levy a very rich man.
</P>
<P>
In the hotly competitive but tight-knit world of New York
commercial real estate, Levy worked across more than seven
decades brokering leases in midtown's towers. When he died in
2005 at 93, he was hailed as an elder statesman of the trade
whose zest for the deal was matched by his generosity with both
friendship and money.
</P>
<P>
"Your spirit and love of life have touched and changed all who
knew you," one friend of 40 years wrote in a paid death notice
for Levy that ran in The New York Times. "You taught me so much.
I'll cherish our relationship forever."
</P>
<P>
The friend was Bernard Madoff.
</P>
<P>
The real estate broker and the money manager were separated by 26
years, but they and their families had formed a friendship
reinforced by shared interests, social circles -- and trust.
</P>
<P>
Levy and Madoff were active in some of the same organizations,
like New York's Yeshiva University. They donated their money to
many of the same causes -- groups including the Lincoln Center
Theater and Gift of Life, a South Florida charity that tries to
save Jewish leukemia victims by matching them with bone marrow
donors.
</P>
<P>
In the summer, both families headed to the Hamptons. When Norman
F. Levy died, he was staying at his daughter's house fronting the
Atlantic, just a few sprawling lots away from the mansion owned
by the Madoffs.
</P>
<P>
For more than 30 years, the Levys also entrusted their personal
investments to Madoff. When they chartered the Betty and Norman
F. Levy Foundation -- which reported assets last year of $244.4
million -- as the vehicle for their charitable giving, they again
put their trust in their longtime friend.
</P>
<P>
"My father believed in Bernie Madoff," Norman Levy's son, Francis
-- who declined to comment for this article -- said in a recent
interview with FOX Business News. "The one thing he said about
Bernie (was), "If there's one honorable person, it's Bernie."
</P>
<P>
------
</P>
<P>
Francis Levy, a novelist, and his sister, Jeanne Levy Church, had
no reason to think otherwise.
</P>
<P>
When Norman Levy died, they took the helm of the family
philanthropy, leaving the funds invested with Madoff, whose
offices were housed in the same Third Avenue tower as the
foundation.
</P>
<P>
The Levy Foundation continued donations to longtime favorite
charities. But its biggest checks went to a new set of
organizations created by Norman Levy's children to champion
causes they embraced.
</P>
<P>
In 2000, Jeanne set up the JEHT Foundation, whose name is an
acronym for Justice, Equality, Human dignity and Tolerance --
originally to work on criminal justice reform, an area where
funds are scarce. Last year, the Levy family financed JEHT to the
tune of $29.9 million.
</P>
<P>
Levy Church, and her husband, Kenneth, "felt that they were
fortunate in their life to have this remarkable amount of money
and they felt they wanted to use it for less fortunate people,"
said Robert Crane, president of the JEHT Foundation.
</P>
<P>
Francis Levy co-founded the Philoctetes Center, a group dedicated
to fostering discussions of everything from literature to
economics. In 2007, the Levy Foundation financed Philoctetes with
$950,000. Last year, Francis Levy invited his family's longtime
friend, Madoff, to appear on a panel at the center to talk about
the workings of Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
More recently, the Levy Churches formed another group, the Fair
Food Foundation, based in Ann Arbor, Mich., which set out to find
ways to get fresher, healthy food to residents of poor city
neighborhoods starting with Detroit and Oakland, California.
</P>
<P>
None of the Levys' foundations are well-known to the general
public. But they got an enthusiastic reception from groups across
the country that were hungry for funding.
</P>
<P>
At the walk-in counseling office run by Rhode Island Family Life
Center in a poor neighborhood in South Providence, a JEHT grant
of $500,000 over two years paid staffers who help inmates just
released from prison find housing and jobs. In 2007, the group
provided services to 1,000 people.
</P>
<P>
A New Orleans group, Advocates for Environmental Human Rights,
used a grant from JEHT to pursue a lawsuit charging
"environmental racism" in the predominantly black Louisiana town
of Mossville, where the soil and water are polluted by 14
surrounding factories.
</P>
<P>
And in Schwartz's program in Massachusetts, JEHT offered a three-
year grant for work in Connecticut, Texas, Alabama and elsewhere
to get states to reconsider treatment of teen offenders with
mental health problems, encouraging them to send some home with
therapy or provide it in detention centers.
</P>
<P>
The JEHT grant accounted for 26 percent of the Center for Public
Representation's annual budget. Its importance became even more
clear this fall when a state tax on real estate transactions that
provides nearly as much of the group's funding dropped sharply
with the collapse of the housing market, Schwartz said.
</P>
<P>
Still, Schwartz's staff of 11 was so certain of JEHT's backing
that they moved ahead with new projects, spending about $25,000
in advance.
</P>
<P>
"We just trusted that we would get the money, and so rather than
suspend the work until the check was in hand ... we do the work
and expected the check will follow," Schwartz said.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
Crane, the director of the JEHT Foundation, was working late that
Thursday evening when his cell phone rang. His benefactors,
Jeanne and Kenneth Levy Church, were on the line.
</P>
<P>
"Are you sitting down?" they asked.
</P>
<P>
The couple told him they'd just come across a story online about
the arrest of a New York money manager whose name soundly vaguely
familiar to Crane. All the Levy Church's money was invested with
Bernie Madoff. If it was gone, so was the foundation.
</P>
<P>
On Monday morning Crane sent an e-mail to people at nearly 150
groups around the country that count on his foundation for $25 to
$30 million in funding each year. The checks they had been
expecting would not be coming, he told them, and JEHT would close
by the end of January.
</P>
<P>
Francis Levy's group, the Philoctetes Center, also announced it
could not continue without a cash infusion. The Fair Food
Foundation, announced it would close, delivering what its
president, Oran Hesterman called "a stinging blow" to activists
working to improve nutrition in poor neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of some of the groups funded by the foundations said they
had not even been aware that their money came from the Levy
family. Nor had they ever heard of Madoff.
</P>
<P>
Some groups, like the Rhode Island center that finds jobs and
housing for former inmates, were relatively lucky. JEHT provides
a third of its annual budget, but the check for 2009 had already
been cashed. The impact will become clear next year when the
group tries to replace that money in an economy that has made
fundraising increasingly difficult, Executive Director Sol
Rodriguez said.
</P>
<P>
For others, the impact was immediate. Between the JEHT closure
and the drop in tax revenues, Schwartz's group has seen 48
percent of its budget vanish. On Wednesday, he called an
emergency meeting with his staff. They've put juvenile justice
projects in Texas and Alabama on hold. But those are emergency
measures, not a solution.
</P>
<P>
"We don't have any money," he said. "I'm not sure what we're
going to do."
</P>
<P>
It's a strange paradox, Schwartz and others in his situation say.
All the attention swirling around Madoff has been about his
wealthy lifestyle and the ultra-rich investors in places like
Palm Beach and Hollywood and New York who lost their shirts. But
few seem to understand the repercussions.
</P>
<P>
"It's very ironic that the very wealthiest in the country can
have such a severe impact on kids on the low end of the totem
pole," said Mark Steward, whose Missouri Youth Services Institute
has relied on funding from the Levy family to help improve
juvenile detention centers in Santa Clara County, California,
Washington, D.C. and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
If only Madoff knew, Steward mused -- "Or maybe he does know."
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes, they just don't care."
