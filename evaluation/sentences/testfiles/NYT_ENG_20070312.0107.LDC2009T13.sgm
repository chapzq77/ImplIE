<HEADLINE>
SCIENTIST AT WORK: JOURNEYS TO THE DISTANT FIELDS OF PRIME
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES
</P>
<P>
Four hundred people packed into an auditorium at UCLA in January
to listen to a public lecture on prime numbers, one of the rare
occasions that the topic has drawn a standing-room-only audience.
</P>
<P>
Another 35 people watched on a video screen in a classroom next
door. Eighty people were turned away.
</P>
<P>
The speaker, Terence Tao, a professor of mathematics at the
university, promised "a whirlwind tour, the equivalent to going
through Paris and just seeing the Eiffel Tower and the Arc de
Triomphe."
</P>
<P>
His words were polite, unassuming and tinged with the accent of
Australia, his homeland. Even though prime numbers have been
studied for 2,000 years, "There's still a lot that needs to be
done," Tao said. "And it's still a very exciting field."
</P>
<P>
After Tao finished his one-hour talk, which was broadcast live on
the Internet, several students came down to the front and asked
for autographs.
</P>
<P>
Tao has drawn attention and curiosity throughout his life for his
prodigious abilities. By age 2, he had learned to read. At 9, he
attended college math classes. At 20, he finished his Ph.D.
</P>
<P>
Now 31, he has grown from prodigy to one of the world's top
mathematicians, tackling an unusually broad range of problems,
including ones involving prime numbers and the compression of
images. Last summer, he won a Fields Medal, often considered the
Nobel Prize of mathematics, and a MacArthur Fellowship, the
"genius" award that comes with $500,000 and no strings.
</P>
<P>
"He's wonderful," said Charles Fefferman of Princeton University,
himself a former child prodigy and a Fields Medalist. "He's as
good as they come. There are a few in a generation, and he's one
of the few."
</P>
<P>
Colleagues have teasingly called Tao a rock star and the Mozart
of Math. Two museums in Australia have requested his photograph
for their permanent exhibits. And he was a finalist for the 2007
Australian of the Year award.
</P>
<P>
"You start getting famous for being famous," Tao said. "The Paris
Hilton effect."
</P>
<P>
Not that any of that has noticeably affected him. His campus
office is adorned with a poster of "Ranma 1/2," a Japanese comic
book. As he walks the halls of the math building, he might be
wearing an Adidas sweatshirt, blue jeans and scruffy sneakers,
looking much like one of his graduate students. He said he did
not know how he would spend the MacArthur money, though he
mentioned the mortgage on the house that he and his wife, Laura,
an engineer at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory, bought last
year.
</P>
<P>
After a childhood in Adelaide, Australia, and graduate school at
Princeton, Tao has settled into sunny Southern California.
</P>
<P>
"I love it a lot," he said. But not necessarily for what the area
offers.
</P>
<P>
"It's sort of the absence of things I like," he said. No snow to
shovel, for instance.
</P>
<P>
A deluge of media attention following his Fields Medal last
summer has slowed to a trickle, and Tao said he was happy that
his fame might be fleeting so that he could again concentrate on
math.
</P>
<P>
One area of his research -- compressed sensing -- could have
real-world use. Digital cameras use millions of sensors to record
an image, and then a computer chip in the compresses the data.
</P>
<P>
"Compressed sensing is a different strategy," Tao said. "You also
compress the data, but you try to do it in a very dumb way, one
that doesn't require much computer power at the sensor end."
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
With Emmanuel Candes, a professor of applied and computational
mathematics at the California Institute of Technology, Tao showed
that even if most of the information were immediately discarded,
the use of powerful algorithms could still reconstruct the
original image.
</P>
<P>
By useful coincidence, Tao's son, William, and Candes' son
attended the same preschool, so dropping off their children
turned into useful work time.
</P>
<P>
"We'd meet each other every morning at preschool," Tao said, "and
we'd catch up on what we had done."
</P>
<P>
The military is interested in using the work for reconnaissance:
blanket a battlefield with simple, cheap cameras that might each
record a single pixel of data. Each camera would transmit the
data to a central computer that, using the mathematical technique
developed by Tao and Candes, would construct a comprehensive
view. Engineers at Rice University have made a prototype of just
such a camera.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
Tao's best known mathematical work involves prime numbers --
positive whole numbers that can be divided evenly only by
themselves and 1. The first few prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11
and 13 (1 is excluded).
</P>
<P>
As numbers get larger, prime numbers become sparser, but the
Greek mathematician Euclid proved sometime around 300 B.C. that
there is nonetheless an infinite number of primes.
</P>
<P>
Many questions about prime numbers continue to elude answers.
Euclid also believed that there was an infinite number of "twin
primes" -- pairs of prime numbers separated by 2, like 3 and 5 or
11 and 13 -- but he was unable to prove his conjecture. Nor has
anyone else in the succeeding 2,300 years.
</P>
<P>
A larger unknown question is whether hidden patterns exist in the
sequence of prime numbers or whether they appear randomly.
</P>
<P>
In 2004, Tao, along with Ben Green, a mathematician now at the
University of Cambridge in England, solved a problem related to
the Twin Prime Conjecture by looking at prime number progressions
-- series of numbers equally spaced. (For example, 3, 7 and 11
constitute a progression of prime numbers with a spacing of 4;
the next number in the sequence, 15, is not prime.) Tao and Green
proved that it is always possible to find, somewhere in the
infinity of integers, a progression of prime numbers of any
spacing and any length.
</P>
<P>
"Terry has a style that very few have," Fefferman said. "When he
solves the problem, you think to yourself, 'This is so obvious
and why didn't I see it? Why didn't the 100 distinguished people
who thought about this before not think of it?"'
</P>
<P>
Tao's proficiency with numbers appeared at a very young age. "I
always liked numbers," he said.
</P>
<P>
A 2-year-old Terry Tao used toy blocks to show older children how
to count. He was quick with language and used the blocks to spell
words like "dog" and "cat."
</P>
<P>
"He probably was quietly learning these things from watching
'Sesame Street,"' said his father, Billy Tao, a pediatrician who
immigrated to Australia from Hong Kong in 1972. "We basically
used 'Sesame Street' as a babysitter."
</P>
<P>
The blocks had been bought as toys, not learning tools. "You
expect them to throw them around," said Billy Tao.
</P>
<P>
Terry's parents placed him in a private school when he was 3 1/2.
They pulled him out six weeks later because he was not ready to
spend that much time in a classroom, and the teacher was not
ready to teach someone like him.
</P>
<P>
At age 5, he was enrolled in a public school, and his parents,
administrators and teachers set up an individualized program for
him. He proceeded through each subject at his own pace, quickly
accelerating through several grades in math and science while
remaining closer to his age group in other subjects. In English
classes, for instance, he became flustered when he had to write
essays.
</P>
<P>
"I never really got the hang of that," he said. "These very
vague, undefined questions. I always liked situations where there
were very clear rules of what to do."
</P>
<P>
Assigned to write a story about what was going on at home, Terry
went from room to room and made detailed lists of the contents.
</P>
<P>
When he was 7 1/2, he began attending math classes at the local
high school.
</P>
<P>

<P>
Billy Tao knew the trajectories of child prodigies like Jay Luo,
who graduated with a mathematics degree from Boise State
University in 1982 at the age of 12, but who has since vanished
from the world of mathematics.
</P>
<P>
"I initially thought Terry would be just like one of them, to
graduate as early as possible," he said. But after talking to
experts on education for gifted children, he changed his mind.
</P>
<P>
"To get a degree at a young age, to be a record-breaker, means
nothing," he said. "I had a pyramid model of knowledge, that is,
a very broad base and then the pyramid can go higher. If you just
very quickly move up like a column, then you're more likely to
wobble at the top and then collapse."
</P>
<P>
(END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
Billy Tao also arranged for math professors to mentor Terry.
</P>
<P>
A couple of years later, Terry was taking university-level math
and physics classes. He excelled in international math
competitions. His parents decided not to push him into college
full time, so he split his time between high school and Flinders
University, the local university in Adelaide. He finally enrolled
as a full-time college student at Flinders when he was 14, two
years after he would have graduated had his parents pushed him
only according to his academic abilities.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
The Taos had different challenges in raising their other two
sons, although all three excelled in math. Trevor, two years
younger than Terry, is autistic with top-level chess skills and
the musical savant gift to play back on the piano a musical piece
-- even one played by an entire orchestra -- after hearing it
just once. He completed a Ph.D. in mathematics and now works for
the Defense Science and Technology Organization in Australia.
</P>
<P>
The youngest, Nigel, told his father that he was "not another
Terry," and his parents let him learn at a less accelerated pace.
Nigel, with degrees in economics, math and computer science, now
works as a computer engineer for Google Australia.
</P>
<P>
"All along, we tend to emphasize the joy of learning," Billy Tao
said. "The fun is doing something, not winning something."
</P>
<P>
(END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
Terry completed his undergraduate degree in two years, earned a
master's degree a year after that, then moved to Princeton for
his doctoral studies. While he said he never felt out of place in
a class of much older students, Princeton was where he finally
felt he fit among a group of peers. He was still younger, but was
not necessarily the brightest student all the time.
</P>
<P>
His attitude toward math also matured. Until then, math had been
competitions, problem sets, exams. "That's more like a sprint,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Tao recalled that as a child, "I remember having this vague idea
that what mathematicians did was that, some authority, someone
gave them problems to solve and they just sort of solved them."
</P>
<P>
In the real academic world, "Math research is more like a
marathon," he said.
</P>
<P>
As a parent and a professor, Tao now has to think about how to
teach math in addition to learning it.
</P>
<P>
An evening snack provided him an opportunity to question his son,
who is 4. If there are 10 cookies, how many does each of the five
people in the living room get?
</P>
<P>
William asked his father to tell him. "I don't know how many,"
Tao replied. "You tell me."
</P>
<P>
With a little more prodding, William divided the cookies into
five stacks of two each.
</P>
<P>
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</P>
<P>
Tao said a future project would be to try to teach more non-
mathematicians how to think mathematically -- a skill that would
be useful in everyday tasks like comparing mortgages.
</P>
<P>
"I believe you can teach this to almost anybody," he said.
</P>
<P>
But for now, his research is where his focus is.
</P>
<P>
"In many ways, my work is my hobby," he said. "I always wanted to
learn another language, but that's not going to happen for a
while. Those things can wait."
