Singapore says will study kidney donor payments to meet demand

<P>
Singapore will study the possibility of paying some kidney donors
to help meet demand for kidney transplants, the city-state's
health minister said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Health Ministry will examine the feasibility of providing
payments to unrelated donors to augment the supply of kidneys,
Khaw Boon Wan said in Parliament, acknowledging that the
suggestion has stirred controversy.
</P>
<P>
"We should not reject any idea just because it is radical or
controversial," Khaw said. "We may be able to find an acceptable
way to allow a meaningful compensation for some living, unrelated
kidney donors, without breaching ethical principles or hurting
the sensitivities of others."
</P>
<P>
Khaw said the ministry would review possible changes to current
legislation to allow payments for donations from third parties
such as those from the charity and religious sectors. Such a
change would need to be approved by Parliament to become law.
</P>
<P>
"There are desperate patients out there wishing to live and
desperately poor people willing to exchange a kidney for a
hopefully improved life," he said. "Criminalizing organ trading
does not eliminate it ... it merely breeds a black market."
</P>
<P>
Khaw said the Health Ministry would also push to amend existing
laws on organ transplants to remove an age limit on deceased
donors, currently set at 60 years, because "the suitability of
the organ depends on its condition rather than the age of the
donor."
</P>
<P>
The Health Ministry will look into matching patients with donors
by setting up a registry of possible donors, he said.
</P>
<P>
The two initiatives should enable Singapore to carry out 70
percent of the kidney transplants needed every year -- up from 50
percent currently, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
He said about 1,000 new cases of kidney failure are diagnosed
every year, with nearly 40 percent unable to survive the first
year.
</P>
<P>
Khaw's comments follow the cases of two Indonesian men who were
jailed and fined by a Singapore court earlier this month after
being convicted of agreeing to sell their kidneys to two patients
in the city-state.
</P>
<P>
Selling or buying organs or blood is illegal in Singapore, as in
many other countries, and carries a penalty of up to 12 months'
jail, or a fine of up to 10,000 Singapore dollars (US$7,405), or
both.
