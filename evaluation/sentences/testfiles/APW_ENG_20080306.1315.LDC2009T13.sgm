The Defense Department has banned Google Earth teams from making
detailed street-level video maps of U.S. military bases.
</P>
<P>
A message sent to all Defense Department bases and installations
around the U.S. late last week told officials to not allow the
popular mapping Web site from taking panoramic views inside the
facilities.

Michael Kucharek, spokesman for U.S. Northern Command, told The
Associated Press on Thursday that the decision was made after
crews were allowed access to at least one base. He said military
officials were concerned that allowing the 360-degree, street-
level video could provide sensitive information to potential
adversaries and endanger base personnel.

His comments came just a few days after published reports
suggested that protesters used Google Earth to help plot their
access to the roof of the Parliament building in London.
