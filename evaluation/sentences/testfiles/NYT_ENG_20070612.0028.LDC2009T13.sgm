GONZALEZ DOUBLES DODGERS '  PLEASURE
</HEADLINE>

LOS ANGELES
</P>
<P>
Luis Gonzalez wouldn't say his pride had been wounded, because to
admit that would have been to wound it further.
</P>
<P>
But for an accomplished veteran with an eye on Cooperstown who
claimed to have simply shrugged off the indignity of having been
pinch hit for in the eighth inning of a close game, the Dodgers
left fielder sure had a vivid recollection of the moment, despite
the more than two weeks that had passed.
</P>
<P>
"And I hit that guy well, too," Gonzalez said after Monday
night's game, a badly needed 5-3 victory over the New York Mets
in front of 40,467 at Dodger Stadium. "But it was no big deal.
I'm not the manager, and I don't care what happens with the
lineup. (But) obviously, I want to be hitting in that situation."
</P>
<P>
There is one other thing Gonzalez still won't admit about that
moment, which occurred in a loss to the Chicago Cubs on May 26,
when Jeff Kent was summoned off the bench to face Will Ohman with
the bases loaded and two outs, only to take a called third
strike.
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez won't admit it had anything to do with a personal
resurgence that already had begun in the days leading up to that
game, but that seemed to hit full stride immediately thereafter.
</P>
<P>
At this stage of his career, and with his 40th birthday looming
later this summer, Gonzalez doesn't need personal affronts to get
him going. Thus, it must be a coincidence that in the 14games
since that one, Gonzalez is batting .358 (19 for 58) with three
of his eight home runs and eight of his 14 doubles.
</P>
<P>
That includes his two most recent two-baggers, both off quirky
Mets right-hander Orlando "El Duque" Hernandez. One keyed a
three-run, score-tying rally in the fourth inning, and the other
kicked off a two-run sixth that carried the Dodgers to arguably
their most desperately needed win of the season.
</P>
<P>
Those doubles also carried Gonzalez past Dodgers hitting coach
Eddie Murray into 19thplace on the all-time career list with 561.
</P>
<P>
"Eddie was great," Gonzalez said. "We took a couple of photos
afterward, just memories for me to put up in my home later on
down the road. I have always been a doubles hitter. I think the
art of doubles has been lost the last 10 years, because everyone
is more concerned with home runs. I have always thought doubles
kept rallies going, but home runs pay more.
</P>
<P>
"But the important thing for us was that it was just nice to
win."
</P>
<P>
Even last season, when Gonzalez was deemed by some -- especially
by the management of the Arizona Diamondbacks, which decided not
to re-sign him after eight productive seasons there -- to be
declining with age, he slammed 52 doubles. They were as much a
reason as any why the Dodgers chose to snatch him up for one year
and $7.35 million.
</P>
<P>
But after a slow start in which he made too many early-count outs
and didn't produce nearly as much as a fifth-place hitter should,
Gonzalez put in countless hours in the cage, much of them under
the discerning eye of the man whom he would soon pass on that
all-time doubles list. The result has been what at worst could be
described as a hot streak.
</P>
<P>
And what at best could be described as the rebirth of a career.
</P>
<P>
"He has had it right there for a while, and he worked hard to get
there," Dodgers manager Grady Little said. "He is seeing more
pitches, and a lot of times, when pitchers make tough pitches to
this guy, he fouls them off. He isn't swinging and missing at
them. He fouls them off until he gets something he can handle."
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez's first double drove in Russell Martin, slicing what had
been a 3-0 Mets lead to 3-2 and continuing the all-too-rare rally
that began with a walk by Juan Pierre, just his 10th in 280plate
appearances. Andre Ethier, who came to idolize Gonzalez while
playing at Arizona State, then picked up Gonzalez with an RBI
single to left, tying the score.
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez's other double, the one that pushed Murray to 20thplace,
led off the sixth inning with the score still tied. One out
later, promising rookie James Loney -- another guy who figures to
make a nice career out of plugging gaps and taking two -- doubled
to the wall in left-center, scoring Gonzalez with the go-ahead
run.
</P>
<P>
Loney later scored on Wilson Betemit's pinch-hit single, giving
the Dodgers all the insurance they would need to move within a
game of Arizona and San Diego for first place in the National
League West.
