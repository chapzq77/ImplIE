FAMILY-OWNED FIRM TRIES TO PASS ON SOCIAL VALUES
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOLLAND, Mich.
</P>
<P>
Right up there with putting an aging parent in a nursing home
stands the wrenching job of handing over a family business to be
run by outsiders.
</P>
<P>
It happens to any family firm that lasts long enough, from Wal-
Mart Stores on down. And, as the experience of the 102-year-old
Louis Padnos Iron &amp;amp; Metal Co. shows, the transition can
be as quirky as the founding family.
</P>
<P>
The Padnos' problem is an age gap. Third-generation members who
run the scrap-metal company, which employs about 400 people and
has annual sales of about $300 million, are in their 50s. They
want to work less. But the fourth-generation Padnoses who might
someday want to run the place are still only in their teens.
</P>
<P>
So, the company hired a local philosophy professor, a man who
also spends time tutoring convicts at a nearby state prison in
classic literature and other topics, to help groom six hired
managers to become, well, more Padnos-like.
</P>
<P>
What does that mean? For starters, as the Padnoses themselves
point out, they are politically liberal, Jewish and, having grown
up wealthy enough to travel widely, they are worldly. Mitchell W.
Padnos, one of four third-generation owners who run the company,
worked after college at a Barcelona, Spain, steel mill. His
cousin, Jeff Padnos, now the company president, once gave a
speech to a Katmandu, Nepal, science club in the middle of a six-
month around-the-world vacation before starting business school,
he said.
</P>
<P>
The managers, on the other hand, are mostly conservative, from
Protestant backgrounds with working class-roots, and have spent
much less time outside western Michigan.
</P>
<P>
"We just happen to be a Jewish family sitting in the middle of
this," said Mitch Padnos, growing up and living in an area that
has historically been heavily Dutch. He added that the elder
Padnoses expected their children to behave in ways that reflected
well on their religion. "My dad was very sensitive," he said.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the third-generation Padnoses view themselves as
part entrepreneurs, part social workers. And it is the latter
quality they seem most eager to pass along to the managers. "I'm
becoming more and more missionary-like," said Jeff Padnos. "Doing
business right really is like applied religion."
</P>
<P>
He said he recently agreed to hire a man with a criminal record.
If it works out, he said, "you remember that better than any buy-
low, sell-high deal you've made." The company said it had never
laid off workers.
</P>
<P>
A family foundation holds about $7 million and contributes to
many local organizations each year. The Padnos name is all over
western Michigan, adorning the Amtrak station here, the
engineering school at nearby Grand Valley State University and
sculpture gardens in the area.
</P>
<P>
"They're wonderful benefactors," said the mayor of Holland, Al
McGeehan.
</P>
<P>
Sure, the Padnoses could sell the company and probably collect
considerably more than $100 million. But selling, said Mitch
Padnos, would make him just another idle rich guy. "I have
friends who have no place to go every day," he said. "Once you've
sold your business, you're done."
</P>
<P>
Many entrepreneurial dynasties build family customs around the
business itself, meaning a sale can emotionally upend the family.
"It's really a quagmire," said Ted Clark, executive director of
the Northeastern University Center for Family Business. "We hear
all the time: I never want to sell."
</P>
<P>
Thus three years ago, the Padnoses began talking to the managers
about taking on more responsibility and perhaps one day running
the company. "The first thing they all said was, 'OK, when?"'
said Shelley Padnos, Mitch's sister.
</P>
<P>
She went to a business ethics seminar two years ago and met the
speaker, Michael DeWilde. He teaches philosophy at Grand Valley
State. A former carpenter and labor organizer, he became known in
the Grand Rapids area for a program that brought literary
classics to groups that normally do not read them, including some
prisoners.
</P>
<P>
Shelley Padnos was impressed, and invited DeWilde to meet with
the managers. They communicated poorly with one another, often
running problems through a family member, she said. She said she
felt they were uncomfortable with ambiguity and saw issues as
black and white. And she worried their conservatism would change
the way Padnos was run.
</P>
<P>
"They would tell you, 'God helps them who help themselves,"' she
said. In her view, though, "that only works if the playing field
is level."
</P>
<P>
"They need to be exposed to the big wide world," Shelley Padnos
recalled thinking. "It is not unusual to grow up in Holland and
think most of the world is Christian Reformed and white."
</P>
<P>
The managers, mostly in their 30s, grew up in the area, went to
college and, after a job or two, came to Padnos. Al Tomes,
director of operations and a 16-year Padnos employee, grew up in
a one-stoplight town near here, where his parents operated a
campground, he said.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
Before enlisting in the Army and graduating from college, Tomes
said, he mulled a career at his hometown grocery store. But he
decided he would always be beneath the owner's several children.
"There just wasn't going to be room," he said.
</P>
<P>
Perhaps it is too easy for the Padnoses to think of the managers
as still-developing personalities, rather than merely as fellow
adults with a different point of view. "We all came in here
young," said Matthew Heitmeier, a manager who buys and sells
metals for Padnos. "It's a parent-child relationship. I don't
think we're as closed-minded as they think we are. They hire
conservative people. They want us to appreciate the liberal
mindset."
</P>
<P>
(END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
When DeWilde, the professor, started meeting with the managers
every two weeks in September 2005, he said they initially focused
on traditional career concerns. Some saw the meetings as a way to
advance themselves as candidates to run the company.
</P>
<P>
Over time, however, they were convinced that the Padnoses had no
intention of naming a single heir apparent. The four family
members practice an unusually democratic management. Each is paid
exactly the same, and no major decision is made unless all four
agree.
</P>
<P>
Beginning to think like a team, the managers offered each other
constructive criticism.
</P>
<P>
They told Scott O'Neil, the sales manager, that he shoots from
the hip at times.
</P>
<P>
They told Al Tomes to dress more nicely and work on his grammar.
</P>
<P>
And O'Neil told Timothy Beers, who manages administrative
functions, to stop hanging around the office into the evening
just because Jeff Padnos stays late. "Tim was always there,"
O'Neil said. Beers denied hanging around unnecessarily.
</P>
<P>
The managers were assigned readings of Thoreau, Sophocles and a
recent essay on Freud. They spent a long weekend in Chicago
seeing plays, touring exhibitions of art and architecture and
eating at fancy restaurants. And in recent weeks they have
debated how to give away $40,000 of the Padnos' money, an
exercise in becoming philanthropists.
</P>
<P>
Beers, a 12-year Padnos employee, said, "I've enjoyed it. But it
hasn't been an easy transition. While you're sitting there
watching a Shakespeare play, it's hard not to think about all the
things you could be getting done at work."
</P>
<P>
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
The founder, Louis Padnos, fled Russia at age 13, made his way to
Amsterdam, Netherlands, learned to speak Dutch and got on a ship
to the United States. He had relatives in Chicago. He became a
junk peddler, common work among Dutch immigrants at the time.
Because he did not speak English, someone suggested that he move
across Lake Michigan to Holland, the Dutch enclave.
</P>
<P>
From a cart and later a horse and wagon, his business prospered.
He essentially scoured the area for scrap metal and other
discards, then sold the stuff to mills as raw material. Two sons
joined and expanded the business. By 1979, Mitch and Jeff Padnos,
cousins, joined their fathers. Shelley and Jeff's brother, Doug
Padnos, joined later.
</P>
<P>
It remains a tough business, and it is dangerous. Two workers
died at Padnos plants in recent years. One was hit last year by a
giant blade he was changing on a metal shredder. The other was
run over in 2001 by a freight train as he swept scraps away from
the tracks.
</P>
<P>
Scrap prices, meanwhile, move wildly, and a dealer stuck with a
lot of inventory in a plunging market can be wiped out. Padnos
will not disclose profits on its annual sales of about $300
million. However, if its profit margin last year roughly matched
the industry's biggest company, Metal Management, Padnos could
have had after-tax profit of $15 million to $20 million.
</P>
<P>
The managers, implored to "act like owners," do not see the
financial statements, and that irks some of them.
</P>
<P>
"If they want these people to be more like them, they need to
have access to the same information," said Clark, the
Northeastern University family business director. Without the
context of financial information, he added, the managers cannot
be expected to make informed decisions.
</P>
<P>
"It's an inconsistency," Jeff Padnos conceded. "It's something we
wrestle with."
