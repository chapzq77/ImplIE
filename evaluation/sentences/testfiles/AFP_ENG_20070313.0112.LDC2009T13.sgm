Major threat to Mugabe from within own party: analysts by Fanuel
Jongwe
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The major threat to Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe comes from
disgruntled members of his ZANU-PF party upset with his plans to
extend his rule rather than the official opposition, according to
analysts.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe, the 83-year-old who has ruled Zimbabwe since independence
in 1980 from Britain, has attracted widespread international
criticism for ordering a brutal crackdown on the opposition.
</P>
<P>
But while Morgan Tsvangirai, leader of the main opposition
Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), may be attracting the
headlines after his arrest and alleged beating, a bigger danger
to Mugabe's rule lurks closer to home.
</P>
<P>
"Mugabe is facing greater opposition than at any other time
within ZANU-PF," said Takavafira Zhou, a political analyst and
history lecturer at Masvingo State University in southern
Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe revealed in an interview over the weekend that he would
like to stand for another six-year term of office in 2008 which
would mean he would be aged 90 by its completion.
</P>
<P>
His comments come as his Zimbabwe African National Union-
Patriotic Front is considering an earlier call by Mugabe for the
2008 presidential polls to be held over until 2010, ostensibly to
coincide with parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
While the ZANU-PF annual conference in December did pass a number
of resolutions backing such a delay, the move still needs
approval from the powerful central committee and parliament.
</P>
<P>
Zhou said a decision by Mugabe to stand in presidential elections
in 2008 was a result of simmering opposition in the ruling party
to the plan to postpone the presidential elections by two years.
</P>
<P>
"There is a feeling within ZANU-PF that he should step down in
2008 as he indicated. There are about three factions now jostling
for the post but the problem is that no-one has emerged so far
who commands the respect Mugabe commands in ZANU-PF."
</P>
<P>
Elphus Mukonoweshuro, a political science professor at the
University of Zimbabwe, said ZANU-PF had been split since Mugabe
suggested three years ago that he would step down at the end of
his current term and senior members of the party started jostling
to succeed him.
</P>
<P>
When Joyce Mujuru was elevated to vice-president in December
2004, Mugabe appeared to have annointed her as his successor,
saying she was destined for higher office.
</P>
<P>
"Mugabe locked himself into an irreversible groove to departure,"
Mukonoweshuro said. "Now he is trying to undo it. His party is
split and he appears to have run out of any strategy to wield
together a sustainable coalition of support.
</P>
<P>
"The factions have weakened Mugabe's support base. He has been
reduced to a weak leader struggling to build his own independent
faction."
</P>
<P>
Relations with Mujuru appear to have significantly cooled, and
she was noticeably from Mugabe's birthday celebrations last
month.
</P>
<P>
A recent report by the International Crisis Group, a Brussels-
based thinktank, said that Mujuru's husband Solomon was "leading
the campaign to force Mugabe into retirement when his term
expires in 2008."
</P>
<P>
"ZANU-PF officials say Mujuru's argument resonates with other key
party leaders, though many are afraid to openly denounce Mugabe's
proposal," the ICG added.
</P>
<P>
While Mugabe has had to endure a raft of public sector strikes,
the security forces have so far remained loyal to him.
</P>
<P>
Zhou said that their continued support was crucial to Mugabe's
survival strategy and saw little sign of their changing sides.
</P>
<P>
"If the armed forces take sides with him, he will use the armed
forces against the internal opposition," said Zhou.
</P>
<P>
"If the armed forces join the side of the one of the factions,
then the armed forces could also turn against him. This is highly
unlikely, considering the history of the armed forces."
