Oil price rise hits British Airways Q1 profits

British Airways PLC reported a huge fall in its first quarter
earnings on Friday, as chief executive Willie Walsh said a
combination of soaring oil prices and a global economic slowdown
presented "the worst trading environment the industry has ever
faced."
</P>
<P>
BA also announced cuts to its winter flight schedule in a bid to
reign in spending in the tough trading climate -- cuts that led
the carrier to trim its full-year forecast for revenue growth to
3 percent, instead of 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
In a trading update, BA said that its pretax profit in the three
months to June 30 was 37 million pounds (US$73 million) -- an 88
percent plunge from the 298 million pounds it earned in the same
period a year ago.
</P>
<P>
Total revenue was up 2.8 percent over the period, but weaker
consumer confidence meant that planes over the quarter traveled
73.4 percent full -- a 3.4 percent drop from the same period last
year.
</P>
<P>
"We are in the worst trading environment the industry has ever
faced," said BA chief executive Willie Walsh. "The combination of
unprecedented oil prices, economic slowdown and weaker consumer
confidence has led to substantially lower first quarter profits."
</P>
<P>
BA said its fuel bill surged 49 percent over the quarter and
Walsh warned that flight ticket prices would have to rise across
the industry as the hedging positions against high oil prices put
in place by most airlines begin to unwind.
</P>
<P>
"It is absolutely unavoidable that as hedging unwinds we will
have to reflect the significant increase in the price of oil in
our fares," Walsh said.
</P>
<P>
Walsh added that BA's planned merger with Spanish carrier Iberia
SA was a positive step for both carriers "particularly against
the background of the industry outlook."
</P>
<P>
Asked about job losses, Walsh said combining the two airlines in
the current economic climate would make BA and Iberia "much
stronger."
</P>
<P>
"If people are concerned about jobs, that can only be good news,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Walsh said the airline had revised its capital expenditure plans
to focus on cost control, but said that it had ordered six new
Boeing 777-300ER aircraft for delivery beginning in 2010.
</P>
<P>
The new Boeing aircraft are 23 percent more fuel efficient than
the Boeing 747-400s in BA's current fleet and will give the
airline additional flexibility in the longhaul fleet.
</P>
<P>
"We see new fuel efficient aircraft as being a critical part of
the answer to high oil prices," Walsh said.
</P>
<P>
BA did not provide net profit figures in the trading update to
the London Stock Exchange.
