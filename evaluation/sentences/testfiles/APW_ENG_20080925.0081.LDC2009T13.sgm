AP Interview: Mugabe urges West to lift sanctions

<P>
Zimbabwe's president said Wednesday he sees no obstacles to
carrying out a power-sharing agreement with rivals and hopes it
will lead the West to ease sanctions, which he blamed for
devastating the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with The Associated Press, the 84-year-old Robert
Mugabe was sharp, quick and animated -- and made clear he is
determined to remain president despite what he said were efforts
by Britain and the United States to oust him.
</P>
<P>
"They are waiting for a day when this man, this evil man, called
Robert Mugabe is no longer in control," he said. "And I don't
know when that day is coming."
</P>
<P>
So he has no thoughts of resigning?
</P>
<P>
"No -- or a thought of dying," Mugabe chuckled.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe, who is to address the U.N. General Assembly on Thursday,
dismissed Western reports that the Sept. 15 power-sharing deal
could fall apart "because I don't know of any hitch."
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, Mugabe remains president but is supposed to
cede some of the powers he has wielded for nearly three decades
in the southern African country. Long-simmering and bitter
differences as well as the nation's economic collapse, though,
have put the deal under intense pressure.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe said Wednesday the only outstanding issue is deciding on
four of the 31 Cabinet posts, and the negotiations are continuing
in Harare while he is in New York. He declined to say which posts
are still being discussed.
</P>
<P>
The agreement provides for 15 nominated by Mugabe's party, 13 by
opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai and three by the leader of a
smaller opposition faction, Arthur Mutambara.
</P>
<P>
"Every one of us is actually positive about the agreement, or the
need to cement the agreement and make it work," Mugabe said.
</P>
<P>
"I don't see any reason why we can't work together as
Zimbabweans," he said. "We are all sons of the soil, as we say,
and the differences arise purely from own conceptions of what
Zimbabwe should be and what the government of Zimbabwe should
be."
</P>
<P>
Tsvangirai won the most votes in March presidential polling, but
not enough to avoid a runoff against Mugabe. An onslaught of
violence against Tsvangirai's supporters led him to drop out of
the presidential runoff and Mugabe was declared the overwhelming
winner of the second vote, which was widely denounced as a sham.
</P>
<P>
More than 100 opposition supporters were killed in the violence,
thousands of people were beaten up and suffered broken limbs, and
tens of thousands were forced from their homes.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe, who has been in power since independence from Britain in
1980, and Tsvangirai have been enemies for a decade. Tsvangirai
has been jailed, beaten, tortured and tried for treason --
charges that were dismissed in court.
</P>
<P>
But Mugabe made clear Wednesday that he was willing to share
power with Tsvangirai, who would become prime minister under the
agreement, leading a council of ministers responsible for
government policies and reporting to a Cabinet headed by Mugabe.
</P>
<P>
Still, Mugabe did not spell out who would have the final say if
there was a major disagreement. And while he repeated several
times that all parties want the agreement to work, Mugabe
dismissed Tsvangirai's Movement for Democratic Change as a
creation of Britain's three major parties and beholden to its
government.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe described Zimbabwe's government as a pyramid with the
president at the top, but he said "the president never settles on
the matter alone," and always works with the vice presidents.
</P>
<P>
"And now that we have a prime minister we rope him in and we
discuss in the presidency, or whatever we call it, together, and
we look at the issues and see what solutions can be applied to
any problem that confronts us," Mugabe said.
</P>
<P>
The power-sharing deal was mediated during months of negotiations
by Thabo Mbeki, who has been forced to step down from the South
African presidency by the country's ruling party.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe said it was up to the Southern African Development
Community to decide whether Mbeki continued as mediator. But the
Zimbabwean president offered praise, saying Mbeki has been "quite
excellent."
</P>
<P>
"There is a man who has been in the seat for so many years as the
father of the African National Congress and democracy in one
stroke pulls him down," Mugabe said of Mbeki. "Democracy without
morality is no democracy for all."
</P>
<P>
Tsvangirai has repeatedly said he does not want a legal witch
hunt in Zimbabwe, but that he believes some kind of truth and
reconciliation process is necessary to allow healing after years
of violence and repression. Mugabe disagreed.
</P>
<P>
"At the moment, the fight between us has been one between Britain
and ourselves -- Britain, of course, using as their front the
opposition," Mugabe said. "So the British and the Americans,
they've got to be reconciled to us."
</P>
<P>
Western nations, who have shunned Mugabe's government and whose
aid and investment are sorely needed, have reacted cautiously to
the coalition agreement. Millions of dollars in aid are expected
to flow in if Mugabe actually shares power.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe said Wednesday the West should now begin removing
"demonic" sanctions, which have targeted individuals and
companies seen to be supporting his regime. They were tightened
after elections this spring and the European Union recently added
an arms ban.
</P>
<P>
"We don't expect investment from countries that are hostile,"
Mugabe said. "They can keep their investment, but we would hope
in the first place that sanctions would be lifted. There is no
reason for imposing sanctions on Zimbabwe at all. There has never
been any reason for it, you see, except hostility."
</P>
<P>
European Union foreign ministers have welcomed the power-sharing
deal but have said that Mugabe must prove he is willing to
restore democratic rule before EU sanctions can be lifted.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe has the world's highest inflation rate even by the
official figure of at 11 million percent, and independent
economists put it much higher.
</P>
<P>
Critics have linked Zimbabwe's economic slide to Mugabe's 2000
order that commercial farms be seized from whites. Mugabe says
the land reform program was meant to help poor blacks and blames
the country's economic collapse on Western sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Food, fuel, hospital supplies and other necessities are scarce as
prices skyrocket in the region's former breadbasket. And millions
of Zimbabweans, including doctors, teachers, business owners and
others with important skills, have fled the country.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe said Wednesday that Zimbabwe can return to its former
economic status, saying "if only the West can leave us alone, you
will certainly see us come up."
</P>
<P>
"It will take us time because we have lost some time because of
sanctions," he said.
</P>
<P>
While critics have complained about Zimbabwe's human rights
record, Mugabe said the African Union and southern African
leaders have not. When asked whether he would allow Human Rights
Watch and Amnesty International to come in, he replied: "Ha! Ha!
Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Let them keep out."
</P>
<P>
Mugabe also dismissed calls from those who say he should be tried
for human rights abuses.
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure they forget I am not Mr. Bush who invaded Iraq ...
Probably they mistake me for him. Isn't that the man who should
be tried before I am tried?"
