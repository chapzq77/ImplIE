McCain gets tough questions from New Hampshire students on age,
conservatism

CONCORD, New Hampshire 2007-09-04 15:18:59 UTC
</P>
<P>
Republican presidential hopeful John McCain was told Tuesday by
New Hampshire high school students he might be too old to lead
the U.S. and too conservative to be respected.
</P>
<P>
McCain, the Arizona senator whose presidential bid has stumbled
through the summer, countered the Concord High School students
with humor.
</P>
<P>
"Thanks for the question, you little jerk," McCain joked back to
one student who asked the 71-year-old about his age. "You're
drafted."
</P>
<P>
McCain's two-day trip to New Hampshire launches his fall campaign
for the Republican nomination. During a morning visit with
students, he explained why he was not shrinking from his support
for a temporary increase of troops in Iraq and why students
should pay attention.
</P>
<P>
"If this war continues much longer, there will be people in this
audience who will serve in the military, who also may be going
over there (in Iraq) or to Afghanistan," McCain told the high
school students.
</P>
<P>
He said the students should watch the upcoming report on Iraq
from Gen. David Petraeus.
</P>
<P>
"It may be a seminal debate. It may be one of the most important
debates in history and it may directly affect your lives," he
warned. "He's going to say: Whether it was or was not in the
beginning, if we lose Iraq, it will be part of this struggle
against radical, Islamic extremism because al-Qaida will take
over and the area will deteriorate into chaos and destruction."
</P>
<P>
But during a town hall-style meeting, students were more
interested in pushing McCain on the environment, his support for
gay rights and even his age.
</P>
<P>
"If elected, you'd be older than Ronald Reagan, making you the
oldest president. Do you ever worry you might die in office or
get Alzheimer's or some other disease that might affect your
judgment?" one student asked.
</P>
<P>
The audience groaned; McCain slid into a joke.
</P>
<P>
"I think it was one of my sons that alleged I'm getting to the
point I hide my own Easter eggs," McCain said to laughter. "When
you saw my 95-year-old mother (on a video introduction), you saw
the kind of genes I have."
</P>
<P>
He said he is a hard campaigner and his age will not be an issue.
</P>
<P>
Another student pushed him on gay rights; McCain repeated his
pledge to oppose discrimination but support for traditional
marriage.
</P>
<P>
"I came here looking to see a good leader," 16-year-old William
Sleaster told McCain to boos. "I don't."
