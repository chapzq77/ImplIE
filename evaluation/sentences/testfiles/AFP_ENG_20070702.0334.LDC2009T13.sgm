<P>
Athens International Airport on Monday reported a 10.1-percent
traffic increase in the first six months of 2007 to 7.4 million
passengers and announced plans to triple its present capacity.
</P>
<P>
"Air traffic in Europe is expected to double by 2020," Athens
International Airport CEO Yiannis Paraschis told a news
conference.
</P>
<P>
"If we want to maintain the level of service we have today, much
needs to be done on the capacity of both skies and airports," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The airport will spend some 100 million euros (135 million
dollars) over the next three years to shift around 30 percent of
traffic to its satellite terminal and expand its main terminal to
create new commerce and lounge areas.
</P>
<P>
A new 50,000-square-metre exhibition centre will also be
inaugurated on-site by 2009, Paraschis said.
</P>
<P>
AIA's present zoning plan foresees a capacity of 21 million
passengers but the airport ultimately plans to expand to 50
million, he added.
</P>
<P>
Between January and June, arrivals from Britain increased by 38
percent to over 94,000, followed by travellers from the US (a 22
percent increase to over 186,000) and France (an 18 percent
increase to over 80,000).
</P>
<P>
Greek national carrier Olympic Airlines is the airport's premier
user with 34 percent of resources, followed by Greek private
carrier Aegean Airlines (25 percent) and Germany's Lufthansa
(three percent).
</P>
<P>
Athens International Airport SA was established in June 1996
under a partnership between the Greek state and a private
consortium led by the German company Hochtief Aktiengesellshaft.
</P>
<P>
The consortium won a tender to build and operate the airport for
30 years.
</P>
<P>
The Greek state holds a 55-percent stake in the company, with
private investors holding the remaining 45 percent.
