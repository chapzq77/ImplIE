Green group slams Eiffel Tower 'snow trek'

<P>
French environmentalists on Thursday slammed a decision to coat
part of the Eiffel Tower with artificial snow for the festive
season, saying it was a costly waste of water.
</P>
<P>
The first of the iron tower's three floors, 57 metres (125 feet)
above ground, has been clad in 20 to 30 centimetres (eight to 12
inches) of snow, with free rackets on hand for tourists to trek
across the Paris monument.
</P>
<P>
But the association Robin des Bois (Robin Hood) attacked the
operation, part of a photo exhibition on the North and South
Poles running until December 31, saying it would waste
"thousands" of cubic metres of water.
</P>
<P>
It accused the Eiffel Tower of "exploiting global warming" for
commercial gain, saying there were "more appropriate places in
Paris to hold an exhibition on the polar caps."
</P>
<P>
The tower's managing company rejected the charge, saying the
Christmas operation would use no more than 60 cubic metres of
water.
</P>
<P>
With some 6.7 million visitors last year, the Eiffel Tower is one
of the world's most visited landmarks.
