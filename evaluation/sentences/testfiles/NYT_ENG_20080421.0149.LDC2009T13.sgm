POLITICIANS AS COMICS: A SIDESHOW ON POP TV
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Somewhere in between the parade of busty women in low-cut gold
lame minidresses and contestants spinning the wheel, George Bush
made a star turn.
</P>
<P>
"I'm thrilled to be on 'Deal or No Deal' with you tonight," Bush
said from a giant screen in a cameo taped for the Monday episode
of one of NBC's most popular prime-time shows. The president
paused a beat. "Come to think of it, I'm thrilled to be anywhere
with high ratings these days."
</P>
<P>
Elitism is to the 2008 campaign as communism was to 1950s
politics: a career breaker. And pop TV is the antidote, a free
platform to rub shoulders with viewers who only glancingly pay
attention to the news. Making nice on a cooking program or game
show is the macropopulist equivalent of knocking down pins in a
bowling alley in Altoona, Pa., or belting down Crown Royal
whiskey in a bar in Crown Point, Ind., only better: the setting,
be it Rachael Ray's kitchen or Howie Mandel's array of suitcases
on "Deal or No Deal," is as familiar as home to millions of
viewers. None of the presidential candidates want to be seen as
snooty or overeducated, which must be why on Monday all three
provided taped greetings to wrestling fans watching "WWE Raw" on
the USA network.
</P>
<P>
Even a president can do a stint on a lowbrow entertainment show
as long as it is cloaked in a dignified cause. The "Deal or No
Deal" contestant Bush rooted for, Joe Kobes, is a decorated Army
captain who served three tours in Iraq. Timing, however, matters.
While it may be the first time a sitting president found it
fitting to make fun of himself on a game show, that showstopper
came at a moment when the Bush presidency is in eclipse.
</P>
<P>
The first lady, Laura Bush, is scheduled to serve as an NBC co-
host on "Today" on Tuesday, but she was outflanked by her would-
be Republican successor, Cindy McCain, who on Monday was a guest
co-host of "The View" on ABC and shared some secrets about her
husband. (Cindy McCain said that the man she calls "Johnny-Boy"
loves horticulture and cooking and contrary to news reports does
not have a "temper" problem.)
</P>
<P>
Michelle Obama, who last week stood up for her husband's common
touch on "The Colbert Report," tried to prove it by taping a
segment of "Rachael Ray" alongside Barack Obama on Monday. The
episode is expected to run in May.
</P>
<P>
Hillary Rodham Clinton performed a self-mocking skit on "The
Colbert Report" last week (not to be confused with her self-
mocking skit on "Saturday Night Live," on March 1) and agreed to
appear on "Larry King Live" on CNN on Monday night. Obama
accepted a seat, for the third time, on "The Daily Show With Jon
Stewart."
</P>
<P>
The novelty of politicians showing their lighter side on national
television has begun to weigh heavily on the campaign season. The
surprise lies not in who does which show, but who doesn't do them
at all, and at this point only the pope has held out.
</P>
<P>
It's hard to recall how unusual it was to see Gov. Bill Clinton
of Arkansas playing the sax on "The Arsenio Hall Show" in 1992 or
Bush revealing his favorite sandwich (peanut butter and jelly on
white bread) on "Oprah" during the 2000 campaign. Some
candidates, however, are bigger hams than others. McCain had a
walk-on part on the Fox drama "24" in 2006, and played himself as
a wedding guest in the 2005 film comedy "Wedding Crashers."
</P>
<P>
In politics as in show business too many appearances can weaken
their value: All three presidential candidates taped appeals for
donations for a special star-studded episode of "American Idol"
this month and all three were bumped by bigger stars (Reese
Witherspoon, Miley Cyrus) and relegated to the next night. The
law of diminishing returns works the other way as well. Satirical
programs like "The Daily Show" send up politicians, but they
increasingly invite politicians to send themselves up on their
dime; too much collusion blunts the satire and turns even the
most irreverent, iconoclastic television personalities into
insiders.
</P>
<P>
This campaign year, more than any other, highlights the pecking
order of television appearances -- the higher the politicians'
stature or rank, the less they have to clown; the farther behind
they are in the polls, the harder they have to sing for their
supper.
</P>
<P>
Last week Clinton, Obama and Sen. John Edwards all appeared on
the same episode of "The Colbert Report." Edwards, who dropped
out of the Democratic race in January, delivered a lengthy
monologue mocking himself as a standard-bearer for the white male
voter. Clinton was assigned a less embarrassing task: She
pretended to be the only person in the studio who could fix a
broken television screen. "Try toggling the input," she
instructed an unseen engineer. Obama, who is ahead of her in the
delegate count, didn't have to mug; he only had to appear live by
satellite from a campaign stop, and actually managed to work
parts of his stump speech into the cameo.
</P>
<P>
Less is more, and more clout means less time on the air. True
power is being able to turn down Ellen DeGeneres or Jon Stewart.
But in the perennial campaign no politician is strong enough to
just say no -- not even Nancy Reagan who in 1983 couldn't say no
to "Diff'rent Strokes."
