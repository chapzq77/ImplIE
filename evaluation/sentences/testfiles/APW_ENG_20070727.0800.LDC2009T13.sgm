Former heavyweight boxer James Oyebola died Friday, four days
after being shot in the head following a dispute about smoking at
a London bar, police said.

<P>
Doctors turned off life-support systems after determining that
Oyebola's brain was dead.

Oyebola, 47, a native of Nigeria, was a bronze medalist at the
1986 Commonwealth Games and won the World Boxing Council
international heavyweight title in 1993. He retired from the ring
in 1996.

Metropolitan Police said the 6-foot, 9-inch (206-centimeter-tall)
boxer apparently tried to intervene in a dispute between staff at
a west London bar and three customers, reportedly about enforcing
the recent ban on smoking in public places.

The argument, which occurred just after midnight Sunday, involved
three men and security over smoking in the covered courtyard at
the rear of the premises.

Witnesses said four shots were fired, and the suspects fled. No
arrests have been made.
