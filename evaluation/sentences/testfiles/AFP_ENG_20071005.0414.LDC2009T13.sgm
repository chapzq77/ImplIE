A grenade appeared to have been thrown at a building near the
Australian embassy in East Timor's capital, causing a "large"
explosion but no injuries, the UN police said Friday.

The Defence Cooperation Programme (DCP) building near the embassy
was targeted in the Thursday night attack, the police said in

"The explosion damaged windows of the DCP compound and is thought
to have been caused by a grenade. There were no reports of any
injuries, and forensic investigators are examining the crime
scene," the statement said.

Sporadic outbreaks of rock-throwing and other minor violence have
persisted in Dili and other hotspots throughout the half-island
nation in the wake of major unrest that erupted last April and
May, leaving at least 37 people dead.

Australia has a large contingent of peacekeepers and police
patrolling in East Timor. The forces were sent to restore calm in
the wake of the chaos last year.
