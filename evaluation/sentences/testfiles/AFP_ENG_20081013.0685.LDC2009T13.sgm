merit as he dominated the end-of-season awards here, organisers
said.

Liao, who finished 17th at the Omega Championship on Sunday after
suffering neck pain, was also named most improved player and
finished with the best stroke average.

The 31-year-old succeeds Li Chao, the two-time merit winner, and
Zhang Lianwei, who won the title in 2006.

"Winning the Omega Order of Merit proves I have the ability. I
had a great career as an amateur but it took me five years to
finally win as a pro," said Liao.
