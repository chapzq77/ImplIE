CLEM MCSPADDEN, 82, VOICE OF PRO RODEO
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Clem McSpadden, known as the voice of professional rodeo, his
Oklahoma intonations a familiar presence through six decades as
the sport grew from a rural pastime to a spectacle showcased in
Las Vegas, died July 7 in Houston. McSpadden, also a former U.S.
congressman and an Oklahoma state legislator, was 82.
</P>
<P>
His death, at the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, was announced by
the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association. McSpadden, who lived
in Chelsea, Okla., was a past president of the association.
</P>
<P>
McSpadden was a grand-nephew of the humorist Will Rogers and grew
up on a ranch in Oologah, Okla., that was owned by Rogers and
managed by McSpadden's father, Herb.
</P>
<P>
McSpadden displayed a dry wit in his own right when comparing his
dual callings of rodeo and politics. Last January, when the post
office in Chelsea, Okla., was renamed in his honor, McSpadden was
quoted by The Tulsa World as observing how "there's an amazing
correlation between the two arenas in that there's bull in each
profession."
</P>
<P>
McSpadden was competing as a professional rodeo performer while a
student at Oklahoma A&amp;amp;M (now Oklahoma State) when he
filled in as an announcer at an Iowa rodeo in 1947. He earned
$100 for four nights of announcing and $286 for winning the calf
roping.
</P>
<P>
He went on to become general manager of the National Finals Rodeo
in Oklahoma City for almost two decades before it left for Las
Vegas in the mid-1980s. He announced rodeos in 41 states and was
the first American to be the voice of Canada's prominent Calgary
Stampede. He was a rodeo announcer for A "Wide World of Sports"
in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
"There are very few people who you can say really made rodeo, and
he is one of them," Shawn Davis, general manager of the National
Finals Rodeo, told the cowboys association.
</P>
<P>
Early in his announcing career, McSpadden turned to politics. A
Democrat, he was an Oklahoma state senator from 1955 to 1972,
served one term in Congress, then gave up his seat to seek his
party's gubernatorial nomination in 1974. He was beaten in a
runoff primary by David Boren, who won the general election.
</P>
<P>
McSpadden operated a ranch near Chelsea, and he owned a lobbying
firm in Oklahoma City. He is survived by his wife, Donna; his
sons Bart and Paul; a daughter, Kay Lucas; and six grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
When McSpadden opened rodeos, he presided over a quiet moment,
reciting the cowboy's prayer he had written. It became a
signature of his persona. It concludes:
</P>
<P>
"Help us, Lord, to live our lives in such a manner that when we
make that last inevitable ride to the country up there, where the
grass grows lush, green and stirrup high, and the water runs
cool, clear and deep, that you, as our last Judge, will tell us
that our entry fees are paid."
