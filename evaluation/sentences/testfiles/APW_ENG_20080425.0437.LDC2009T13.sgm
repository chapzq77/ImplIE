Mothers from polygamous sect separated from young children after
Texas court OKs foster homes

ELDORADO, Texas 2008-04-25 08:32:58 UTC

Mothers from a polygamous sect in the United States described an
emotional, rushed scene when they were forced from the shelter
where they had been staying with their young children since the
state removed them from their homes.
</P>
<P>
"My two oldest were just terrified and they clung to me saying,
`Mother, mother, we want to go with you,'" said Ruth, her voice
breaking as she began to cry. She and other members of the
Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints who
spoke outside the sect's ranch Thursday declined to give their
last names, fearing it will affect their custody cases.
</P>
<P>
Dozens of mothers were bused away from their children at the San
Angelo Coliseum on Thursday after their legal efforts to stay
united were rejected. Texas officials were preparing to move the
last of the more than 400 children taken from the sect's ranch to
group homes, shelters and residences, some hundreds of miles
(kilometers) away, over the next few days.
</P>
<P>
One woman held a handwritten sign out the bus window that read:
"SOS. Mothers separated. Help."
</P>
<P>
"There are no words to describe how it was," said Velvet, a
mother who was forced to leave her 13-month-old. "We've been
staying up nights to watch over the children because we didn't
know what would happen."
</P>
<P>
In Salt Lake City, Utah, about 100 protesters gathered outside
EnergySolutions Arena on Thursday night to support the FLDS
parents who have been fighting accusations of abuse within the
sect since their ranch was raided April 3.
</P>
<P>
The protesters held signs that read "Free the Children" and "Got
Constitution?" and chanted "Shame on Texas; free those kids!" as
fans walked by on their way to the NBA playoff game between the
Houston Rockets and the Utah Jazz.
</P>
<P>
"My heart's breaking for those kids," said Kathleen Tucker, 58,
who attended with her daughter and four grandchildren. Tucker
said she was not affiliated with the FLDS church, but felt the
families' religious freedoms were violated.
</P>
<P>
"How in the world can they do that? How can the state do that?"
she asked.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Texas' 3rd Court of Appeals rejected the
mothers' pleas to immediately stop authorities from busing the
children taken from the ranch to foster homes.
</P>
<P>
The Austin-based court agreed to hear arguments Tuesday, but
attorney Robert Doggett, who represents 48 mothers, said that
"having a hearing after the fact" was pointless.
</P>
<P>
"It could very well be there's some good reasons to remove some
of those children, absolutely," Doggett said. "But to suggest all
of them be painted with this broad brush because they belong to a
particular religion is a very dangerous thing, and that's why we
have courts."
</P>
<P>
The Yearning For Zion Ranch in Eldorado, south of San Angelo, is
owned by the FLDS, a renegade Mormon sect.
</P>
<P>
Texas officials allege that the sect encourages adolescent girls
to marry older men and have children, and that boys are groomed
to become future perpetrators. Sect members deny the allegations.
</P>
<P>
"That's all it is, an allegation," FLDS leader Willie Jessop said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Child welfare officials removed the children on suspicion of
physical and sexual abuse after a family violence center received
calls from a female saying she was a 16-year-old girl inside the
compound whose 49-year-old husband beat and raped her. A judge
awarded the state temporary custody last week after signing an
emergency order nearly three weeks ago authorizing the state to
remove the children from their homes.
</P>
<P>
The case has been marked by confusion, even on the number of
children involved. The state's count rose, for the second time,
to 462 on Thursday because officials believe 25 more mothers from
the compound who had claimed to be adults are under 18.
</P>
<P>
About 260 children remain in the coliseum. Child Protective
Services officials say they will move them as soon as possible,
but no timeline has been set.
</P>
<P>
Authorities are investigating whether the call that prompted the
raid came from a woman in Colorado who has a history of making
fake calls to authorities. The purported 16-year-old caller has
not been identified, but state child welfare officials say their
investigation has uncovered evidence of abuse and that they
responded to the call in good faith.
</P>
<P>
"It's really what we found that mattered," Child Protective
Services spokesman Darrell Azar said.
</P>
<P>
Last week, state officials separated mothers from their children
unless the kids were 5 or younger, an exception that meant many
of the mothers were able to stay until Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"There were tears by the children, by the women and by some of
our caseworkers," Azar said.
</P>
<P>
The youngsters will be held in foster group homes around the
state until individual custody decisions can be made. Each mother
will get individual hearings by June 5, state District Judge
Barbara Walther has said.
</P>
<P>
The church's leader, Warren Jeffs, was convicted in September in
southern Utah for his role in arranging the marriage of a 14
-year-old girl to an older cousin. A judge on Thursday rejected
Jeffs' request for a new trial.
