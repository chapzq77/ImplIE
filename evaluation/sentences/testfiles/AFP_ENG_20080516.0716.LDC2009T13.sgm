US urges SKorea quickly to open beef market
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
US Commerce Secretary Carlos Gutierrez urged South Korea Friday
quickly to open its market to American beef, and dismissed fears
of mad cow disease which have brought thousands of protesters
onto the streets.
</P>
<P>
"There is no safer beef. It is second to none in the world," he
said during a visit to Seoul aimed at pushing forward with a
sweeping free trade agreement (FTA) between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The FTA was signed last June but must be ratified by the
legislatures of both countries. Opposition parties here say they
will not approve it unless a separate agreement opening the
Korean market to US beef is renegotiated.
</P>
<P>
The two sides signed the beef deal last month. But the parties
and street protesters say the meat carries a risk of the human
form of mad cow disease.
</P>
<P>
Seoul's agriculture ministry this week delayed resumption of beef
imports by a week to 10 days to consider protest petitions, but
says there will be no renegotiation.
</P>
<P>
"We look forward to the full and quick implementation of this
(beef) agreement," Gutierrez told a press conference, describing
the delay as unfortunate.
</P>
<P>
"The beef which we will be selling to Korea is the same beef that
we all buy in the US, that we feed our children in the US and is
the same beef that Korean- Americans eat in the US," the commerce
secretary said.
</P>
<P>
South Korea also says the beef is totally safe. But President Lee
Myung-Bak has said his government should have done more to
counter mad cow fears, which are fuelled by Internet postings or
anonymous text messaging.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting with Gutierrez Friday Lee asked for US help to get
the message across to Koreans. "I hope (the US government) can
extend a lot of support to help appease the people," he told him.
</P>
<P>
Gutierrez said he and Lee agreed that "facts and science" should
be considered during the beef debate.
</P>
<P>
He reaffirmed President George W. Bush's commitment to have
Congress approve the FTA this year and said he expects it to be
approved once it comes to a vote.
</P>
<P>
The FTA "would create jobs in Korea and the US, strengthen and
build prosperity in Korea and the US and give consumers greater
choice in Korea and the US," Gutierrez said.
</P>
<P>
For South Korea's economy to reach the next level of advancement,
"it will take the kind of reforms and openness the KORUS FTA will
bring."
</P>
<P>
For the US, the commerce secretary said, lowering barriers to
trade was more important than ever. Trade was the second largest
contributor to America's GDP in 2007 and exports in the first
quarter kept the economy growing.
</P>
<P>
"We must make it clear to those who would support economic
isolationism in America -- or in any country -- that a step away
from the global economy would have devastating consequences."
</P>
<P>
Total trade between South Korea and the US is worth an annual 80
billion dollars. Some studies show this could eventually rise by
up to 20 billion dollars under a free trade regime.
