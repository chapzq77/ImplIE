A weak tropical storm formed Saturday off the Yucatan Peninsula
and quickly made landfall at the Belize-Mexico border, dumping
rain and kicking up surf.
</P>
<P>
The first named storm of the 2008 Atlantic Hurricane Season,
Arthur was moving northwest across the Yucatan with maximum
sustained winds near 40 mph (64 kph), according to the National
Hurricane Center in Miami. It formed one day before the official
start of the season June 1.
</P>
<P>
The storm hit land near the Mexican port city of Chetumal and
Belize's Corozal city, dumping rain as far south as Belize City
and kicking up strong surf on the popular tourist island of
Ambergis Caye.
</P>
<P>
Tropical storm warnings were issued for Belize and Mexico's
Caribbean coastline.
</P>
<P>
In the Mexican state of Quintana Roo, which includes the popular
resort of Cancun, ports were closed and all water sports were
banned. Residents and tourists were encouraged to take
precautions in coastal areas, said state Civil Protection
Director Carlos Rodriguez Hoy.
</P>
<P>
Ports were also closed on the islands of Cozumel and Isla Mujeres
and in Chetumal.
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez said authorities expected rains of up to a little more
than 1 inch (30 millimeters) due to the passing remnants of
Arthur.
</P>
<P>
In northern Belize, the National Emergency Management
Organization expected about 4 inches (102 millimeters) of rain
and warned of possible flooding around the Azul Hondo River.
</P>
<P>
Rain and rough seas ruined vacations for tourists in Ambergis
Caye.
</P>
<P>
"I just came to lay in the sun and get a nice tan, but so far
there hasn't been any sunshine," said Debbie Fountaineau, a
police officer from Lake Charles, Louisiana, who arrived on the
island Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The storm was projected to weaken as it crosses the Yucatan
before moving out into the Gulf of Mexico as a tropical
depression early Sunday.
</P>
<P>
There was chance it could strengthen back into a tropical storm
before hitting Mexico again south of Veracruz on Wednesday, said
Jamie Rhome, a meteorologist with the Hurricane Center. It was
not expected to become a hurricane.
</P>
<P>
At 2:00 p.m. EDT (1800 GMT) the storm's center was located about
50 miles (80 kilometers) northwest of Belize City.
</P>
<P>
The storm was expected to stay well away from the U.S. Gulf
Coast. "This is not a danger to the United States," said Rhome.
