New Jersey bans Iran investments, becomes one of few US states to
do so

<P>
New Jersey on Friday became one of at least three U.S. states to
prohibit state pension money from being invested in companies
doing business in Iran.
</P>
<P>
Most American companies are already barred from doing business in
the country, but Democratic Gov. Jon S. Corzine signed a measure
restricting the state from buying stock in international
companies that do business with Iran.
</P>
<P>
The move is designed to protest the country's links to terrorism
and its nuclear ambitions.
</P>
<P>
"I continue to support using economic means, not military means,
to bring about policy changes in Iran," Corzine said recently
when discussing the bill signed privately on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Florida and California have similar laws.
</P>
<P>
Florida's law also banned investments in Sudan, and the board
governing Florida's public employee retirement fund authorized it
to divest nearly $1.3 billion (euro880,000 million) invested with
21 companies doing business in the two nations.
</P>
<P>
California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger in October signed
legislation to end state investment in companies that do business
with Iran.
</P>
<P>
New Jersey Assemblyman Neil Cohen, a Democrat who helped sponsor
the bill, cited Iranian threats against Israel.
</P>
<P>
"Divesting our finances from entities associated with Iran will
send a clear message in the universal language of money that New
Jersey will have no part in Iran's pursuit of actions that would
lead to Holocaust-like genocide and the complete destruction of a
sovereign nation," Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
The New Jersey proposal mirrors a 2005 bill that prohibited
investing state pension funds in companies doing business in
Sudan to protest what the United States has deemed a genocide in
the African nation.
</P>
<P>
New Jersey also passed a similar law in the 1980s barring
investments in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
The state's pension fund is worth about $80 billion (euro54
billion), though it was unclear how much is invested in companies
doing business in Iran. The law requires the state to hire an
independent research firm specializing in global securities to
identify such investments.
</P>
<P>
New Jersey's pension fund is the nation's ninth largest. It
recently divested $2.16 billion (euro1.47 billion) from 17
companies doing business in Sudan.
