US raid into Syria a new tack in terror war

WASHINGTON 2008-10-27 14:20:43 UTC

<P>
The startling U.S. commando attack inside Syrian territory over
the weekend appears to amplify an emerging message to countries
giving safe passage to terrorists: Take action, or else the U.S.
will.
</P>
<P>
A U.S. military official in Washington says special forces
conducted the raid in Syria on Sunday to target the network of
al-Qaida-linked foreign fighters moving through Syria to help
fight in the war in Iraq. Syria said troops in four helicopters
attacked a building and killed eight people, including four
children.
</P>
<P>
"We are taking matters into our own hands," the U.S. military
official in Washington told The Associated Press, speaking on
condition of anonymity due to the political sensitivity of cross-
border raids.
</P>
<P>
Though the flow of foreign fighters from Syria to Iraq has been
declining, Americans have been unable to shut down the network in
the area struck because Syria was out of the military's reach.
</P>
<P>
The move appears to echo one taken recently in America's other
current war. President George W. Bush in July secretly approved
U.S. military raids inside anti-terror ally Pakistan, which has
been unwilling or unable to stem the flow of militants hiding in
Pakistan and waging cross-border raids into Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Helicopter-borne U.S. special forces conducted a raid Sept. 3
inside Pakistan -- the only one known so far following Bush's
order. Islamabad has complained bitterly about the move, which it
says killed some two dozen people, including civilians.
</P>
<P>
The U.S has become frustrated with the use of Pakistan's
northwestern tribal areas as a safe haven for militants nearly
seven years since the Taliban was rousted from Afghanistan for
harboring Osama bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
Defense Department spokesman Bryan Whitman refused to comment
Monday on Sunday's attack. And other military officials declined
to even mention it off the record because of the extreme
sensitivity.
</P>
<P>
But the raid came just days after the commander of U.S. forces in
western Iraq said American troops were redoubling efforts to
secure the Syrian border, which he called an "uncontrolled"
gateway for fighters entering Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Syria called the raid a "serious aggression," and its foreign
ministry summoned the charges d'affaires of the United States and
Iraq in protest.
</P>
<P>
Government newspapers also published scathing criticisms of the
raid in Monday's editions. Tishrin splashed its front pages with
a headline denouncing it as a "U.S. war crime," while Al-Baath
newspaper described the attack in an editorial as a "stunning,
shocking and unprecedented adventure."
</P>
<P>
The area targeted Sunday is near the Iraqi border city of Qaim,
which officials have said has been a major crossing point for
fighters, weapons and money coming into Iraq to fuel the Sunni
insurgency.
