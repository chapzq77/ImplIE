Indians fret over sale of iconic foods to Norwegians by Anil

One of southern India's biggest brands, MTR Foods, is being
swallowed up by a foreign owner to the dismay of local consumers,
who fear for their famed ready- to-eat vegetarian meals, pickles
and poppadums.
</P>
<P>
Sadanand Maiya, the founder of MTR Foods, and his associates last
week agreed to sell their combined 59 percent stake in the
Bangalore-based company to Norwegian consumer products maker
Orkla, which also bought out other, minority, shareholders.
</P>
<P>
MTR Foods is an offshoot of Mavalli Tiffin Rooms, a restaurant on
Bangalore's Lalbagh road founded in 1924 by Maiya's family to
serve vegetarian south Indian Brahmin cuisine.
</P>
<P>
The spartan two-storey restaurant is a tourist attraction and an
institution in Bangalore, India's Silicon Valley, where patrons
wait patiently for hours for their turn to eat its wholesome
multi-course vegetarian meals.
</P>
<P>
"Every Bangalorean is proud of MTR," said R. C. Purohit,
president of the Federation of Karnataka Chambers of Commerce and
Industry. "We take every visiting relative and friend there for a
meal, despite the queue."
</P>
<P>
MTR Foods has "created value that's commendable," Purohit said.
</P>
<P>
The restaurant is not part of the Maiya group's sale, which was
confirmed by Orkla on its website, www.orkla.com.
</P>
<P>
The February 13 sale is still pending Indian regulatory approval,
but consumers are already pining and wondering whether MTR's
packaged foods will taste the same again.
</P>
<P>
"Sob Sob," a reader who identified herself as Mytri commented on
the blogsite Metroblogging Bangalore. "I hope they continue all
the products and the quality."
</P>
<P>
"Will Orkla continue the success of MTR?" asked Naren, another
reader. "Will Orkla succeed in providing quality taste?"
</P>
<P>
A third consumer fondly recalled that MTR's heat-and-eat
vegetarian Indian meals had proved to be a godsend during
frequent travels in the Far East.
</P>
<P>
And an Indian contributor from Oslo, wondered whether he would
now be able to buy MTR's ready-to-eat bisibele baath, a popular
rice-lentil-vegetable preparation, in the Norwegian capital.
</P>
<P>
Orkla paid the equivalent of between 80 million and 100 million
dollars to buy the Indian company, according to local media, as
it enters the Asian market for the first time.
</P>
<P>
"As a result of this acquisition we will be able to assess the
Indian market as a possible future growth platform for Orkla's
branded consumer goods business at close quarters," Executive
Vice President Torkild Nordberg said in a statement on Orkla's
website.
</P>
<P>
Maiya was not available for comment. An MTR spokesman said
Thursday the company had sworn to remain silent for some time
following the transaction, adding Maiya might comment on the
transaction after about two weeks.
</P>
<P>
MTR Foods was born in the 1970s, when the government imposed food
price controls specifying what restaurants should charge for what
they served.
</P>
<P>
Mavalli Tiffin Rooms closed shop temporarily, saying it could not
maintain its quality if it served patrons at those prices, and
refusing to compromise.
</P>
<P>
Maiya, an electrical engineer, then launched MTR Foods, using the
restaurant's former employees. The company's first success was a
packaged mix for a breakfast pancake called the rava idli and it
graduated rapidly to other vegetarian snack foods and chips,
spices, pre-cooked meals and ice creams.
</P>
<P>
Helping its rise was the restaurant's reputation for quality and
hygiene, although MTR Foods remained a separate entity from
Mavalli Tiffin Rooms.
</P>
<P>
The agreement to sell MTR Foods follows the sale last year of
supermarket chain Niligiri's, another Bangalorean institution, to
a private equity investor. Customers still berate the founders,
the Mudaliar family, for selling out, a member of the family said
in published remarks.
</P>
<P>
Other Indian brands have also been sold.
</P>
<P>
In the 1990s, in the early days of Indian economic
liberalisation, tycoon Ramesh Chauhan sold his Thums Up and Limca
brands of soft drink to Coca-Cola.
</P>
<P>
Critics cried "sellout" and saw the sale as a sign that Indian
brands were set for an early demise, although both Thums Up and
Limca are still sold and boast sizeable customer loyalty.
</P>
<P>
This time, barring the emotional twinge felt by long-time
consumers, there has been no criticism so far, only acceptance --
perhaps a reflection of how far India has come along the road of
market reform.
</P>
<P>
Indian companies are increasingly venturing overseas for high-
profile acquisitions, with the Tata Group buying Anglo-Dutch
steelmaker Corus and Hindalco purchasing US aluminium maker
Novelis this year.
</P>
<P>
"There will be acquisitions everywhere," said Purohit of the
Federation of Karnataka Chambers of Commerce and Industry.
"Globalisation cannot be one- sided."
