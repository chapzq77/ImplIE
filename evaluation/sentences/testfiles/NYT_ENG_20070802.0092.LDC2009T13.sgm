SUNDAY, AUG. 5

WASHINGTON - Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich said Thursday the
Bush administration is waging a "phony war" on terrorism, warning
that the country is losing ground against the kind of Islamic
radicals who attacked the country on Sept. 11, 2001.
</P>
<P>
A more effective approach, said Gingrich, would begin with a
national energy strategy aimed at weening the country from its
reliance on imported oil and some of the regimes that
petrodollars support.
</P>
<P>
"None of you should believe we are winning this war. There is no
evidence that we are winning this war," the Georgia Republican
told a group of about 300 students attending a conference for
collegiate conservatives.
</P>
<P>
Gingrich, who led the so-called Republican Revolution that won
the GOP control of both houses of Congress in 1994 midterm
elections, said more must be done to marshal national resources
to combat Islamic militants at home and abroad and to prepare the
country for future attack. He was unstinting in his criticism of
his fellow Republicans, in the White House and on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
"We were in charge for six years," he said, referring to the
period between 2001 and early 2007, when the GOP controlled the
White House and both houses of Congress. "I don't think you can
look and say that was a great success."
</P>
<P>
Said Gingrich, "Look at New Orleans, how can you say New Orleans
is succeeding? Look at Baghdad. If you can't look failure in the
face how do you improve it?"
</P>
<P>
Thursday's National Conservative Student Conference was sponsored
by the Young America's Foundation, a Herndon, Va.-based group
founded in the 1960s as a political counterpoint to the left-
leaning activists that coalesced around the civil rights movement
and opposition to the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
Gingrich retains strong support among conservatives and ranked
fifth among possible Republican nominees, behind former
Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, with the backing of 7 percent of
those queried in a ABC News/Washington Post poll taken last week.
The poll surveyed 403 Republicans and Republican-leaning adults
nationwide and has a 5 percentage-point margin of error.
</P>
<P>
"I believe we need to find leaders who are prepared to tell the
truth ././. about the failures of the performance of Republicans
././. failed bureaucracies ././. about how dangerous the world
is," he said when asked what kind of Republican he would back for
president.
</P>
<P>
While keeping an arm's length from overt presidential
politicking, Gingrich has been promoting a weekly political
newsletter he calls "Winning the Future." It's available free to
those who will leave their e-mail address at
http://www.winningthefuture.net, one of several Web sites he's
connected with or operating. Gingrich began writing the
newsletter in April, 2006, and it now goes out to 311,000 readers
each week, said Gingrich spokesman Rick Tyler.
</P>
<P>
At another Web site - www.americansolutions.com - Gingrich is
running a virtual political salon, with video clips,
organizational information and contacts revolving around his
conservative vision for the country's future. At that site,
Gingrich asks supporters to join in an Internet "Solutions Day"
on Sept. 27, the anniversary of his so-called "Contract With
America," a slate of conservative policies he led through
Congress as Speaker of the House a decade and a half ago.
</P>
<P>
"What I'm trying to start is a new dialogue that is evidence-
based," Gingrich said Thursday. "It doesn't start from the right
wing, it doesn't start from the left wing," he said, but is an
effort to get politicians and voters to "look honestly at the
evidence of what isn't working and tell us how to change it."
</P>
<P>
Gingrich was interrupted with applause once, when he called for
an end to the biting partisanship critics claim has polarized
national politics and paralyzed the workings of government.
</P>
<P>
"We have got to get past this partisan baloney, where I'm not
allowed to say anything good about Hillary Clinton because 'I'm
not a loyal Republican,' and she's not allowed to say anything
good about me, or she's not a 'loyal' Democrat. What a stupid way
to run a country."
</P>
<P>
He reserved his most pointed criticism, though, for the
administration's handling of the global campaign against
terrorist groups.
</P>
<P>
"We've been engaged in a phony war," said Gingrich. "The only
people who have been taking this seriously are the combat
military."
</P>
<P>
His remarks seemed to reflect, in part, the findings of a
National Intelligence Estimate made public last month. In the
estimate, the U.S. intelligence community concluded that six
years of U.S. efforts to degrade the al-Qaida terrorist group had
left the organization constrained but still potent, having
"protected or regenerated" the capability to attack the United
States in ways that have left the country "in a heightened threat
environment."
</P>
<P>
"We have to take this seriously," said Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
"We used to be a serious country. When we got attacked at Pearl
Harbor, we took on Imperial Japan, Fascist Italy and Nazi
Germany," he said, referring to World War II. "We beat all three
in less than four years. We're about to enter the seventh year of
this phony war against ././. (terrorist groups) and we're
losing."
</P>
<P>
Gingrich said he would lay out in a Sept. 10 speech what a
successful U.S. approach to this threat would have looked like
over the past six years.
</P>
<P>
"First of all, we have to have a national energy strategy, which
basically says to the Saudis, 'We're not going to rely on you,"'
Gingrich said.
</P>
<P>
The United States imports about 14 million barrels of oil a day,
making up two-thirds of its total consumption. Saudi Arabia is
roughly tied with Venezuela as this country's largest source of
foreign oil. Each country supplies about 1.5 million barrels of
oil a day to the United States, or about 7 percent of the
country's total supply.
</P>
<P>
President Bush has called for reducing U.S. gasoline consumption
by 20 percent over the coming decade, in part by improving fuel
efficiency for cars and trucks. In addition, the administration
and Congress have spent or allocated $15 billion to develop new
energy technologies and he has called for legislation aimed at
increasing domestic oil production.
</P>
<P>
Next, he said, the United States should be doing everything it
can to support reform-oriented activists in Iran, where Gingrich
sees a crackdown on dissent as a sign of vulnerability.
</P>
<P>
The Bush administration is spending $75 million this year to help
support reformists in Iran - by transmitting radio and television
programs into the country, running cultural exchange programs and
other activities. The program has run up against push back from
some quarters for allegedly being too assertive, with critics
alleging that some of the beamed-in broadcasts have the ring of
propaganda and that by being overly involved in Iran's internal
politics the United States runs the risk of making Iranian
reformists appear to be pro-American in ways that are
counterproductive within Iran.
</P>
<P>
"This is a dictatorship in crisis," he said of Iran, which U.S.
military officials accuse of providing armor-piercing weapons
that have killed American forces in neighboring Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Citing Iran's heavy reliance on imports of gasoline and other
refined petroleum products, Gingrich said, "I would have a very
active plan to sabotage the refineries in Iran, and I'd say, 'You
want to send rockets to Iraq, fine, you'll have to carry them by
ox cart."
