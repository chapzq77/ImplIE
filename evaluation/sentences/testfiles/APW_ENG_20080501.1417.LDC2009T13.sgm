Apple Inc. said Thursday that new movies from a slate of major
studios will now be available for purchase over iTunes the same
day they're released on DVD.
</P>
<P>
The change will beef up the number of new titles available in the
iTunes online store and help the service compete better against
DVD retailers.
</P>
<P>
Until this week, many of the movies available for purchase over
iTunes were older releases.
</P>
<P>
Newer releases have been available for rental through iTunes, but
users typically have to wait 30 days after the DVD release to get
their hands on those films, and the titles disappear from their
libraries once they're finished watching.
</P>
<P>
Apple's announcement Thursday did not include any change to the
rental policies.
</P>
<P>
iTunes movies are only available in the United States.
</P>
<P>
The push by the Cupertino, California-based company to get people
to order movies over iTunes reflects its success with the store
and its desire to control more of the user's digital
entertainment experience. Key to that campaign are the Apple TV
set-top boxes, which Apple hopes will cement the company more in
consumers' living rooms by streaming videos and other content
from users' computers to their television sets.
</P>
<P>
Apple said the new releases available this week for purchase over
iTunes to coincide with their DVD release include "American
Gangster" and "The Diving Bell and the Butterfly." Other new
titles Apple has added to the store include "Juno,"
"Cloverfield," "I Am Legend," and "There Will Be Blood."
</P>
<P>
The participating major studios are 20th Century Fox, Paramount
Pictures, Sony Pictures Entertainment, The Walt Disney Studios,
Warner Bros. and Universal Studios Home Entertainment.
</P>
<P>
New releases cost $14.99 to buy. Older titles cost $9.99.
