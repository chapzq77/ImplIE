Japanese property developer Urban Corp. collapsed Wednesday with
debts of 2.4 billion dollars due to a slump in the housing
market, the biggest bankruptcy in Japan this year.

The company said it had filed with the Tokyo District Court for
protection from creditors following a slump in the nation's real
estate market.

"Our company gave up self-resuscitation and decided to rebuild
itself under the Civil Rehabilitation Law," a company statement
said.

Debts totalled 255.83 billion yen (2.4 billion dollars), making
it this year's biggest bankruptcy yet in Japan, ahead of another
troubled developer, Kei-r Co., which collapsed in April owing
167.7 billion yen.

The number of Japanese real estate firms going bankrupt has
increased since the US "subprime" mortgage crisis erupted last
year, triggering a global credit crunch and weighing on Japan's
economy.
