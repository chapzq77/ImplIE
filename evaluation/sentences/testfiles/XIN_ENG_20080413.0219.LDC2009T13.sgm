Shaolin monks on Western dancing steps

ZHENGZHOU, April 14 (Xinhua)
</P>
<P>
Relaxing Western music, huge wooden boxes and Shaolin monks: the
seemingly incompatible elements are being combined into a new
dancing performance set to debut in London next month.
</P>
<P>
"Sutra", the latest production by Flemish-Moroccan choreographer
Sidi Larbi Cherkaoui, will be on show in the Sadler's Wells
Theater from May 27 to 31. The ticket prices range from 10
British pounds (19.70 U.S. dollars) to 35 pounds, he told Xinhua
while directing a rehearsal at the Shaolin Temple, in central
China's Henan Province, on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Cherkaoui takes a completely unconventional method to interpret
the martial art by underlining its contemplative spirit,
beautiful movements and imitation of animals, rather than
violence.
</P>
<P>
In the creative pantomime, 17 Buddhist Shaolin monks will make
movements such as standing in the huge boxes that fall down one
by one like dominos. They also jump like frogs.
</P>
<P>
"I was inspired by the Shaolin understanding of movement, their
complete identification with the living beings around them, and
that remarkable ability to become the essence of a tiger, crane
or snake," Cherkaoui said. "I want to show my audience another
layer of kung-fu."
</P>
<P>
In "Sutra", the 17 Shaolin kung-fu experts will show poetic and
thought- provoking images of how human or animal life goes from
beginning to the end.
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to go back to the internal conceits of Chan Buddhism,
about the philosophy of emptiness and how energy goes through but
is never contained by the body," Cherkaoui added. "We want to
show all qualities of kung-fu: relaxation as well as tension."
</P>
<P>
Hisashi Itoh, the pantomime producer, who called the kung-fu
movement "the most beautiful over the past 15 decades", said they
approached martial arts from a different perspective because
there have been "too much entertainment for Shaolin".
</P>
<P>
"It should be something of our inner part, rather than just tense
movement," he said.
</P>
<P>
Shi Xiaodong, 10, the youngest in the show, said the performance
was just like playing a game.
</P>
<P>
"I don't understand what the pantomime intends to tell, but some
of the actions in the performance were part of my routine, such
as sitting in meditation."
</P>
<P>
The show, a joint work of Cherkaoui and famed British sculptor
Antony Gormley, who created a constructed environment for the
performers, would be part of the Chinese dance season to be held
in the theater in May and June.
</P>
<P>
Established about 1,500 years ago, the Shaolin Temple is famous
for combining martial arts with Buddhism and is a popular tourist
attraction.
</P>
<P>
An estimated three million foreigners have studied Shaolin kung-
fu in some 50 countries and regions.
