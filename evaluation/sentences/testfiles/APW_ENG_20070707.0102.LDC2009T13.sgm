Feds detail alleged dog-fighting operation at Vick house

SURRY, Virginia 2007-07-07 00:59:17 UTC

<P>
A property owned by Atlanta Falcons quarterback Michael Vick was
used as the "main staging area for housing and training the pit
bulls involved" in an illegal dog-fighting operation, according
to court documents.
</P>
<P>
The papers, filed by federal authorities Monday in U.S. District
Court in Richmond and obtained Friday by The Associated Press,
contain the address of the Vick property that has been the center
of the investigation. The three-time National Football League Pro
Bowl quarterback is not identified in the documents, which were
filed in attempt to condemn the property and force its
forfeiture.
</P>
<P>
Friday, federal agents again searched the property. They finished
their work at about 4:30 p.m. and declined to answer reporters'
questions as they left.
</P>
<P>
Staging or facilitating dog fighting is a felony in 48 of 50
states in the United States, including Virginia.
</P>
<P>
According to the documents, dog fights have been sponsored by
"Bad Newz Kennels" at the property since at least 2002. For the
events, participants and dogs traveled from South Carolina, North
Carolina, Maryland, New York, Texas and other states.
</P>
<P>
Fifty-four animals were recovered from the property during
searches in April, along with a "rape stand," used to hold dogs
in place for mating; an electric treadmill modified for dogs; and
a bloodied piece of carpeting, the documents said.
</P>
<P>
Fights would end when one dog died or with the surrender of the
losing dog, which was sometimes put to death by drowning,
strangulation, hanging, gun shot, electrocution or some other
method, according to the documents.
</P>
<P>
Vick has said he rarely visited the property. No criminal charges
have been filed.
</P>
<P>
Officials raided the property on April 25, and -- after an
informant suggested authorities could find as many as 30 dogs
buried on the property -- Surry County officials secured a search
warrant but never acted on it because prosecutor Gerald G.
Poindexter said he had concerns with the document.
</P>
<P>
On June 7, the day that warrant expired, federal officials
executed their own with the help of state police investigators.
</P>
<P>
Poindexter publicly questioned the federal government's interest
in the case. He suggested Vick's celebrity was the draw and
raised race as a possible motivation.
</P>
<P>
Poindexter and Vick are black, as is Sheriff Harold Brown.
</P>
<P>
Vick has said he had no idea the property may have been used in a
criminal enterprise and blamed family members for taking
advantage of his generosity. He also put the house up for sale
and reportedly sold it quickly, although there is no record that
the sale has been legally completed.
