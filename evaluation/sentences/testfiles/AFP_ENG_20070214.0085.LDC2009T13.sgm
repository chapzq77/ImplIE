Mystery over Sadr as Iraq awaits crackdown by Bill Ickes
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
US defence officials claimed Wednesday that their Iraqi nemesis
radical Shiite cleric Moqtada la-Sadr has fled for Iran ahead of
a planned military crackdown on sectarian violence.
</P>
<P>
The anti-American firebrand's supporters dismissed the
allegations by anonymous military officials, insisting that Sadr
supports the joint US-Iraq Baghdad security plan and that they
will disarm their militia once order is restored.
</P>
<P>
"We have seen the reports and believe them to be accurate," a US
defence official told AFP in Baghdad, referring to reports in the
US media that Sadr had been driven overland to Tehran two or
three weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
He has not been seen publicly in Iraq in that period, but Nassar
al-Rubaie, the head of Sadr's parliamentary bloc, insisted that
the cleric was "still inside Iraq and working normally" and had
no fear of US forces.
</P>
<P>
Bassem al-Aathari, an official at Sadr's office in Najaf south of
Baghdad, said the cleric is still in the Shiite holy city and
that if he were to travel abroad this would be announced as had
been the case for previous trips.
</P>
<P>
"It's ridiculous. It's nothing," Rubaie told AFP in Baghdad. "If
the US army already in Iraq is incapable of resisting Sadr, what
difference would 20,000 reinforcements make?"
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon describes Sadr's Mahdi Army militia as the most
dangerous single faction in the vicious sectarian war gripping
Iraq, accusing rogue elements of the force of killing hundreds of
Sunni civilians.
</P>
<P>
The United States is in the process of sending five extra combat
brigades to support a joint US-Iraqi operation to pacify Baghdad,
which is in the grip of a bloody war between Shiite and Sunni
factions.
</P>
<P>
Rubaie repeated the Sadr movement's insistence that it supports
the security plan and that its fighters would disarm once the
plan is successful.
</P>
<P>
"The arms that people got to defend themselves will disappear as
soon as the state assures security. We support this plan," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Iraq announced Tuesday it will close its borders with Iran and
Syria and impose draconian emergency-style security measures on
Baghdad, although the commander of the operation said the decree
would come into effect "later".
</P>
<P>
Lieutenant General Abboud Gambar, appeared on state television
clad in military fatigues and a red beret to warn: "All those who
breach the terms of this decree will be judged under the law on
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Four of the main Iranian and two Syrian border posts will remain
closed for 72 hours, before reopening, but others will be shut
indefinitely, he said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, weapons permits will be suspended for everyone in
Baghdad apart from the Iraqi and US-led security forces and
registered private security firms and the city's nightly curfew
will be reinforced.
</P>
<P>
Gambar will combine under his command police and military forces,
and be empowered to crack down on rogue security force units
within the capital.
</P>
<P>
The decree will authorise him to "impose necessary restrictions
in all public places and centres and clubs and organisations and
unions and businesses and institutions and offices to protect
citizens and people who work.
</P>
<P>
"Searches will be done on public streets and precautionary
measures will be applied on packages, mail, messages and
communications and telecommunications equipment," he said,
reading the decree on state television.
</P>
<P>
"Security forces will be authorised to block or search public or
private property ... (and) will have the right to impose travel
restrictions on individuals or vehicles," he added.
</P>
<P>
Iraqis living in housing belonging to displaced persons will be
given two weeks to leave or face eviction, he warned.
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks anonymous US military briefers have been pushing
claims that Tehran is directly involved in supplying weaponry to
Shiite factions in Iraq, including armour-piercing bombs that
have killed 170 US soldiers.
</P>
<P>
Iran denies the claims.
