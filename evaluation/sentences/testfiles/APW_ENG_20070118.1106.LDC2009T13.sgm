comments critical of Bush

Iraq's prime minister said security forces would have better
control over their country if the United States had equipped them
with more -- and better -- weapons, speaking during an interview
in which he was deeply critical of Washington, an Italian daily
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In comments on U.S. President George W. Bush's revised strategy
for the country, Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki also told Milan-
based Corriere della Sera that the situation in Iraq would not be
so dire if the Americans had moved faster .
</P>
<P>
"The situation would be much better if the United States had
immediately sent our security forces more adequate weapons and
equipment. If they had committed themselves more and with greater
speed we would have had a lot fewer deaths among Iraqi civilians
and American soldiers," al-Maliki was quoted as saying by
Corriere.
</P>
<P>
But in Baghdad, an Iraqi government spokesman, Ali al-Dabbagh,
denied that al-Maliki made the comments to Corriere. "The news
circulated by the media about the Iraqi prime minister's
declaration regarding relations with American administration are
baseless."
</P>
<P>
The newspaper stood by its reporting Thursday. Paolo Lepri,
Corriere's foreign editor, said the interview had been taped.
</P>
<P>
According to Corriere, the Iraqi leader stopped short of openly
criticizing Bush's plan to send 21,500 more American troops to
join the estimated 130,000 already in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"We have to see how the situation in the field will go," he told
the newspaper. "We cannot rule out that the situation will
drastically improve, allowing U.S. troops to leave the country in
great numbers in three to six months."
</P>
<P>
Al-Maliki was deeply critical of the Bush administration during
the interview, and Corriere quoted the Iraqi leader as saying
Bush had capitulated to domestic pressure when he criticized the
hanging of former leader Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
"It seems to me that Bush is capitulating under the weight of
internal pressure; he is overwhelmed by the media and by the
politicians. Maybe he has lost control of the situation," he
said.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Bush said Saddam's execution looked like "kind of a
revenge killing" and said it showed that al-Maliki's government
"has still got some maturation to do."
</P>
<P>
Al-Maliki reiterated that Saddam's trial and execution had been
carried out according to Iraqi law and Islamic rules, and "had
nothing to do with sectarian vendettas." Still, he acknowledged
that mistakes had been made during Saddam's hanging, and said he
had ordered those who shouted slogans against the former
president to stand trial.
</P>
<P>
The Dec. 30 hanging of Saddam raised widespread criticism when
video showed his executioners taunting him on the gallows and
shouting Shiite slogans. The gruesome decapitation of Saddam's
half brother during his execution Monday prompted more
international condemnation.
</P>
<P>
Barzan Ibrahim plunged through the trap door and was beheaded by
the jerk of the thick rope at the end of his fall; the Iraqi
government said the decapitation was an accident.
