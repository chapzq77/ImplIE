KICKERS EMBRACE THEIR INNER LINEBACKER
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

As a high school senior, Jeff Feagles was encouraged by his
football coach to play free safety. Feagles stood 6 feet 1 inch
and weighed about 200 pounds, the perfect size for the last line
of defense.

"I was supposed to make a lot of tackles," he said. "I hated it.
I was always getting the wind knocked out of me. That stuck with
me: I am not going to do this."
</P>
<P>
So he doesn't.
</P>
<P>
Feagles, the Giants' punter who is in his 21st NFL season, has
made only 11 tackles in the past 15 years. It makes him among the
active players most desperate to avoid contact.
</P>
<P>
Kickers and punters have long been snidely considered something
less than football players, and Feagles actually embraces the
life apart. He considers himself a specialist. But he may soon be
obsolete: The most recent generation of kickers and punters seem
to have made a philosophical choice to reject their reputation
and dive into the pile.

Jay Feely of the Jets, regarded by his peers as the most
aggressive and perhaps craziest tackler among today's kickers,
recently notched one against San Francisco. It was his fourth of
the season and the 27th of his eight-year career, according to
Stats LLC.
</P>
<P>
Feely and his counterpart on the Arizona Cardinals, Neil Rackers,
enjoy tackling so much that they made a friendly wager before
their teams played in September over who would make more tackles
in the game. Neither was credited with even an assist, although
Rackers has recorded six tackles this season to lead all kickers.

In November, Jacksonville punter Adam Podlesh proved the folly of
having a kicker channel his inner Ray Lewis when he sustained a
season-ending knee injury in his money leg while trying to make a
tackle. Podlesh said he had since experienced fleeting thoughts
that maybe he should avoid tackling to keep himself healthy. Then
again, he doubts he will shy away next season.
</P>
<P>
"It's kind of cool getting down there and living the glory days
of high school," said Podlesh, who was a starting linebacker in
high school and has been relatively prolific with five tackles
the past two seasons. "At the same time, it's also a job. In my
mind, I might as well try. One thing I don't like is people
questioning my effort."
