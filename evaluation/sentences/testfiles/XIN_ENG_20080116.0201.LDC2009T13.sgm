Arab League chief visits Beirut again to mediate political crisis

CAIRO, Jan. 16 (Xinhua)
</P>
<P>
Arab League (AL) Secretary General Amr Moussa headed for Lebanon
Wednesday afternoon on a visit to resume efforts on settling the
Lebanese political crisis, the Egyptian official MENA news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
It's the second visit in one week by the chief of the pan-Arab
bloc to Lebanon for finding a solution to the ongoing Lebanese
political crisis.
</P>
<P>
On Jan. 12, Moussa left Beirut after a four-day-long marathon
talks with Lebanon's rival factions, failing to install an three-
point Arab initiative aimed at ending the presidential crisis.
</P>
<P>
The Arab plan, which was approved at an Arab foreign ministers'
meeting earlier this month, aimed at immediately electing
Lebanese Army Commander Gen. Michel Suleiman as Lebanese
president, proceeding to forming a national unity government and
drafting a new electoral law.
</P>
<P>
Following an bombing attack on Tuesday that killed at least three
and wounded more than 20 others in Beirut, Moussa urged all
parties concerned to exert utmost efforts for finding a solution
to the Lebanese crisis.
</P>
<P>
Having been rocked by a series of bombing attacks in the past
three years, Lebanon is currently facing its most serious
political crisis since the end of the 1975-1990 civil war.
</P>
<P>
For the first time in its history, the presidential seat has been
void for more than 50 days since Nov. 24 when former President
Emile Lahoud stepped down and the sharply divided Lebanese
parliament has delayed the elections for 12 times without a
consensus.
