AmCham unveils recommendations for Taiwan's presidential
candidates

Taipei,  Dec. 1 (CNA) 12/01/07  13:54:58 (By Sofia Wu)
</P>
<P>
The American Chamber of Commerce in Taipei (AmCham) has published
a special report titled Vision 2020 on Taiwan's future to serve
as its recommendations for the presidential candidates of the
country's two largest political parities.
</P>
<P>
AmCham said in a news release issued Friday that Taiwan has the
potential to enjoy immense business opportunities over the coming
decade or more in high-tech industries, financial services and
other areas of the economy.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, it pointed out that achieving such success will
depend on numerous factors, particularly how well Taiwan
overcomes its current reluctance to tap fully into the mega-
growth taking place in China's economy.
</P>
<P>
"It will also be necessary to boost competitiveness through such
steps as revamping tax policy, restructuring the financial
system, carrying out educational reform,  creating a more
transparent, consistent and even-handed regulatory regime, and
liberalizing rules on work permits for foreign and mainland
Chinese professionals," said the AmCham press release.
</P>
<P>
Even more fundamentally, the news release went on, Taiwan will
need to maintain stable cross-Taiwan Strait relations, adopt a
more outward-looking  and internationalist  mindset,  strengthen
its democratic institutions and build a more collaborative
domestic political environment.
</P>
<P>
These are the major conclusions in Vision 2020, a special issue
of Taiwan Business TOPICS that was published this week, the news
release said. TOPICS is a monthly magazine published by AmCham.
</P>
<P>
According to the AmCham news release, Vision 2020 contains 14
articles by prominent Taiwanese and international commentators,
attempting to look beyond short-term issues to identify what
Taiwan should wish to be like in the year 2020 and what will be
required to attain this.
</P>
<P>
In an accompanying editorial in the issue of Taiwan Business
TOPICS, AmCham Taipei states that the necessary progress can only
be attained through vigorous, clear-minded and enlightened
leadership.
</P>
<P>
"It is therefore particularly timely that Vision 2020 is being
published in the midst of the campaign for the presidential
election of next March," notes the editorial.
</P>
<P>
The editorial further recommends that the presidential and vice
presidential nominees and their aides regard the special section
as a useful source of reference as they put together the policy
objectives that will define their candidacies.
</P>
<P>
"After the election, the winning team might well give these
papers a rereading as a reminder of what needs to be tackled
during their term in office to help set the stage for a
politically stable, economically flourishing and socially just
Taiwan in 2020," it adds.
</P>
<P>
Following is a list of the 14 contributors and their major
themes:
</P>
<P>
-- Setting the Agenda: A Roadmap to Revitalization by Michael
Kurtz, senior managing director at Bear Stearns Asia Ltd. in Hong
Kong.With a fuller embrace of mainland Chinese commercial
opportunities, radical tax overhaul, financial- sector
restructuring, renewed commitment to a strong currency, and
educational reform, Taiwan could resuscitate economic growth and
preserve its place among the world's most advanced economies
through 2020 and beyond. But if political division and inertia
continue to prevent policymakers from addressing these vital
challenges, future Taiwanese may be left to ponder nostalgically:
'What went wrong?'

-- Economic Development: Moving up the Global Value Chain by Chen
Tain-jy, professor of economics, National Taiwan University, and
former president of the Chung-Hwa Institute for Economic

the educational system, increase funding for research activities,
and provide support for industries that take time to develop.
</P>
<P>
-- Regional Relations: The Need to Take Advantage of Location by
Philip Bowring, columnist for the International Herald Tribune
and former editor of the Far Eastern Economic Review.Taiwan has
the money, the people skills, the geography, and most of the

will, and the level of governance needed to create an identity
founded on its role in Asia and the world, transcending debates
on who is or is not Chinese.
</P>
<P>
-- High-tech Industry: Infrastructure in Place for Further
Expansion by Peter Kurz, Managing Director and Head of Research,

</P>
<P>
-- Service Sector: The Path to Greater Productivity and Higher
Income by Peter Sutton, Head of Taiwan Research, CLSA Asia
Pacific Markets.Removing restrictions on air travel to China and
easing the issuance of business visas to PRC passport-holders are

return head-office activity to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
-- Financial Sector: Opportunities from New Markets and New
Products by Schive Chi, Chair Professor of Economics at Shih Hsin
University and former president of the Taiwan Academy of Banking
and Finance.Some huge opportunities will present themselves to
Taiwan's financial institutions in the period before 2020. How
well they are able to take advantage of those opportunities will
depend both on their own preparedness and on the regulatory
approaches adopted by the government.
</P>
<P>
-- Democratic Consolidation: Inspired Political Reform Requires
Effective Leadership by Richard C. Bush, senior fellow and
director of the Center for Northeast Asia Policy Studies at the
Brookings Institution in Washington, D.C. and former chairman of

reformist coalition ... to get politicians to rise above
parochial interests and focus on national imperatives ... and to
foster public support for change.

Chen, former foreign minister and Taiwan representative to the
United States and the European Union.To achieve our diplomatic

Dynamics by Bonnie Glaser, senior associate at the Center for
Strategic &amp; International Studies, Washington, D.C.Based on

attendant risks, Taipei could remove barriers to cross-strait
flow of people, goods and services, and investment long before
2020.
</P>
<P>
-- Defense: A Security Challenge of Towering Complexity by Eric
A. McVadon, Rear Admiral (Retired) , U.S. Navy.A strategy for the
future designed to better ensure U.S. support, develop

Practical by R.C.T. Lee, former president of National Chi Nan
