<P>
Italy's budget deficit widened to 6.4 percent of gross domestic
product in the third quarter of 2006 from 2.8 percent of GDP in
the corresponding quarter of 2005, as state spending rose more
than income, statistics office Istat said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
However, in the first nine months of 2006, the budget deficit
narrowed to 4.1 percent of GDP from 4.3 percent in the
corresponding period of 2005, Istat said.
</P>
<P>
The sharp increase in the deficit to GDP ratio, up from 0.3
percent in the second quarter of 2006, was due to the
implementation of a European Court of Justice ruling in
September, which allows companies to claim refunds for company
cars that the state had wrongly denied them, an Istat official
said.
</P>
<P>
Net of this expense, the deficit to GDP ratio in the third
quarter of 2006 would have been 1.7 percent, compared with 2.5
percent in the year-earlier period, an Istat official said.
</P>
<P>
In the third quarter, state income was up 4.8 percent on the
year, while state spending rose 13.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
Istat said Italy's primary deficit was euro7.4 billion (US$9.6
billion) in the third quarter of 2006, or -2 percent of GDP. It
widened from the same quarter of 2005, when there was a surplus
of euro5.87 billion (US$7.64 billion), or 1.7 percent of GDP.
</P>
<P>
Current spending rose 3.4 percent, as spending for state
employees rose 7 percent on the year, and welfare spending rose
3.9 percent.
