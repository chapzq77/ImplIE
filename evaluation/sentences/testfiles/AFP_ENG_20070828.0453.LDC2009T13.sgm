Armed men ambushed a military convoy in the north-east of Mali
and seized three military vehicles, just a day after 15 soldiers
were kidnapped from the same zone, sources said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"A Malian military convoy was ambushed. The assailants took three
vehicles maybe with the passengers, maybe not," a local official
from the Kidal region said, adding that the attack took place on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the raid was
staged on an arterial road near the west African country's border
with Algeria.
</P>
<P>
"We have sent a big military contingent to the area to hunt down
the criminals and to ensure that our citizens are safe," the
source said.

Tuareg rebels from a new group that has reneged on a peace accord
with Mali's government on Sunday kidnapped 15 soldiers from an
eastern town and fled in the direction of neighbouring Niger,
Malian security officials said.
</P>
<P>
The soldiers snatched in Tedjerete were among troops posted in
the northern part of Mali's sprawling border to protect agro-
science technicians working to prevent a locust infestation in
the sub-Saharan region, the army said.
</P>
<P>
"Fifteen of our forces have been kidnapped and taken hostage by
armed men in Tedjerete. With their abductors they took the
direction of the Niger border," a senior army officer serving in
the region told AFP, asking not to be named.
</P>
<P>
Several security sources said Tuareg leader Ibrahim Ag Bahanga,
who comes from Mali but has taken refuge among militants of the
desert people still fighting in Niger, was behind the kidnapping.
</P>
<P>
"This was Ibrahim Ag Bahanga's work," a local military source
told AFP. "We know. Those were his methods and the day it
happened, witnesses really saw him. Now you see him, now you
don't, this is his doing."
</P>
<P>
The dissident leader, whose father-in-law Hama Ag Sidahmed has
also broken with other former rebels and formed alliances in
Niger, is said to have carried out a May 11 attack on an army
post killing 10 soldiers.
</P>
<P>
Security sources say he then crossed the border to shelter with
Niger's Tuareg rebel Nigerien Movement for Justice (MNJ).
