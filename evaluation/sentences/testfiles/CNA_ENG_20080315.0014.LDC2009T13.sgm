President touts rising Taiwanese identity as his political legacy
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taipei, March 15 (CNA) 03/15/08  14:36:15 (By Sofia Wu)
</P>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian touted Friday his insistence on Taiwan's
separate identity, the consolidation and deepening of Taiwan's
young democracy, and the upholding of freedom of the press as his
political legacies.
</P>
<P>
"I feel I have done right in standing firm on carving out a
distinct Taiwanese identity separate from China and working hard
to consolidate and deepen our young democracy," said a confident
Chen in an interview with cable television station TVBS.
</P>
<P>
Reviewing his eight years in office, Chen said he also feels he
has not let the country down in maintaining peace and stability
in the Taiwan Strait and in promoting closer cross-strait
exchanges.
</P>
<P>
"Despite occasional tension in cross-strait relations over the
past years, none of them have ever deteriorated into a conflict
or crisis. The situation has consistently been brought under
control and cross-strait relations have generally remained stable
and peaceful, as well as growing ever-closer economically," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Asked about how a national leader should react to a national
crisis, Chen said that although things may differ in nature and
require different response strategies, fundamental beliefs and
core values should be upheld without change. "Without fundamental
convictions, a national leader will be prone to wavering," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Chen went on, resilience is very important. "A national
leader must have the capacity to cope with stress, pressure and
adversity and should not flip-flop on key policy issues under
pressure from interest groups or the media," he added.
</P>
<P>
Noting that a national leader must take a stance conducive to
national interests and the well-being of the people, Chen said
Taiwan's president must insist on taking the correct path in the
face of pressure from China and the international community,
referring to his adamant attitude toward the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) -initiated referendum on seeking U.N.
membership under the name of Taiwan, despite opposition from the
United States, Europe and China. The referendum is set to take
place alongside the March 22 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
As to whether he felt despondent about the extremely low voter
turnout for the two referendums  held alongside the Jan.  12
legislative elections, Chen replied: "Not at all."
</P>
<P>
"Even though the referendums failed to pass the legal thresholds
required for them to take effect, I don't think they were flops,"
Chen argued.
</P>
<P>
One of the referendums was initiated by the DPP and asked voters
whether the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) should be required
to return to the national coffers its ill-gotten party assets.
</P>
<P>
"The number of `yes' ballots cast for the `KMT assets' referendum
was even higher than the total ballots the DPP garnered in the
legislative elections," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
As a matter of fact, he went on, the gap between voter turnout
for the legislative elections and the "KMT assets" referendum --
58.5 percent to 26 percent -- was slightly lower than the
difference between the 2004 presidential election and the two
defensive referendums held alongside -- 80 percent to 45 percent.
</P>
<P>
In the 2004 presidential poll, Chen took 6.47 million ballots,
while the number of ballots cast in each of the two defensive
referendums held exceeded 7 million.
</P>
<P>
"None of the four national referendums held in the past was
successful, mainly because of the unreasonably high legal
threshold set forth by our existing Referendum Act, " Chen said,
adding that he looks forward to seeing the law amended to lower
the threshold.
</P>
<P>
Referring to his other legacies, Chen said he is gratified with
the implementation of an alternative minimum tax system and a
portable pension system, as well as the legislation of a national
pension act that will take effect in October.
</P>
<P>
"All these moves are no easy task and we have made them at a
price far lower than that endured by many other countries, " Chen
said, adding that the enactment of these new systems have
delivered on his campaign promises.
</P>
<P>
Chen refrained from commenting in detail on a recent incident
involving four KMT lawmakers who gatecrashed DPP presidential
candidate Frank Hsieh's campaign headquarters in an attempt to
investigate whether Hsieh was unlawfully using the building,
which belongs to the state-controlled First Financial Holding
Co., as his campaign office.
</P>
<P>
"We should look at the incident from a macro-perspective, rather
than just taking it as an isolated case. We should pay more heed
to the impact of the expanding legislative power, which has led
to many unprecedented  developments and phenomena over the past
years, including a six-month delay in legislative passage of the
government budgets and unconstitutional  provisions  included  in
statutes regarding the National Communications Commission and the
319 Truth Commission," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
On a KMT legislative caucus plan to enact a statute governing
presidential power transition that will freeze the outgoing
president's personnel and policy-making rights following every
presidential election, Chen said such stipulations will violate
constitutional provisions, as the president's powers and duties
are prescribed in the Constitution, which cannot be overridden by
an act passed by the lawmaking body.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chen revealed that he plans to come up with a new
nomination list for Control Yuan seats for confirmation by the
legislature, in which the KMT controls a more-than two-thirds
majority. The country's top government watchdog body has remained
empty since the term of previous Control Yuan members expired in
January 2005 as the opposition-controlled legislature refused to
review the Chen-proposed list.
</P>
<P>
"The roster will comprise elite members from relevant
professional fields, " Chen said, adding that he hopes the
legislature will not boycott his nomination this time around.
</P>
<P>
With just slightly more than two months to go before his eight-
year tenure expires, Chen said he keenly hopes that political
bickering and antagonism between the KMT-led "pan-blue alliance"
and the DPP-led "pan-green camp" can come to an end along with
his retirement May 20.
</P>
<P>
In another interview with the London-based Financial Times
earlier in the week, Chen also touted his administration's
achievements in overseeing a shift in sentiment for "Taiwanese
identity" that appears irreversible.
</P>
<P>
"According to opinion polls, more than 70 percent of Taiwan's
citizens now see themselves as Taiwanese rather than Chinese, up
from about 30 percent before the DPP took power, " Chen told the
Financial Times.
</P>
<P>
"If there hadn't been the past eight years of DPP rule and myself
as president, Taiwan would have been taken by China after six
years, " he said. "That is because of our insistence that Taiwan
is a sovereign country, that Taiwan and the PRC are two sovereign
countries that do not belong to each other."
</P>
<P>
Calling the rise of a distinct Taiwanese identity "a road of no
return, " Chen argued in the interview that while Taiwan and
China have moved closer to each other economically, they are
moving even further apart politically,  thanks to the DPP
administration's efforts.
