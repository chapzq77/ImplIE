ABU DHABI, March 30 (Xinhua)
</P>
<P>
A cooperation agreement has been signed between the Dubai Police
and the United Nations for enhancing the capabilities of the
Dubai Police in minimizing the spread of drugs at local and
regional levels, local newspaper Khaleej Times reported on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Signed on Thursday by Dhahi Khalfan Tamim, Dubai Police
Commander-in-Chief, and Antonio Maria Costa, Executive Director
of the UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), the agreement
focuses on formulation and implementation of anti-drug strategies
to reduce the demand for drugs by spreading awareness among the
youth, the report said.
</P>
<P>
According to the agreement, the Dubai Police will play a crucial
role in preparation of national plans to minimize use of drugs in
the United Arab Emirates (UAE), the report added.
</P>
<P>
Drug traffickers in Asia were smuggling heroin and causing HIV/
AIDS, and the narcotics money providing resources to organized
crime and terrorist groups, Dhahi was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
In view of the fact that the use of drugs has increased in the
Arab world, governments of Arab countries should cooperate to
curb the menace and minimize its use by the youth, Dhahi added.

<P>
Established in 1997, the Vienna-headquartered UNODC is mandated
to assist UN member states in their struggle against illicit
drugs, crime and terrorism.
