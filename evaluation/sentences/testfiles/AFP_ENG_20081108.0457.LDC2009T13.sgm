Britain revokes visa of ousted Thai PM Thaksin: airline official
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
British authorities have revoked the visas of ousted Thai prime
minister Thaksin Shinawatra and his wife Pojaman, an airline
official told AFP Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
British embassy had informed all airlines in an email on Friday
not to allow the couple to board flights to Britain.
</P>
<P>
"The British embassy sent an email message to all airlines....
It's general practice for all airlines, so no airline can take
them on board to England from any port," he said.
</P>
<P>
Embassy officials refused to confirm or deny the report, but in
the email seen by AFP, Bangkok-based immigration liaison manager
Andy Gray, from the UK Border Agency wrote:
</P>
<P>
"The United Kingdom Border Agency has revoked the UK visas held
by the following Thai nationals: Thaksin Shinawatra, Thai
Passport Number D215863; Potjaman Shinawatra, Thai Passport
Number D206635.
</P>
<P>
"The UK visas contained in the passports of the individuals
listed above are no longer valid for travel. Airlines are advised
not to carry these passengers to the UK."
</P>
<P>
Thaksin, ousted in a 2006 coup, fled to Britain in early August
and has since been sentenced in absentia to two years in prison
for corruption.
</P>
<P>
His exact whereabouts on Saturday were unknown, but local media
reported he was travelling from China to the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Thaksin's Thailand-based spokesman said he could not confirm the
report.
</P>
<P>
"What I can verify is that Thaksin has not received any document
from the British authorities concerning this issue.... But if
it's true Thaksin can clarify the matter," said Phonthep
Thepkanjana.
