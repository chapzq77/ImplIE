Several thousand people gathered late Tuesday in the downtown
Belgrade to cheer swimmer Milorad Cavic who won a silver medal at
the Olympic Games in Bejing, the first ever for Serbia, losing by
one-hundredth of a second to the invincible Michael Phelps."I am
very happy to have fought and was fearless" swimming next to
Phelps, Cavic told reporters upon his return, before cheering the
crow in front of Belgrade's City Hall.

However, "I regret that I was not faster. I've come close to the
gold, but this is still better than I expected," he said.

In the men's 100m butterfly on Saturday, Phelps snatched victory
by one- hundredth of a second over Cavic, winning his seventh out
of a record eight golds in Bejing.

However, Cavic became a national hero as he won the first medal
at the Olympics for Serbia, appearing for the first time as an
independent state since the demise of the former former
Yugoslavia.
