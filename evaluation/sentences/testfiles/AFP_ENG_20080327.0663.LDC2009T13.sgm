Top adviser to Thai king denies role in coup
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The top adviser to Thailand's king denied Thursday that he was
involved in the 2006 coup against former premier Thaksin
Shinawatra, whose allies are now back in power.
</P>
<P>
Prem Tinasulanond, head of the Privy Council, said he was not
concerned that he might become a target for political retribution
by the new government, who took power after winning elections in
December.
</P>
<P>
"I have done nothing," he told reporters in the most explicit
denial he has made about his role in the coup. "I am not involved
in politics or anything related to politics."
</P>
<P>
Thaksin's allies have accused Prem, a former prime minister who
is widely seen as the public voice of Thailand's revered King
Bhumibol Adulyadej, of masterminding the putsch in September
2006.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Samak Sundaravej, who was tapped by Thaksin to
lead his supporters in the elections, is one of the few
politicians who dares feud publicly with Prem.
</P>
<P>
Samak has alleged that an "invisible hand" is trying to bring
down his government, though he did not name anyone.
