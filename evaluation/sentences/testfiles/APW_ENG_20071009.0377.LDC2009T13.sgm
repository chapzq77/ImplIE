Belgian coalition talks make first progress in 4 months

<P>
Coalition talks to form a new Belgian government made their first
palpable progress in four months on Tuesday when Christian
Democrats and Liberals agreed on a tougher asylum policy and
limited economic migration.
</P>
<P>
The agreement came 120 days after general elections and the
continued stalemate between the Dutch-speaking and Francophone
negotiators had raised fears that the bilingual country was about
to break up.
</P>
<P>
Despite the partial breakthrough, all the key issues on how to
grant more autonomy to Dutch-speaking Flanders, Francophone
Wallonia and bilingual Brussels while maintaining a sense of
unity remained on the table.
</P>
<P>
"Overall, I am extremely pleased with the result," said Jo
Vandeurzen, the head of the Flemish Christian Democrats, whose
party will likely provide the next prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Under the provisional deal which will only come into effect if
the parties form a government, non-EU citizens will be able to
come to Belgium to fill jobs when there are not enough EU
candidates.
</P>
<P>
The negotiators also said the asylum and possible eviction
processes must be speeded up and they toughened rules on non-EU
citizens bringing their families to Belgium.
</P>
<P>
The June 10 elections left the country's political parties in a
deadlock. The Christian Democrats and Liberals, each split into
Dutch and French-speaking parties, won a majority of the 150
legislative seats. But they fell short of the two-thirds majority
needed for constitutional reform granting Flanders and Wallonia
more powers.
</P>
<P>
Since those elections they have bickered on how to push through
more autonomy, with the Flemish parties seeking more powers to
govern their own affairs and their Francophone counterparts
trying to hold on to as much nationwide solidarity as possible.
</P>
<P>
The country is divided between Dutch-speaking Flanders in the
north and Francophone Wallonia in the south. In the middle lies
the capital, Brussels, which is officially bilingual. About 6.5
million Belgians speak Dutch, compared with 4 million
Francophones.
</P>
<P>
Yves Leterme, head of the Dutch-speaking Christian Democrats, is
trying to form a government after he won the election on a
platform which called for more regional autonomy. His is in the
midst of his second attempt after the first bid failed after five
weeks of fruitless talks.
</P>
<P>
Francophones say enough powers have been shifted to Flanders and
Wallonia in the last 25 years. They accuse Flemish politicians of
engineering the demise of Belgium as a unified state.
