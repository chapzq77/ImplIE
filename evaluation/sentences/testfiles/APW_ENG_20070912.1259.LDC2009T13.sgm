ALGEMESI, Spain 2007-09-12 17:45:07 UTC

<P>
Italian cyclist Alessandro Petacchi won the 11th stage of the
Spanish Vuelta in a sprint finish on Wednesday and Denis Menchov
retained his overall lead.
</P>
<P>
Petacchi, a sprint specialist for Team Milram, crossed the line
in 4 hours, 45 minutes, 34 seconds, slightly ahead of countryman
Paolo Bettini of Quick Step-Innergetic, who finished with the
same time.
</P>
<P>
"My teammates were fighting for me the whole way and I ended up
doing pretty well as a result," said Petacchi, who collected his
18th career Vuelta stage win. "(Tuesday's rest day) helped me
recover a lot. I just hope that as of now I can maintain this
level ... or do even better."
</P>
<P>
Petacchi also hoped the win would ease some of the problems he's
experienced off the bike.
</P>
<P>
"I really wanted it because after the Giro I've had all these
problems that everybody knows about and I just hope to resolve
them quickly," Petacchi said.
</P>
<P>
The 33-year-old Italian will face the Court of Arbitration for
Sport after returning a "nonnegative" test for an asthma drug
after winning the 11th stage of the Giro d'Italia on May 23.
Though cleared by his national federation, Petacchi skipped the
Tour de France after refusing to sign the UCI's anti-doping
charter.
</P>
<P>
Former winner Menchov of Rabobank came in 22nd with the same time
to retain the overall leader's gold jersey with a time of
44:27:25, leading countryman Vladimir Efimkin of Caisse d'Epargne
by 2:01.
</P>
<P>
Tour de France runner-up Cadel Evans is in third place, trailing
Menchov by 2:27.
</P>
<P>
Petacchi's teammate Erik Zabel was third on the 191.3-kilometer
(118.9-mile) leg, while Andre Greipel of T-Mobile and Francaise
des Jeux's Carlos De Cruz rounded out the top five.
</P>
<P>
Sprinters will also be favored in Thursday's relatively flat 12th
stage from Algemesi to Hellin, a 176-kilometer (109.4-mile) ride
that loops through four provinces.
