Union leader calls for Guinea negotiations to restart as death
toll from protests rises
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CONAKRY, Guinea 2007-02-15 00:51:26 UTC
</P>
<P>
Soldiers fired into the air in the suburbs of Guinea's capital as
the death toll from days of violent protests rose to 64 and union
leaders urged renewed negotiations with the government -- but
stopped short of backing off demands that the president step
down.
</P>
<P>
Rabiatou Serah Diallo, head of one of the West African country's
major unions, called for negotiations with the government to
recommence. Along with opposition politicians and other union
heads, Diallo has demanded in recent days that President Lansana
Conte resign from power.
</P>
<P>
The opposition leaders and trade unions accuse Conte, the ailing
leader who seized power over two decades ago in an army coup, of
violating a power-sharing agreement by naming a political ally as
prime minister.
</P>
<P>
At least 64 people have been killed in Guinea since the weekend
in violent protest and during martial law in the West African
country, a local human rights group said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Thierno Madjou Sow, president of Conakry's League of Human
Rights, said the deaths since Saturday bring his group's tally to
at least 120 killed since a first general strike began in mid-
January.
</P>
<P>
The weekend rioting and clashes between protesters and security
forces led Conte to declare martial law Monday night, imposing a
curfew for all but a few daylight hours and banning all public
gatherings.
</P>
<P>
Yet as nightfall brought the return of a curfew to the center of
the capital, Conakry, children could be seen playing soccer in
the street and some residents strolled down the roads. Much of
the violence has taken place outside the city center, in suburbs
and the interior of Guinea.
</P>
<P>
Sow said his group received reports of 21 deaths from gunshot
wounds in Conakry's suburbs over Tuesday and Wednesday, and
another 43 deaths outside the capital.
</P>
<P>
The violence started after Conte appointed his close ally Eugene
Camara, a Cabinet member since 1997, as prime minister. The post
had been left vacant since Conte, who seized power in a 1984
coup, fired Prime Minister Cellou Dalein Diallo in April.
</P>
<P>
Last month, Conte agreed to appoint a consensus prime minister
who was not a current member of his government in a deal to end a
two-week national strike that brought Guinea to an economic
standstill and sparked clashes that left at least 59 dead.
</P>
<P>
Diallo said union leaders want to restart negotiations with the
government, but have not come up with a specific plan to do so.
</P>
<P>
"We need to meet, we need to dialogue, we need to accept each
other, we need to listen to each other," Diallo told The
Associated Press by telephone. "We need, urgently, to find
ourselves around the same table."
</P>
<P>
Diallo said the unions had been unable to meet among themselves
or with colleagues since Friday, making it impossible to discuss
their next steps.
</P>
<P>
Still, Diallo said the unions were not planning to change their
demands, which they say were ignored when Conte appointed Camara
as prime minister.
</P>
<P>
"We stay behind our draft agreement which must be respected," she
said. She did not say if this meant the unions were no longer
calling for Conte to resign.
</P>
<P>
Many said Conte sidestepped the agreement by naming a confidant,
and angry youths took to the streets, throwing stones and
ransacking buildings. Security forces fired into the crowds.
</P>
<P>
Diallo asked the international community to step in to help
Guinea resolve its crisis.
</P>
<P>
Medical officials and witnesses said at least 27 people were
killed in the first three days of protests -- most of those
deaths in the capital from gunshot wounds.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Embassy ordered all staff family members to leave Guinea
and urged private U.S. citizens to go as well. The embassy flew
out about 25 people on a U.S. government plane to Dakar, Senegal.
The U.S. government also sent a military team of about 20 people
into Guinea to beef up embassy security, according to U.S.
European command.
</P>
<P>
Conakry's airport reopened late Tuesday for an Air France flight
-- the first commercial plane to fly since the fighting started
Saturday. A crowd of more than 2,000 had gathered at the airport,
and witnesses said most were clamoring to get on the flight to
Paris. By Wednesday afternoon, the airport was nearly empty.
</P>
<P>
Opposition leaders say the ailing president has let corruption
overrun Guinea as people struggle to meet basic needs.
</P>
<P>
Guinea's 10 million people are impoverished and many live without
the most basic public services, even though the country has half
the world's reserves of bauxite, used to produce aluminum.
</P>
<P>
Conte said martial law will continue through Feb. 23.
