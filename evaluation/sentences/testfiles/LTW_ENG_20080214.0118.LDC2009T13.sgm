Australian Diabetes Study Contradicts U.S. Findings
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Physicians and patients were shocked by last week's announcement
because it seemed to contradict a long-held tenet of diabetes
treatment -- that reducing blood glucose levels as much as
possible improves patient health.
</P>
<P>
The new study, with nearly twice as much data as the American one
and a longer follow-up time, provides some reassurance that the
paradigm has not been overturned. But there are enough
differences between the two studies to cloud the source of the
discrepancy, experts said.
</P>
<P>
Doctors had already warned diabetics not to alter their treatment
regimens, and the new findings from the George Institute for
International Health in Sydney reinforced that warning.
</P>
<P>
"I think the message is, `Don't do anything until we get this
sorted out,' " said Richard Kahn, chief scientific and medical
officer of the American Diabetes Association.
</P>
<P>
The American trial, known as ACCORD, focused on 10,251 patients
in the U.S. and Canada with Type 2 diabetes who either had heart
disease or were at high risk of developing it. About 65 percent
of the 284,000 deaths linked to diabetes each year are caused by
heart disease.
</P>
<P>
In the two arms of the trial, physicians used various
combinations of lifestyle changes and drugs to reduce blood
glucose levels -- as measured by concentrations of glycated
hemoblobin, or A1C -- to either 6 percent or to between 7 percent
and 7.5 percent. Healthy individuals have an A1C level of about 6
percent, while normal treatment regimens achieve levels of 7
percent to 7.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
In a news conference Feb. 6, the ACCORD team said it was
abandoning the intensive-treatment arm of the study because a
preliminary analysis showed an excess of deaths in that group --
257 compared to 203 in the standard-treatment group.
</P>
<P>
In light of that announcement, Dr. Stephen MacMahon of the George
Institute asked the data monitoring and safety committee for his
own study, called ADVANCE, to look for excess deaths among its
participants.
</P>
<P>
The ADVANCE study enrolled 11,140 high-risk patients in Europe,
Asia, Australia and Canada and had treatment goals similar to
that of the ACCORD trial.
</P>
<P>
"The interim results from ADVANCE provide no confirmation of the
adverse mortality trend reported from the ACCORD study," Dr. Rory
Collins of the University of Oxford in England, chairman of the
data monitoring committee, said in an e-mailed statement. He also
noted that the interim results were based on twice as much data
and similar levels of glucose control as the ACCORD study.
</P>
<P>
No other results from the study were released. A final report is
expected later this year, along with results from a third trial
that is also underway.
</P>
<P>
Experts were at a loss to explain the difference between the two
studies. One possibility is that the Americans in the trial were
heavier, and thus at higher risk of death from heart disease. The
patients in the ACCORD trial also received a drug that is not
available in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Physicians said they hope that publication of all three reports
will enable them to resolve the discrepancies.
