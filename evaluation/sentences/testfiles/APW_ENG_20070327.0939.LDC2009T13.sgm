Indonesia agrees to start sharing bird flu virus samples with WHO

JAKARTA, Indonesia 2007-03-27 14:41:00 UTC

<P>
Indonesia will resume sending bird flu virus specimens to the
World Health Organization immediately, the health minister said
Tuesday, ending a four-month standoff health officials feared
could potentially put the entire world at risk.
</P>
<P>
Health Minister Siti Fadiliah Supari had earlier refused to share
samples with the global body, saying she was afraid they would be
used to develop vaccines that would be ultimately unaffordable
for poor nations in the event of a pandemic.
</P>
<P>
International scientists argued that, without specimens, they
could not monitor the virus that has killed 66 people in
Indonesia -- a third of the world's total -- to see if it was
mutating into a more dangerous form.
</P>
<P>
"We will start sending bird flu samples to the World Health
Organization immediately," Supari told reporters after receiving
assurances from the global body that viruses would only be given
to pharmaceutical companies with Indonesia's consent.
</P>
<P>
"Now we have the right to directly face the companies to
negotiate to get what we want," the health minister said. "We
trust WHO will not violate our trust, because this is related to
the WHO's credibility."
</P>
<P>
The unexpected announcement came on the second day of talks in
the capital Jakarta between Supari, top WHO officials, regional
health chiefs and international avian influenza experts. The
meeting wraps up Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"We will keep those viruses and not share them with any
industry," David Heymann, the WHO's top flu official, said at a
joint press conference. "There will be a mechanism to determine
how that is done in a transparent way."
</P>
<P>
For weeks, Supari has been demanding that the global body change
its 50-year-old virus sharing system, in which it collects
regular flu samples from all over the world and makes them
available to vaccine makers and others.
</P>
<P>
"These practices keep developing countries poor and sick," Supari
said Tuesday night. "The system is more dangerous than bird flu
itself."
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's decision to withhold the virus had received support
from some other developing nations.
</P>
<P>
Heymann earlier said Supari's demands would hinder research into
the virus and jeopardize public safety.
</P>
<P>
"If we don't know what's going on, it's dangerous, and here is
where the virus is most affecting humans," he told reporters late
Monday, adding that vaccine makers are already looking elsewhere
for virus samples.
</P>
<P>
"They will use other viruses, and it will leave Indonesia in
great risk," he said. "And it will leave other countries in great
risk."
</P>
<P>
Heymann suggested several ways to ensure a fairer distribution of
vaccines, among them, creating stockpiles of vaccines for use in
poor countries and transferring technology so they can produce
their own.
</P>
<P>
To ensure it has access to a bird flu vaccine, Indonesia has
reached a tentative agreement with U.S. drug manufacturer Baxter
Healthcare Corp. Under the deal, Indonesia would provide samples
of the virus in exchange for Baxter's expertise in vaccine
production. Indonesia would stockpile the vaccine for use in case
there is a major human outbreak.
</P>
<P>
Bird flu has killed at least 169 people since it began ravaging
Asian poultry stocks in 2003, according to WHO. It remains hard
for people to catch, and most human cases have been linked to
contact with sick birds. But experts fear it could mutate into a
form that spreads easily among people, potentially sparking a
pandemic that could kill millions.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia, the world's fourth-most-populous country, is seen as a
potential hotspot because of its high density of people and
chickens.
</P>
<P>
Currently, only up to about 500 million doses of flu vaccine can
be produced annually -- far short of what would be needed in a
pandemic.
