SHIPS ORDERED TO SLOW DOWN TO SAVE WHALES FOR SUNDAY, OCT. 26.

MELBOURNE, Fla. - The giant, lumbering right whales that winter
along Florida's coastline will soon be protected by a new
federally imposed speed limit on large ships, a victory for
environmentalists in a long-running struggle.
</P>
<P>
But the controversy over protecting the whales is far from over.
Some shipping industry representatives doubt the scientific
studies underpinning the rule, which will lapse in five years if
it is not renewed by federal regulators.
</P>
<P>
The measure, which takes effect in December, calls for ships over
65 feet in length to slow to 10 knots in areas out to 20 miles
offshore along the Eastern Seaboard where the whales congregate.
</P>
<P>
Environmental groups had asked the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration for a 30-mile slow-speed zone, but
nevertheless hailed the new regulation.
</P>
<P>
"It's a huge step for the right whale," said Amy Knowlton, a
research scientist at the New England Aquarium, which has studied
the whales for decades. "We're disappointed about some aspects of
the rule, but it hasn't been so watered down that it won't be
effective."
</P>
<P>
Don O'Hare, a spokesman for the World Shipping Council, a trade
group that has been critical of the rule, said shippers will
cooperate, even as they push for more studies and new
technologies they hope will protect the whales without impeding
shipping.
</P>
<P>
"While we have differences of opinion with NOAA on what the
science says should be done to protect the right whales, the
shipping industry respects their efforts and intentions with
these new regulations," O'Hare said in an e-mailed response to
the new agency rule.
</P>
<P>
Right whales, prized for their oil-rich blubber, were hunted
nearly to extinction in the 1800s. The behemoths, which grow as
large as 60 feet in length, were easy targets because of their
slow movements, their preference for near-shore waters and the
fact that their bodies floated after they were killed.
</P>
<P>
They spend their summers off the New England coast, but females
come south in winter to give birth off the coasts of Georgia and
Florida.
</P>
<P>
Along Florida's coast from Jacksonville to Palm Beach, beach-
goers are sometimes delighted to spot the whales during winter
months just a few dozen yards off the shoreline.
</P>
<P>
But many do more than simply watch; a network of some 800
volunteers have been trained to call in whale sightings, with the
information relayed to the Coast Guard, which passes the word to
ships.
</P>
<P>
"When they see a whale they call us and once we get photographers
to confirm it, we report it," said Julie Albert, coordinator of
the right whale project for the Florida Marine Resources Council,
a non-profit group based in Brevard County. "The new speed limits
will definitely be good for the whales. It's scary that there are
so few of them left."
</P>
<P>
Protected by federal regulations for decades, the whales have
still struggled to survive. Between 1991 and 2002, 14 whales were
confirmed victims of ship strikes, while 8 more died that way
between 2002 and 2007.
</P>
<P>
Scientists say more whales may be killed by ships but their
bodies never recovered. They also say entanglement in fishing
lines is another menace threatening the species.
</P>
<P>
Researchers estimate there are about 300 to 400 right whales
remaining.
</P>
<P>
Shippers say the new speed limits may cost them time and money
while not being that effective. Federal estimates say the limits
should cost less than 1 percent of the $300 billion trade value
of U.S. East Coast shipping, and should add only about an hour to
the trip into port for most ships.
</P>
<P>
Edwin Fendig III, a harbor pilot in Brunswick, Ga., said ship
captains do all they can to avoid the whales and want to see them
survive, but worry that the speed limits will increase the danger
of accidents.
</P>
<P>
"It's very unsafe for us to drive a ship at 10 knots," he said,
noting that the Brunswick shipping channel is only 500 feet wide
and holding a giant vessel on course in those confines in stormy
weather is a challenge. "We're extremely environmentally
sensitive to the whales, but if cargo isn't brought into port in
a safe and timely fashion, what will that cost the U.S.?"
</P>
<P>
The federal rule allows an exception for ship captains to exceed
the 10-knot limit if they deem it necessary for the safety of the
vessel.
</P>
<P>
Researchers have developed high-tech buoys that aid in spotting
the whales. Teams from Cornell University and Woods Hole
Oceanographic Institution have developed the devices, which
listen for whale sounds with underwater hydro-phones and then
relay the information by satellite, with the locations eventually
passed on to ships.
</P>
<P>
A network of the buoys is already deployed off parts of the New
England coast, where the whales congregate in summer. Two of the
buoys were set off the Georgia coast near Brunswick last winter,
and two will be placed this winter near the entrance to the
Jacksonville port.
</P>
<P>
"The goal is to make all the information immediately available to
shippers," said Chris Clark of Cornell's Bioacoustics Research
Program.
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists, however, point out that the buoys are only
effective if the whales are making sounds.
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't substitute for aerial surveys," the method used for
decades to locate the whales, said Vicki Cornish of the Ocean
Conservancy, an environmental group which pushed for the speed
limits. "And funding for the aerial surveys has been cut. We
really think it's important these ships slow down. It's only for
20 miles."
</P>
<P>
Cindy Dolaway, a retired teacher from New York who now lives in
Brevard County and volunteers for the whale-spotting network,
said many people don't know the whales spend part of their lives
off the Florida coastline.
</P>
<P>
"It's really exciting to see them," she said. "I tell people they
are the length of two school buses. I've seen them right on the
other side of the break off the beach."
