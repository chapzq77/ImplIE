RIO DE JANEIRO, Oct. 19 (Xinhua)
</P>
<P>
Brazil won on Sunday the final of FIFA's sixth World Indoor
Soccer in Brazil 2008, after defeating Spain 4-3 in  penalty
shootout after a draw of 2-2 in the regulation time and in the
added time.
</P>
<P>
It is Brazil's fouth indoor soccer world title. The encounter
took place at the Maracanazinho Gym in Rio de Janeiro.
</P>
<P>
Two brilliant defenses made by the goalkeeper Franklin, made
Brazil obtain again the title, which they lost in the World
Championship of Guatemala 2000 in front of the same team of
Spain.
</P>
<P>
In that occasion, the Spanish team interrupted the sequence of
consecutive titles obtained by Brazil who had won in 1989, 1992
and 1996.
</P>
<P>
The final game of the sixth World Indoor Soccer in Brazil 2008
was balanced but also tense.
</P>
<P>
The hosts, animated by the rematch and with the support of their
fans, made pressure on the first half, which made the Spanish
goalkeeper Amado felt great when defending their goal in at least
four occasions.
</P>
<P>
The first goal of the match was made by Brazilian Marquinhos, in
a corner kick at the minute 25.
</P>
<P>
When the fans were still celebrating, Falcao, who was playing
despite a knee injury, was hit and had to withdraw and watch the
match from the footstool with a bag of ice on his knee.
</P>
<P>
Three minutes later, Torras took advantage of a fault made by the
defense Gabriel to draw a goal, and the match remained tied until
the minute 36, when a sharp shoot made by Vinicius placed Brazil
again in the lead.
</P>
<P>
However, Spain persisted and when there was only one minute left
for the final, Alvaro draw a key goal and saved Spanish team.
</P>
<P>
Whether it was the tiredness or excess in caution, none of the
teams could alter the results, forcing the title to be defined in
penalties.
</P>
<P>
For that, Brazil replaced their goalkeeper Tiago by Franklin, who
ended being the hero of the day when stopping the shoots made by
Torras and Marcelo therefore restoring the crown to his team.
