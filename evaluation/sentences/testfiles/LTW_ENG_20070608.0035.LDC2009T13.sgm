Free the Old, Fix the Prisons

California's prisons are in crisis, bursting at the seams with
nearly twice as many inmates as they were designed to hold.
Things are so bad that this month federal judges will begin
holding hearings on whether to impose inmate population caps. The
Legislature's solution: build 53,000 new prison beds, at a jaw-
dropping estimated cost of $7.4 billion. Gov. Arnold
Schwarzenegger has already started transferring the first of
thousands of convicts to other states. But there's at least one
safe, simple and immediate thing the state could do that would
free up prison beds and save millions: parole inmates who are too
old to be dangerous.
</P>

Prisoners are expensive to confine, and none more so than elderly
ones. The typical inmate costs California taxpayers more than
$34,000 a year, according to the state Department of Corrections
and Rehabilitation. But elderly inmates typically cost up to
three times more, primarily because of their greater medical
needs. Many older prisoners are five to 10 years ``older''
physiologically than their chronological age, their bodies
prematurely worn down from years of alcohol and drug abuse and
the stress of prison life. According to the Washington-based
Project for Older Prisoners, the typical convict who is 55 or
older -- considered geriatric among prison experts -- will suffer
three chronic illnesses while incarcerated. And taxpayers foot
every penny of their medical bills. That's no small matter in a
state where the correctional system has grown to gargantuan
proportions. Fifteen years ago, California incarcerated about
105,000 inmates; today, it holds more than 170,000, at an annual
cost exceeding $8 billion.

Health-care costs have grown even faster. The Department of
Corrections will spend almost $1.8 billion on medical care this
year, double the amount of just five years ago. That's partly
because the number of elderly prisoners also has surged in the
last decade, the result of baby-boom demographics and ever-
lengthening sentences.
</P>
<P>
By the Department of Corrections' own count, it now holds more
than 9,000 prisoners 55 or older, many of them already in such
dismal health that they couldn't commit new crimes if they wanted
to. Nearly half of them are 60 or older. If you move the bar up
to age 70, that still leaves hundreds of inmates. Paroling just
those septuagenarians could save tens of millions of dollars
annually.
</P>
<P>
Of course, not every prisoner 55 or older could be safely
released. Many committed serious crimes and are in good enough
health that they need to be locked up. But in general, releasing
ailing elderly prisoners under the ongoing supervision of a
parole officer is a pretty safe bet. Study after study has found
that the recidivism rate for prisoners 55 or older is far lower
than that of younger ones. And the cost of monitoring a convict
in California on parole is about one-eighth that of keeping one
in prison.
</P>
<P>
There's a nonfinancial benefit, too. Letting sick, feeble old men
and women live out their last days at home with their families is
more humane than letting them slowly disintegrate in cellblocks
filled with predatory younger inmates. Even those who would wind
up alone on the outside, living off Social Security, veterans
benefits or welfare still would cost taxpayers less than keeping
them in prison.
</P>
<P>
Several other cash-strapped states are releasing nonviolent
offenders to save money, including such law-and-order bastions as
Virginia and Louisiana. California, like many states, already has
little-used policies allowing for compassionate release of sick
or elderly inmates deemed harmless.
</P>
<P>
Nobody wants to see dangerous felons let loose just to save
money. But letting hundreds of old men and women in poor health
go home, under the scrutiny of parole agents, hardly seems like
much of a threat. Would we really rather keep old convicts behind
bars and cut funding for kindergartens and hospitals?
