Texas Mandates Papilloma Virus Vaccinations

<P>
Texas on Friday became the first state to require school-age
girls be vaccinated against a virus -- typically transmitted
through sex -- that has been shown to cause cervical cancer.
</P>
<P>
Gov. Rick Perry signed an executive order mandating that most
girls, starting in September 2008, must receive the vaccination
against the human papilloma virus, or HPV, prior to entering
sixth grade.
</P>
<P>
More than a dozen states have been considering such a move. HPV,
which causes genital warts, is the most common sexually
transmitted disease in the United States. Several strains of the
virus have been linked to cervical cancer, which kills about
3,700 Americans a year, according to the Food and Drug
Administration.
</P>
<P>
The federal government approved an HPV vaccine last year, and a
government advisory panel has recommended that all girls get
shots at age 11 or 12 -- before they begin having sex. But the
American College of Pediatricians, a socially conservative group,
has opposed any vaccination requirement, calling that a
``precedent-setting action that trespasses on the right of
parents to make medical decisions for their children, as well as
on the rights of the children to attend school.''
</P>
<P>
By sidestepping the Texas Legislature, Perry -- a conservative
Republican -- avoided a showdown with GOP lawmakers and Christian
organizations that oppose mandatory HPV vaccinations on the
grounds that teaching young people to avoid pre-marital sex is a
better solution.
</P>
<P>
Perry defended his decision Friday, arguing that the vaccinations
are needed to save lives. He promised that parents who did not
want their children vaccinated ``for reasons of conscience''
would be allowed to seek exemptions. The mandate would affect
roughly 365,000 girls a year.
</P>
<P>
``The HPV vaccine provides us with an incredible opportunity to
effectively target and prevent cervical cancer,'' Perry said in a
statement. ``Requiring young girls to get vaccinated before they
come into contact with HPV is responsible health and fiscal
policy.''
</P>
<P>
Public health advocates and liberal activists praised Perry's
action, calling it a triumph of common sense over political
ideology.
</P>
<P>
``I'm surprised he took this step; it breaks with his [political]
base,'' said Kathy Miller, president of the Texas Freedom
Network, which opposes efforts to mix religion and government
policy.
</P>
<P>
But the move drew immediate criticism from conservative groups,
which noted that the governor had accepted campaign contributions
from Merck &amp; Co., the drug company that manufactures the
vaccine.
</P>
<P>
``All Merck wanted was a mandate so the insurance companies would
have to pay for this. Follow the money,'' said Cathie Adams,
president of the Texas Eagle Forum, an organization that promotes
socially conservative government policies.
</P>
<P>
``This is telling girls that they can be promiscuous and still be
safe,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
Merck has been pushing for laws mandating its Gardasil vaccine in
numerous states. It has also launched a television advertising
campaign featuring young girls and the slogan ``One less,'' to
signify one fewer cancer patient for everyone who takes the
vaccine.
</P>
<P>
The New Jersey-based drug company donated $6,000 to Perry's
reelection campaign last year, Texas campaign finance records
show. One of its top Texas lobbyists, Mike Toomey, is Perry's
former chief of staff. Merck was paying Toomey between $25,000
and $50,000 to influence politicians, according to disclosure
reports.
</P>
<P>
Perry spokeswoman Krista Moody said the state would boost
existing health care programs by $29.4 million a year to help
poorer Texans pay for the vaccines, which currently cost more
than $300 for a three-shot series.
