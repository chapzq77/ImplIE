Tennis: Chang among three elected to International Hall of Fame
</HEADLINE>

Michael Chang, the French Open's youngest men's champion, was
among three people voted into the International Tennis Hall of
Fame for 2008, the sport's honor shrine announced Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Also set to be enshrined at ceremonies here on July 12 during an
ATP event are two posthumous honorees in the contributor
category, sports agent Mark McCormack and Tennis Week founder and
publisher Gene Scott.
</P>
<P>
Their inclusion after receiving a 75 percent approval vote from a
selection committee boosts membership in the elite group to 207
people from 18 nations.
</P>
<P>
Chang won the 1989 French Open men's crown at 17 years and three
months, the first US man since Tony Trabert in 1955 to take the
title on the red clay at Roland Garros.
</P>
<P>
In his 16-year career, Chang reached the world number two ranking
and spent seven years in the top 10. He won 34 ATP titles and
lost in the finals of 24 other events, including the 1995 French
Open and 1996 US and Australian Opens.
</P>
<P>
"It's truly an honor to be inducted," Chang said. "It has been an
incredible privilege to compete against the best players in the
world for over 16 years and I will always cherish and forever
remember my experiences on tour."
</P>
<P>
McCormack died in 2003 at age 72 and revolutionized the sports
marketing business through global giant IMG.
</P>
<P>
Scott died in 2006 at age 68. He founded the weekly tennis
magazine in 1974 and served as a television analyst for the famed
1973 "Battle of the Sexes" match between Billie Jean King and
Bobby Riggs. He reached 11th in the world rankings in 1965 and
played on the US Davis Cup team from 1963 through 1965.
