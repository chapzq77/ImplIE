Mortars slam into Mogadishu airport as peacekeepers arrive in
Somalia; no deaths reported

MOGADISHU, Somalia 2007-03-06 13:01:37 UTC
</P>
<P>
Mortars slammed into Mogadishu's airport Tuesday during a
ceremony welcoming the arrival of peacekeepers. A policeman who
was at the scene said one person was wounded.
</P>
<P>
An Associated Press reporter said gunmen launched eight mortars,
but only two struck the airport. People at the airport scattered
immediately at the sound of the first blast.
</P>
<P>
Somalia's deputy defense minister, Salad Ali Jelle, refused to
comment, saying officials were investigating.
</P>
<P>
The attack came as Ugandan peacekeepers arrived in Somalia's
capital to protect the still-struggling transitional government
and to allow for the withdrawal of Ethiopian troops who helped
the government topple an Islamic militia.
</P>
<P>
The mortars were the latest example of the volatility the
peacekeepers face in a country that has seen little but anarchy
for years. Late Monday, unidentified gunmen killed seven people,
including a police commander and a leading cleric, government
officials and witnesses said. And a World Food Program ship that
was hijacked off the country's lawless coast on Feb. 25 was still
being held by pirates Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Ugandan troops are the vanguard of a larger African Union
force authorized by the United Nations to help the government
assert its authority. Ethiopian troops entered Somalia in late
December, when an Islamic movement threatened to attack the
government.
</P>
<P>
Two cargo aircraft carrying soldiers and armored vehicles touched
down at Mogadishu's main airport in the center of the city early
Tuesday and were welcomed by top government officials. Paddy
Akunda, the Ugandan forces' spokesman, said 400 troops were on
the ground so far in Mogadishu, with the remaining 1,100 expected
in the next 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
"We are very happy to be the first African Union peacekeepers to
Somalia. We are welcomed here," Akunda said during the ceremony.
"We are not imposing anything on Somalis. We know our mandate; we
will work toward restoring law and order in Somalia without
targeting anybody."
</P>
<P>
Residents were not allowed inside the airport during the
welcoming ceremony for security reasons, Jelle said. Ethiopian
and Somali troops have beefed up security in the capital.
</P>
<P>
In Uganda, Deputy Defense Minister Ruth Nankabirwa said the
troops understand the dangers of working in Somalia.
</P>
<P>
"We have not just dropped our troops there without knowing the
situation," she said. "We will be the first people to make sure
that they are safe so they can carry on to other missions."
</P>
<P>
Insurgents, believed to be the remnants of the Islamic movement
that tried to seize power last year, have staged almost daily
attacks against people associated with the government, its armed
forces or the Ethiopian military.
</P>
<P>
A police commander and another officer were ambushed late Monday
at a major intersection in the center of Mogadishu and two
bystanders were wounded in the fire fight, Mohamud Burale Coon, a
shop owner, said.
</P>
<P>
Maslah Mohamed Abdi said his brother, who was the top cleric in
one of Mogadishu's main mosques, was killed outside his home. The
same gunmen then killed four businessmen who were chewing qat, a
mild stimulant, in their home, a neighbor said.
</P>
<P>
"The men stood at the door of a room ... and then opened fire,"
Halima Hashi Adow said.
</P>
<P>
The cleric and the four men had been trying to hire gunmen to
protect them, their homes and their neighborhood. But the
insurgents use the neighborhood to launch mortar attacks on
Ethiopian bases and did not want any private security forces in
the area, residents said.
</P>
<P>
African Union Peace and Security Commissioner Said Djinnit said
the peacekeepers are allowed to defend themselves if attacked,
but would not launch attacks on anyone.
</P>
<P>
"Our mission is to support all Somalis and the political process,
which is based on dialogue and reconciliation," Djinnit told
journalists in the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa.
</P>
<P>
A Somali government spokesman, meanwhile, said local police are
prepared to fight the insurgency and crime wave.
</P>
<P>
"Security is paramount for the country to attain a lasting peace,
and law enforcement mechanisms such as the prisons and police
force are now ready," Hussein Mohamud Hussein, the spokesman,
said.
