Malaysia's "kopitiam" revival serves up competition for Starbucks
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Move over Starbucks. Traditional Malaysian "kopitiam" are making
a comeback, serving cups of local-style brew and traditional fare
as Malaysians discover a taste for nostalgia.
</P>
<P>
Kopitiam -- the word means "coffee shop" in the Hokkien dialect
of ethnic Chinese in Malaysia -- were originally found in
shophouses in villages and towns across the country, serving up
coffee and breakfast.
</P>
<P>
Usually crowded, noisy and rather grimy, they were popular places
to grab a quick drink and cheap street food.
</P>
<P>
Modern kopitiams have retained the old-fashioned marble-topped
tables, wooden chairs and chunky crockery, but now they are to be
found in the cavernous air- conditioned shopping malls of the
capital Kuala Lumpur.
</P>
<P>
And with their thick brewed "kopi," they are holding their own
against the cappuccinos and macchiatos offered by foreign coffee
chains that exploded onto the Malaysian scene in the late
nineties.
</P>
<P>
City-dwellers are rediscovering kopitiam fare such as soft-boiled
eggs eaten with soya sauce and a dash of pepper, and bread
toasted over a charcoal fire and slathered with salted butter and
kaya, a rich coconut and egg jam.
</P>
<P>
"I grew up with this. This is very nostalgic for me," said Maran
Subramaniam as he sipped a cup of aromatic kopi and munched on
kaya toast at Old Town White Coffee outlet in downtown Kuala
Lumpur.
</P>
<P>
"The coffee is cheaper than Starbucks but that's not the only
reason. I just like it," said the 31-year-old executive, dressed
in a crisp shirt and tie.
</P>
<P>
The new kopitiams also serve local favourites such as nasi lemak,
a coconut flavoured rice with a fiery sambal or chilli paste,
fried anchovies and egg on the side, and laksa -- noodles in a
spicy broth.
</P>
<P>
One popular kopitiam chain is Kluang Station which in the past
two years has opened four outlets around suburban Kuala Lumpur,
as well as one in southern Malacca.
</P>
<P>
The chain is based on the famous coffee shop at the railway
station in Kluang town in southern Johor state, opened in 1938 by
the great-grandfather of the chain's owner Phun Jun Jee.
</P>
<P>
Phun credits his grandfather with maintaining the heritage of the
original shop, where the family patriarch worked from the age of
eight, and which is now in the hands of the third generation,
Phun's uncle.
</P>
<P>
The coffee served at Kluang Station is made with beans roasted
and ground the same way it has always been prepared.
</P>
<P>
"We make coffee the traditional way. The coffee beans are roasted
with sugar and fat in the form of butter. It makes the drink
smoother," Phun said.
</P>
<P>
The kaya at Kluang Station is also from a recipe handed down by
his grandfather.
</P>
<P>
"My granddad used to make kaya in an old milk can and he would
stir it over the fire and that's all the kaya he would use in one
day," Phun said.
</P>
<P>
"Now, my kaya production has come up to four drums every three
days. Each drum uses about 1,500 eggs. It has gone from a small
amount in a tin can to enough to fill your bathtub."
</P>
<P>
Phun has also tried to recreate the atmosphere of the original
kopitiam at the train station.
</P>
<P>
"I took almost everything I could capture from the original
colonial train stations -- the wire mesh windows, the station
sign boards, the wood finish. I brought Kluang out of Kluang into
Kuala Lumpur," he said.
</P>
<P>
As nostalgia fans the growth of modern kopitiams, some of the old
coffee shops remain but no longer play a significant role in
society -- except in small towns far from Malaysia's glittering
capital.
</P>
<P>
This correspondent's father, who as a child had helped his own
father run a kopitiam in the 1940s in Taiping in northern Perak
state, has lived in Kuala Lumpur for almost 40 years.
</P>
<P>
"The new kopitiams are for the young people. The atmosphere at
these modern kopitiams is different. It doesn't give a sense of
nostalgia for old timers like us," Loh Thiam Ghee said.
</P>
<P>
Phun has plans to expand but says he will stick to urban areas.
Three more Kluang Station outlets are due to open by year-end.
</P>
<P>
"I don't intend to go very far from Kuala Lumpur and I think
there is a large untapped market. Coffee, eggs and kaya are
actually in the DNA of Malaysians," he said.
