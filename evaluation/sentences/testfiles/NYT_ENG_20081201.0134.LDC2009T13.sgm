HOW MANY CAR MODELS IS TOO MANY? NICK BUNKLEY CONTRIBUTED

</P>
<P>
For the Big Three automakers to win over Washington lawmakers in
their bid for federal aid, they will have to address a key
question in the business plans they present Congress with on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Just how serious are they about shrinking their vast lineups of
different brands and models to match the current harsh reality of
the market?
</P>
<P>
Between them, General Motors, Ford Motor and Chrysler sell 112
different car and truck models through 15 brands in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
By contrast, the top three Japanese automakers -- Toyota, Honda
and Nissan -- have roughly half as many choices with 58 models
combined sold through seven brands.
</P>
<P>
A wide range of offerings was historically a source of strength
for the American companies when they dominated the vehicle market
-- a strategy of providing a car for "every purse and purpose" as
Alfred P. Sloan, GM's leader in the 1920s and 1930s, once said.
</P>
<P>
But the Big Three now sell fewer than half of all new vehicles in
this country, with a market share of about 47 percent this year,
compared with 62 percent just five years ago.
</P>
<P>
Supporting all those models and brands with separate marketing
budgets, design teams, dealers and management divisions
represents an enormous expense, particularly for GM.
</P>
<P>
The proliferation of models is one big reason why the American
companies are losing so much money as vehicle sales slump to
their lowest point in 15 years.
</P>
<P>
As part of their plans to get $25 billion in federal aid, the
Detroit companies will be making many promises, including
symbolic ones.
</P>
<P>
For example, Ford's chief executive, Alan R. Mulally, will offer
to take a pay cut from his last year's compensation of $21
million, according to people familiar with the company's plans.
Mulally is also traveling to Washington in a Ford Escape Hybrid
(two weeks ago, the Big Three CEO's traveled by corporate jet,
inviting barbs from lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
GM and Chrysler declined to disclose the travel plans of their
leaders this time).
</P>
<P>
But the Big Three also need substantive changes to drastically
cut costs, industry analysts said, including trimming their glut
of products and sprawling distribution networks to go with their
shrinking market shares.
</P>
<P>
"Downsizing brands and models is the minimum they have to do,"
said John Casesa, a principal in the auto consulting firm the
Casesa Shapiro Group. "This can't just be about resizing the
companies, but also restructuring them."
</P>
<P>
Ford took a step on Monday toward reducing its brand lineup by
announcing plans to consider the sale of Volvo, its Swedish
luxury brand that has seen sales fall 28 percent so far this
year.
</P>
<P>
"Given the unprecedented external challenges facing Ford and the
entire industry, it is prudent for Ford to evaluate options for
Volvo," Mulally said.
</P>
<P>
GM is already trying to sell its Hummer brand. In its report to
Congress on Tuesday, the company may settle widespread
speculation that it is considering selling or eliminating the
Saab, Saturn and Pontiac brands as well.
</P>
<P>
People familiar with GM's deliberations said that the company had
previously considered a plan earlier this fall to put the Saab
and Saturn brands up for sale. But those plans were dropped
because of the lack of potential buyers. With a market share so
far this year of about 22 percent in the United States, GM is
struggling with the costs of filling showrooms with eight
separate brand lineups.
</P>
<P>
"Cutting Saab and Hummer are no-brainers because each of them has
0.2 percent of market share, so they're irrelevant," said Jerome
P. York, who was a member of GM's board during 2006. "Beyond
that, Pontiac looks very suspect to me." But shutting down a
brand also is a complicated and costly effort that requires
buying out dealers protected by state franchise laws, as well as
scaling back production of vehicles.
</P>
<P>
In 2000, GM decided to eliminate its Oldsmobile brand after its
sales fell from 1.1 million vehicles in 1985 to about 265,000 a
year. But the process took nearly four years and cost GM more
than $1 billion. Rick Wagoner, the automaker's chairman, has
repeatedly cited the problems of closing Oldsmobile as a prime
reason to avoid eliminating more brands.
</P>
<P>
GM, however, is spending down its cash hoard by $2 billion a
month, and the company has acknowledged that it is teetering
dangerously close to bankruptcy. In asking for up to $12 billion
in federal loans, Wagoner told lawmakers last month that the
company could run out of cash by the end of the year without
government assistance.
</P>
<P>
Shrinking dealer networks may be another key component of the
business plans that GM, Ford and Chrysler will present Tuesday in
an effort to convince Congress that they have viable, long-term
strategies.
</P>
<P>
GM, for example, has about 6,700 dealers in the United States,
compared to 1,200 for Toyota (the disparity is even greater when
franchises are counted -- GM dealers operate 14,000 franchises
for its many brands, compared to 1,600 franchises for Toyota).
</P>
<P>
A thorny question for GM, and to a lesser extent Ford and
Chrysler, is whether they can cut the number of dealers without
incurring huge expenses to buy them out.
</P>
<P>
The automakers are also bracing for news on Tuesday of yet
another dismal month in the marketplace. Sales of new vehicles
are expected to fall 27 percent for November from the same period
last year, according to the auto research Web site Edmunds.com
</P>
<P>
The forecasts by Edmunds.com suggest that Chrysler's sales were
down 41 percent in November, Ford's 33 percent, and GM's 28
percent.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that dealers are still being hurt by a lack of
available credit for consumers who are shopping for new vehicles.
</P>
<P>
"Until credit actually loosens up, we're going to see a
suppressed situation that is not sustainable in the long term,"
said Tom Libby, senior director of industry analysis for J.D.
Power and Associates.
