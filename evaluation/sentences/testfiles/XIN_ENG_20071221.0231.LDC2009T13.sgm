ROME, Dec. 21 (Xinhua)
</P>
<P>
The world's first cloned horse Prometea is pregnant, Italian
animal-cloning pioneer Cesare Gallo confirmed during a telephone
interview with Xinhua on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Galli, who worked at his reproduction technology farm near
Italian northern city Cremona and produced Prometea in 2003, said
the pregnancy showed that cloned animals were just as healthy as
normal ones.
</P>
<P>
"Prometea will be the first cloned horse to give birth, around
the beginning of April. This is further confirmation that clones
are completely normal if they are reared healthily," he said.
</P>
<P>
Cats, cows, bulls and mules have been among the animals cloned
since the mother of them all, Dolly the sheep, was unveiled to
acclaim and controversy in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Aside from ethical issues, opponents of cloning have raised
concerns that some animals might have reduced quality of life. It
is claimed by some that Dolly aged quickly, dying in 2003 at the
age of six and a half.
</P>
<P>
A cloned stallion called Pieraz, created in 2005, was also
expecting his first offspring, according to Italian News Agency
ANSA.
</P>
<P>
After Galli's pioneering work on horses in Italy, most of the
world's horse cloning has moved to Texas.
</P>
<P>
So far about 10 horses have been cloned, including Prometea and
Pieraz.
