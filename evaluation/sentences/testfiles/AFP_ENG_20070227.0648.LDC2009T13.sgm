Football: Bendtner puts Birmingham in pole position by Steve
Griffiths
</HEADLINE>

Nicklas Bendtner shot Birmingham back to the top of the
Championship as his first half goal secured a 1-0 win against
Leeds on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
On-loan Arsenal striker Bendtner struck early on at St Andrews
and Steve Bruce's side held onto their lead to move a point clear
of West Bromwich Albion at the top of the table.
</P>
<P>
Birmingham had led the league for several weeks earlier in the
season before slipping in recent weeks, but they were too strong
for struggling Leeds.
</P>
<P>
The Blues came close to breaking the deadlock when Gary
McSheffrey drove in a 25-yard free-kick that was just scrambled
off the line by David Healy.
</P>
<P>
Leeds' reprieve was short-lived however as McSheffrey whipped in
the resulting 15th minute corner and Bendtner headed home for his
10th goal of the season.
</P>
<P>
Dennis Wise's team were close to equalising just before the break
when Birmingham keeper Colin Doyle got a touch on Richard
Cresswell's shot to divert the ball onto a post before Martin
Taylor hacked off the line.
</P>
<P>
That was as close as Leeds came and the Elland Road outfit are
now without a win in four matches and firmly rooted to the bottom
of the table.
</P>
<P>
Norwich midfielder Simon Lappin hit a superb stoppage time winner
as his side came from behind to claim a 3-2 victory at Luton.
</P>
<P>
The kick-off at Kenilworth Road had been delayed by 15 minutes
because of power problems which prevented fans from entering the
stadium.
</P>
<P>
But Luton started well and took the lead in the 11th minute when
Bjorn Runstrom, on loan from Fulham, converted David Bell's
cross.
</P>
<P>
Norwich were level in the 26th minute as Chris Martin drove in a
perfectly- placed shot from an acute angle just inside the
penalty area.
</P>
<P>
Bell set up Luton's second in the 48th minute as he skipped
around Norwich keeper Paul Gallacher and crossed to Drew Talbot,
who looped a header into the empty net.
</P>
<P>
But Peter Grant's side refused to accept defeat and Jason
Shackell equalised in the 73rd minute with near-post header from
Youssef Safri's free-kick.
</P>
<P>
Just when it looked as though both teams had settled for a point,
Lappin won it when he bent a free-kick past Marlon Beresford from
the edge of the area for his first ever Norwich goal.
