Football: Cahill enjoys happy return with Everton winner
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Australia international Tim Cahill marked his return to the
Everton side with the winning goal in their 3-2 Premier League
victory away to top-flight newboys Stoke City here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Everton, who had been 2-0 up before the hosts fought back to 2-2,
scored the decisive fifth goal of the match in the 77th minute
when the midfielder eluded the Stoke defence to flick in a corner
from Mikel Arteta.
</P>
<P>
"That's what Tim does. He scores important goals for us and he's
won us the game today," Everton manager David Moyes who was sent
to the stands by referee Alan Wiley.
</P>
<P>
"It's a good afternoon to get three points. Here it's very hard."
</P>
<P>
Cahill hadn't played since March because of a broken foot and
missed the start of the new season as well as Australia's opening
World Cup qualifier in Uzbekistan in midweek.
</P>
<P>
The 28-year-old scored 10 league goals last season and played a
crucial role in helping Everton to fifth place in the table and a
spot in the UEFA Cup.
</P>
<P>
This victory took the Toffees into the top half of the Premier
League but left Stoke with only basement club Tottenham, who play
Aston Villa on Monday, below them in the table.
</P>
<P>
Goals either side of half-time from Nigerian internationals
Yakubu and Victor Anichebe put the visitors ahead and seemingly
in control.
</P>
<P>
But Stoke got back into the game soon after the visitors' second
with a goal from another Nigerian, Seyi Olofinjana, before Mark
Jagielka put through his own net in the 63rd minute.
</P>
<P>
Both teams had cause to rue a couple of controversial decisions
by Wiley.
</P>
<P>
First Stoke were denied a seemingly good goal when Ricardo
Fuller, after rounding Tim Howard in the 59th minute and slotting
the ball into the net, was penalised for making contact on Joseph
Yobo.
</P>
<P>
Everton were as incensed when Wiley, who had pointed to the
penalty spot, changed his mind after consulting his linesman and
instead gave a free-kick on the edge of the box, when it appeared
Stoke's Leon Cort had handled inside the penalty area.
</P>
<P>
Soon afterwards a furious Moyes, having berated the fourth
official, was sent to the stands.
</P>
<P>
"The referee pointed to the spot and from where I was standing he
(Cort) was two yards inside (the box)," said Moyes.
</P>
<P>
"I've not had a chance to see it yet. If I'm wrong, I'll
apologise to him. I would probably expect the same from him
(Wiley)," the Scot added.
</P>
<P>
A match that had been full of endeavour, with Stoke's aerial
threat a persistent problem for the Everton defence, received a
much-needed injection of class in the 41st minute.
</P>
<P>
Arteta's clever reverse-pass found Cahill and his precise ball
released Yakubu who calmly slotted home past City goalkeeper
Thomas Sorensen.
</P>
<P>
Neither side looked comfortable when defending set-pieces and
Everton doubled their lead in the 51st minute when the unmarked
Anichebe's glancing header from Arteta's free-kick gave Sorensen
no chance.
</P>
<P>
Stoke, however, fought back after Everton failed to deal with two
long throws. First Everton keeper Tim Howard could only punch
weakly as he came to deal with Rory Delap's throw and Olofinjana
volleyed the ball back fiercely past the American.
</P>
<P>
Another Delap delivery caused problems when Jagielka headed past
Howard at the near post and Stoke were level.
</P>
<P>
But just when Tony Pulis's side thought they might be on course
for a memorable victory, Cahill headed in from eight yards.
