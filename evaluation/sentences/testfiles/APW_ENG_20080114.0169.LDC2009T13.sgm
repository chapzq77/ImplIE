India's prime minister addressed a business conference Monday in
China's capital at the start of a state visit highlighting
deepening interaction between the Asian giants whose juggernaut
economies are increasingly driving world trade.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's three-day visit to China, the
first by an Indian prime minister in five years, seeks to inject
new vitality into the sometimes strained relationship between the
two nations, whose combined population of nearly 2.4 billion
accounts for one-third of humanity.
</P>
<P>
Singh was due to meet with Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao later
Monday following a formal welcoming ceremony at the Great Hall of
the People, the hulking seat of the national legislature beside
Tiananmen Square in central Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Singh has presided over an unprecedented expansion in contacts
between India and China since taking office in 2004, with
bilateral trade surging to US$37 billion (euro25.04 billion) last
year. Direct flights have fueled growing numbers of visitors
between the two countries, and their militaries late last year
staged joint drills for the first time.
</P>
<P>
The growing links come despite lingering suspicions dating from a
short but bloody border war fought by the two in 1962 and the
still-unresolved boundary dispute.
</P>
<P>
India, meanwhile, has expressed concern about China's cultivation
of relations with Myanmar, Pakistan and other Indian neighbors,
while Beijing is believed to be watching developments in New
Delhi's increasingly close relationship with Washington.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, Singh was also due to meet President Hu Jintao
and the Communist Party's No. 2 ranking official, Wu Bangguo. He
planned to address a government think tank and co-preside over a
ceremony marking the founding of a joint medical team.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Singh met with members of the Indian business
community, who complained about China's US$9 billion (euro6
billion) trade surplus with India and a lack of investment
opportunities for Indian businesses in China, according to the
The Times of India daily.
