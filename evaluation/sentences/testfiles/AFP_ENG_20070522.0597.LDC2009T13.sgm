Kerkorian makes new play for Las Vegas casinos
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Billionaire investor Kirk Kerkorian has made a new play in Las
Vegas, bidding through his personal holding company for a big MGM
Mirage casino and mixed-use development in the US gaming capital.
</P>
<P>
Kerkorian, through his private investment company, Tracinda
Corp., already owns 56.3 percent of the MGM Mirage conglomerate
whose portfolio includes some of the biggest properties on the
Las Vegas Strip, including Bellagio, MGM Grand and Luxor.
</P>
<P>
But in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission late
Monday, Tracinda said it wanted to buy the Bellagio along with
MGM Mirage's CityCenter, a multibillion-dollar complex of hotels,
a resort casino-hotel, private residences and a shopping center
being built near the Bellagio.
</P>
<P>
The reasons were not immediately clear why Kerkorian wanted to
move those assets from MGM to his personal holding company.
</P>
<P>
But Tracinda said in the filing "it also wishes to pursue
strategic alternatives with respect to its investment in MGM
Mirage which may include financial restructuring transactions
involving all or a substantial portion of the remainder of the
company."
</P>
<P>
Shares in MGM Mirage hit the jackpot Tuesday, climbing 27 percent
to 79.95 dollars in early afternoon trade, easing back from an
intraday high of 82.25 dollars.
</P>
<P>
MGM, whose shareholders hold their annual meeting Tuesday, said
it would study the offer and respond "in due course."
</P>
<P>
Several analysts point out the potential benefits of the Tracinda
proposal, which would refocus MGM Mirage around its core gaming
business.
</P>
<P>
Calyon, a corporate and investment bank, estimated the value of
the combined Bellagio and CityCenter properties at 11.5-12.0
billion dollars -- 6.0 billion for the casino-hotel and 5.5
billion for the urban complex.
</P>
<P>
MGM Mirage said last month it had revised upward the estimated
cost of construction of the CityCenter project to 7.4 billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
MGM Mirage could decide to keep a minority stake in the Bellagio-
City Center duo and thus share its profits. Calyon raised its
share price estimate for MGM Mirage to 85-90 dollars.
</P>
<P>
If Kerkorian succeeds, the Bank of America said, the
restructuring of MGM Mirage "could push valuation even higher
than their 80-dollar target" to a share price around 85-95
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Analysts at brokerage Susquehanna said the development "raises
the specter of another wave of privatization transactions in the
gaming space."
