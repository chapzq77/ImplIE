Greek students demand return of Parthenon Marbles
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thousands of Greek schoolchildren demonstrated Tuesday at the
Acropolis to demand that foreign museums return "pillaged"
fragments of the Parthenon, the 2,500-year-old temple to the
Greek capital's patron goddess Athena.
</P>
<P>
Clad in orange jackets stamped with the logo "Reunification Now",
the pupils formed a human chain along one of Athens' main tourist
walkways in a protest mainly aimed at the British Museum in
London.
</P>
<P>
"The Acropolis and the Parthenon Marbles are our pride and
dignity...we are requesting them (back)" organisers of the
initiative said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"The symbol of our democracy and our culture (has lain) brutally
mutilated and pillaged for two centuries," they said.
</P>
<P>
Fragments of the Parthenon, including sculpted friezes depicting
gods, men and monsters, were removed from the temple in the early
19th century at a time when modern-day Greece was part of the
Ottoman Empire.
</P>
<P>
According to the Greek culture ministry, pieces of the 5th-
century B.C. temple are currently found in London, Paris, Vienna,
Rome, Palermo, Copenhagen, Munich and Wuerzburg.
</P>
<P>
The most impressive collection was taken to London by agents of
British ambassador Lord Elgin in 1806-11, and is currently housed
in the British Museum.
</P>
<P>
The Greeks have for 20 years demanded the fragments' return,
complaining that the works -- masterpieces executed at the height
of the Greek classical period -- were illegally removed and are
part of the national heritage.
</P>
<P>
A new museum purpose-built to house the Marbles is scheduled to
be inaugurated this year near the Acropolis, the ancient citadel
overlooking Athens.
