US proposes common missile defense network with Russia, NATO
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The United States on Friday proposed a common network of missile
defense systems with Russia and NATO to allay Moscow's concerns
over a planned US missile defence system in central Europe.
</P>
<P>
"The answer is we and the Russians and NATO or the NATO-Russia
Council work together to produce a common system or common
network of systems which would benefit everyone's security and
also address Russian security concerns," Assistant Secretary of
State Daniel Fried said.
</P>
<P>
"If they are part of the system, they can be much more confident
that it is not directed against them," he said, speaking ahead of
talks next week between US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice
and Defense Secretary Robert Gates with their opposite numbers in
Moscow on October 12.
</P>
<P>
They will meet Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Defense
Secretary Anatoly Serdyukov in the wake of stalled negotiations
earlier this month between the two sides in Paris on America's
planned missile defense system.
</P>
<P>
The proposed system in central Europe is a source of long-running
friction between the two former Cold War enemies.
</P>
<P>
Washington claims the system would protect against "rogue states"
such as Iran and wants to build a radar tracking base in the
Czech Republic and house interceptor missiles in Poland.
</P>
<P>
Moscow has said the system would create a "new Berlin wall," and
President Vladimir Putin has suggested siting it in Azerbaijan
instead.
</P>
<P>
Kremlin also threatened to re-deploy nuclear missiles if the US
forges ahead with the project.
</P>
<P>
Fried, who is in charge of for European and Eurasian Affairs in
the State Department, said Russian plans to share the Gabar radar
station in Azerbaijan or a radar site in southern Russia opened
up a possibility of having "genuinely collaborative efforts on
missile defense directed at common problems.
</P>
<P>
"We would like to see the whole question opened up as it were
with everything on the table -- what NATO is doing, what US,
Poles and Czechs may be doing, what Russia is prepared to offer.
</P>
<P>
"So, this is a very far reaching proposal by the Russians which I
hope would have some very good potential areas of cooperation,"
he said.
