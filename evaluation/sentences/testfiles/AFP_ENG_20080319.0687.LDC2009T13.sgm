Last odyssey for sci-fi guru Arthur C. Clarke
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Science fiction author Arthur C. Clarke, who died Wednesday aged
90, captured the world's imagination with his vision of the
future in books such as "2001: A Space Odyssey" and predicted
communication satellites.
</P>
<P>
Born in Britain, Clarke had lived in Sri Lanka for more than half
a century, holed up in an "electronic cottage" from which he
communicated with the world via a battery of monitors, radios and
computer keyboards.
</P>
<P>
Clarke was knighted by Britain's Queen Elizabeth in 1998 in
recognition of his status as the grand old man of science
fiction.
</P>
<P>
After a diverse career as a writer, underwater explorer, space
promoter and science populariser, Clarke said he would like to be
remembered primarily as a writer and wished for peace in his
adopted home Sri Lanka where had lived since 1956.
</P>
<P>
"I want to be remembered most as a writer -- one who entertained
readers, and, hopefully, stretched their imagination as well,"
Clarke said in December.
</P>
<P>
Just a few days before he died, Clarke reviewed the final
manuscript of his latest novel, "The Last Theorem" co-written
with American author Frederik Pohl, which is to be published
later this year.
</P>
<P>
"The Last Theorem has taken a lot longer than I expected. That
could well be my last novel, but then I've said that before,"
Clarke said last year.
</P>
<P>
Clarke wanted to be allowed three wishes. As well as peace in Sri
Lanka, he hoped for evidence of extra-terrestrial life and for
the world to adopt cleaner fuels.
</P>
<P>
"I have no regrets and no more personal ambitions," he said at
his 90th birthday even as he was confined to a wheelchair over
the past three decades because of the effects of childhood polio.
</P>
<P>
Though indissociably linked with the filmmaker Stanley Kubrick,
with whom he wrote the novel and screenplay of the cult classic
"2001: A Space Odyssey", Clarke first made his mark with a
visionary paper written during World War II in which he worked
out the conditions for placing geostationary satellites in orbit.
</P>
<P>
He was paid 15 pounds for a theory that launched an industry than
can now be measured in billions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
"People say I could have made a lot of money if I applied for a
patent," Clarke said. "I did not get a patent because I never
thought it will happen in my life time."
</P>
<P>
Born to farming parents on December 16, 1917 at Minehead in the
west of England (he retained his Somerset burr to the end of his
life), Clarke was only 12 when he developed an interest in
science fiction after reading the March 1930 issue of the US sci-
fi magazine Amazing Stories.
</P>
<P>
He became an early member of the British Interplanetary Society,
a group of dreamers who met to discuss ways of putting a man on
the moon, performed war service as an RAF lieutenant working in
radar, and acquired a postwar physics and maths degree from
King's College, London. And in 1950 began writing books.
</P>
<P>
His first efforts were non-fiction, involving early descriptions
of space flight. But in 1953 he received rave reviews for
"Childhood's End", his fifth science-fiction novel, and was freed
financially pursue his other love, and the subject of a dozen of
his later books, underwater exploration.
</P>
<P>
That brought him to Sri Lanka (then Ceylon) where he settled
(though remaining a British citizen) in the 1950s, setting up a
diving school at Hikkaduwa, down the coast from Colombo.
</P>
<P>
He also spent several months a year living in New York, and it
was there that he met Kubrick, who was keen on making a science-
fiction movie. The idea for "2001" was born of a meeting in
Trader Vic's bar, the filmmaker requiring  Clarke to write out a
full-length novel before they worked on a script.
</P>
<P>
The film met mixed critical reviews initially, but soon
established itself as a classic of the genre. Clarke himself
regarded it as one of the three great achievements of his life,
along with the satellite paper and the lead he gave for the
television series "Star Trek".
</P>
<P>
Despite his specialist knowledge and visionary status, Clarke had
an uneasy relationship with the scientific establishment, and
many of his technical papers were published in Playboy magazine.
</P>
<P>
Among the "extrapolations" he made for the future (he avoided the
word predictions), Clarke envisaged mankind making contact with
intelligent life on other planets by 2030 and discovering the
secret of immortality by 2090 -- probably "electronic
immortality, with all sorts of good results, and some bad
results."
</P>
<P>
Keeping up a punishing work routine into his eighties, Clarke
wrote three sequels to "2001", the last in 1997, entitled "3001:
The Final Odyssey".
</P>
<P>
Living in Sri Lanka as a "failed recluse", he was granted unique
tax-free status after he persuaded the authorities to enact the
Resident Guest Scheme (popularly known as "the Arthur Clarke
law") permitting prominent foreigners who bring in hard currency
to enjoy minimal taxes and a variety of perks.
</P>
<P>
"He is a national asset for Sri Lanka," President Mahinda
Rajapakse said at Clarke's 90th birthday bash in Colombo.
</P>
<P>
Clarke enjoyed the company of the famous, and his home was lined
with photographs of his meetings with the late Pope John Paul II,
or with astronaut Neil Armstrong, or with Prince Charles who
travelled to Colombo to confer his knighthood on him.
</P>
<P>
The ceremony was postponed amid unsubstantiated allegations of
paedophilia in the British media based on unguarded remarks
Clarke made to two visiting journalists. Clarke vigorously
rejected the allegations.
</P>
<P>
In 1953, Clarke married Marilyn Mayfield, an American divorcee,
but separated six months later.
