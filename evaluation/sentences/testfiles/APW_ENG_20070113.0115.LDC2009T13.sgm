COCHABAMBA, Bolivia 2007-01-13 01:19:19 UTC
</P>
<P>
Backers of President Evo Morales have lifted a blockade of the
highways around the central Bolivian city of Cochabamba but vowed
to continue a vigil calling for the resignation of a state
governor critical of the populist leader.
</P>
<P>
Protesters carrying sticks, torn tree branches, pipes and chains
roamed the city streets again on Friday, a day after clashes
between groups for and against embattled Cochabamba state
governor Manfred Reyes Villa left two dead and more than a 130
wounded.
</P>
<P>
But Friday saw only relatively minor clashes with the hundreds of
police and soldiers deployed throughout the valley city 200
kilometers (125 miles) southeast of La Paz. A crowd of youths
briefly tried to attack the offices of a television network
sympathetic to Bolivia's conservative opposition but were driven
back by tear gas.
</P>
<P>
Several thousand demonstrators remain in the tree-filled plaza in
front of the state capital building, and say they will stay there
so as long as Reyes is in office.
</P>
<P>
Protest leaders said they want to avoid another deadly clash with
the governor's supporters.
</P>
<P>
"We will not give them the provocation," Omar Fernandez, head of
a Cochabamba labor union which helped organize the protests, told
The Associated Press. "We will continue our vigil here, and we
will continue until Manfred Reyes Villa resigns."
</P>
<P>
Fernandez said that the protester organizers were preparing to
name their own Cochabamba state governor.
</P>
<P>
In a series of marches over the last month both city dwellers and
coca farmers from the surrounding countryside have marched on the
capital to denounced Reyes' support for greater state autonomy
from Morales' government.
</P>
<P>
Reyes has also criticized Morales' attempts to control an
assembly rewriting the country's constitution -- a position
unpopular with many in Morales' home state.
</P>
<P>
Reyes has said he won't resign and blamed Morales for not
reacting more forcefully to protests earlier in the week.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of coca growers -- many members of Bolivia's largest
coca growers' union, of which Morales still serves as president
-- have gone to the capital from the countryside to call for his
resignation.
</P>
<P>
Morales, speaking Friday after returning from the inauguration of
fellow leftist President Daniel Ortega in Nicaragua, blamed Reyes
for provoking the protests but called on demonstrators to refrain
from further violence.
</P>
<P>
"We all want unity and integrity, and the governor of
Cochabamba's support for independence has caused a reaction in
patriotic people from both the city and the countryside," he
said.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday several thousand rival demonstrators beat each other
with sticks in Cochabamba's picturesque plazas, images that were
broadcast on national television. Three demonstrators were
arrested for carrying handguns, according to government
authorities.
</P>
<P>
The battle took place on a day when Reyes, a former presidential
candidate widely considered to still harbor national ambitions,
had traveled to the Bolivian capital La Paz to meet with four
other governors on a political strategy opposing Morales.
</P>
<P>
Opposition leaders also criticized Morales for not returning
immediately from Nicaragua.
</P>
<P>
"The president was with foreigner instead of being here in
Bolivia facing the situation," said Jorge Quiroga, leader of the
conservative opposition party Podemos. He called for the Roman
Catholic Church to mediate the conflict and "starting with peace
in Cochabamba so that we can reconciliation throughout the
country."
</P>
<P>
Quiroga has called the protests by government supporters a
"danger to democracy."
</P>
<P>
Morales' efforts to expand his executive power have incensed the
opposition governors who head six of nine Bolivian states, many
of which have long sought greater autonomy from the central
government.
</P>
<P>
Tensions between Morales and opposition governors have heightened
in recent weeks, with Morales proposing to sending deputies from
La Paz to monitor the state governments' activities. Opposition
governors immediately threatened to send their own delegations to
keep a closer eye on Morales.
</P>
<P>
Reyes has called for Cochabamba to hold a second vote on a
referendum giving the states greater power.
</P>
<P>
The referendum was defeated in a nationwide election in July,
with 63 percent of Cochabamba voters opposed to autonomy.
