Authorities worried about firefighters' safety pulled them away
from a fast-growing wildfire in western Montana, and told
residents of some 200 homes to get out of the way.

"This fire is in the hands of God right now," Governor Brian
Schweitzer said Saturday after taking a helicopter flight over
the blaze, which already had burned nearly 8 square miles (20.7
sq. kilometers) since starting Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Schweitzer said the wind-whipped fire was volatile and could grow
rapidly, jeopardizing crews.
</P>
<P>
There were no reports of homes burning, said Jamie Kirby, a fire
information officer. It was not known how close the fire was to
the houses, a mix of year-round and vacation homes.

Montana has seen dozens of fires in a wildfire season that began
earlier than usual in the U.S. West. Major fires included one
north of Helena that was last measured at about 58 square miles
(150.2 sq. kilometers), and was projected to grow Saturday with
the help of winds.

Northwest of Los Angeles, meanwhile, fire crews braced for
another possible flare-up by a month-old forest fire that has
forced hundreds of people to flee rural cabins.
</P>
<P>
"It's not good. We expect it to run again," fire spokesman Pete
Nicklin said.
</P>
<P>
The fire in Los Padres National Forest had charred an estimated
70 square miles (181.3 sq. kilometers) by Saturday and was 60
percent contained, little changed from Friday, fire officials
said.
