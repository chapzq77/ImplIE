Anger mounts over Brazil's deadliest air crash
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rescuers on Thursday pulled charred bodies from the burned out
wreckage of Brazil's deadliest air disaster, amid angry
accusations that airport safety concerns had been ignored.
</P>
<P>
All 186 passengers and crew aboard the Airbus 320 were believed
to have died in Tuesday's crash at Sao Paulo's Cagonhas airport,
along with a number of people on the ground.
</P>
<P>
The Tam Airlines flight had careened off the slick runway upon
landing in driving rain, skidded across a crowded avenue and
slammed into a warehouse where it exploded in a fireball.
</P>
<P>
It was "a tragedy waiting to happen," said Cezar Britto,
president of The Order of Lawyers of Brazil, echoing opposition
and national media criticism of precarious conditions at the
airport.
</P>
<P>
"What exploded in Cagonhas was not just the TAM airbus and almost
200 victims but the credibility of the Brazilian aviation
system," Britto said.
</P>
<P>
Cagonhas is notorious for a runway some officials consider too
short and which pilots say becomes slick when wet.
</P>
<P>
"The runway was as slippery as soap," an unnamed pilot told the O
Globo daily, adding that authorities should not have allowed the
plane to land at in such conditions.
</P>
<P>
By the early morning hours of Wednesday, rescuers said they had
pulled 181 bodies from the twisted metal of the plane and
surrounding warehouse rubble. Three of the bodies were found
inside the Tam Express building that was struck by the plane.
</P>
<P>
One of the aircraft's black boxes was recovered.
</P>
<P>
Five people were still listed as missing and eleven people were
in hospital with injuries, four of them in a critical state, the
rescuers said.
</P>
<P>
"There is no sign of survivors," TAM President Marco Antonio
Bologna said at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
There have been a number of incidents of planes skidding off the
tarmac at the airport, including one the day before Tuesday's
crash.
</P>
<P>
The main runway had been resurfaced last month, but more work was
scheduled for September to build grooves into the surface to
allow for better water drainage.
</P>
<P>
"Control tower operators had warned the runway should be closed
because it didn't have 'grooving,' but no one in the government
wanted to hear about it," said Sergio Olivera, who heads the
Federation of Air Controllers.
</P>
<P>
The Justice Ministry said it had ordered an investigation to
establish whether the runway met technical and legal security
standards.
</P>
<P>
Brazil's airway infrastructure came under fresh scrutiny after
the September crash of a Gol airliner with 154 people on board in
the Amazon jungle. The plane had collided with a small jet in an
incident blamed on a deficient air traffic control system.
</P>
<P>
President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva declared three days of
national mourning as world leaders conveyed their condolences
over Tuesday's crash.
</P>
<P>
The victims included two French nationals, an Argentine and a
Peruvian.
</P>
<P>
Pope Benedict XVI expressed his sorrow, saying he prayed "for
strength and comfort for the injured and for those affected by
the tragedy."
</P>
<P>
France's Bureau of Investigation and Analysis (BEA) said it was
sending two of its investigators and that its German counterpart,
the BFU, was sending another two. Five Airbus experts also were
on their way.
</P>
<P>
Located just a few kilometers from Sao Paulo's city center,
Congonhas is Latin America's busiest airport, with an average of
630 daily landings and take-offs. It is mainly used for flights
from other parts of Brazil and South America.
</P>
<P>
In February, a local judge banned the use of the airport by
Fokker 100, Boeing 737-800 and Boeing 737/700 jetliners, but the
ruling was overturned by an appeals court.
</P>
<P>
TAM's president declined to give an opinion on the runway's
condition, saying he would await the outcome of investigations
"to know what was the real cause of the accident."
