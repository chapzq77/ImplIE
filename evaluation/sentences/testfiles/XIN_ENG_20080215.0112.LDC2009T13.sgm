"unlikely contaminated in transport"

SHIJIAZHUANG, Feb. 15 (Xinhua)
</P>
<P>
The director of Hebei Province's quality inspection agency told
reporters here on Friday that the two batches of dumplings
involved in food poisoning case in Japan were unlikely to have
been contaminated during the transportation process in China.
</P>
<P>
Investigations had shown that the dumplings were kept in the
shipping container after they left the manufacturer, Tianyang
Food Plant, and the inspection and quarantine authority of Hebei
Province made sure that the door and seal of the container were
intact when the shipment arrived at the customs facility, said
director Cheng Fang.
</P>
<P>
The customs officials followed the rules, checked the
documentation for the goods and let the container through without
opening it, the official told a press conference.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Japanese and Chinese investigators inspected
the company but found nothing irregular. They also found no
problems related to the purchase of raw materials or the
production process.
</P>
<P>
"The plant is very clean and well-managed, and no abnormality has
been detected," a Japanese investigator told the press after the
inspection. He said Japan would conduct a further analysis based
on data collected in the plant.
</P>
<P>
Di Menglu, head of Tianyang, said that there was little
possibility of contamination during production. Workers had to
wear work clothes that covered them from head to toe and pass
through two checkpoints before they could enter the production
area, to ensure that they brought nothing in.
</P>
<P>
Cameras monitored the entire production line, and the large
number of workers grouped in close conditions would make it
difficult to do anything without detection, he said.
</P>
<P>
Production at the 800-worker factory had been suspended since the
incident, and the recalled dumplings were kept in the cold
storage, with seals from the inspection authority, he said. "We
suffered severe losses."
</P>
<P>
"With no work to do, we had to stay at home, waiting for the
solution," said Yan Aiguo, a worker.
</P>
<P>
Tianyang Food Plant has been exporting to Japan for 10 years, and
it sent 3,970 tonnes of dumplings to Japan last year.
</P>
<P>
Di quoted an announcement from the Japanese Ministry of Education
dated Feb. 6, which said that other schools serving dumplings
from the same batches did not report any poisoning cases.
</P>
<P>
Earlier tests showed the rest of the dumplings from the same
batches sold in Japan, totaling more than 2,000 packages, were
safe. So were all the other products made by the Chinese company.
</P>
<P>
A Japanese local government official admitted on Thursday that a
pesticide detected recently on the outside of the packaging of
some Chinese-made dumplings was dichlorvos, which had been used
in the store.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference, Tokushima Prefecture Governor Kamon Iizumi
said that dichlorvos had also been detected on frozen food made
in Japan and showcases at the store, but the amount had been too
small to cause any injury, Kyodo News reported.
</P>
<P>
The governor denied any relationship between the incident and
recent unsolved poisoning cases involving Chinese-made dumplings
sold in Japan.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that the case in Tokushima indicated the
possibility that food products might be contaminated during the
distribution and retail process in Japan.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese health ministry issued a notice in 2004 forbidding
the placement of pesticide in areas for foods.
