KABUL, Afghanistan 2007-07-26 06:36:54 UTC
</P>
<P>
A top envoy from South Korea headed to Afghanistan on Thursday,
scrambling to save 22 South Koreans held captive by Taliban
kidnappers after the militants killed one hostage.
</P>
<P>
An Afghan police chief ruled out using force to free the
remaining captive and said that Afghan negotiators were speaking
with the Taliban over the phone, hoping to secure their release.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, authorities found the bullet-riddled body of 42
-year-old Bae Hyung-kyu in Qarabagh district of Ghazni province
where the South Koreans were abducted July 19.
</P>
<P>
The victim was found with 10 bullet holes in his head, chest and
stomach, said Abdul Rahman, a police officer. Another Afghan
police official, who asked not to be identified because of the
sensitivity of the situation, said militants told him the hostage
was sick and couldn't walk and was therefore shot.
</P>
<P>
The kidnappers "will be held accountable for taking the life of a
Korean citizen," Baek Jong-chun, South Korea's chief presidential
secretary for security affairs, said in a statement, before
departing for Afghanistan to consult with top Afghan officials on
how to secure the release of the remaining captives.
</P>
<P>
After conflicting reports Wednesday from Western and Afghan
officials that possibly eight of the other hostages had been
released, South Korean presidential spokesman Chun Ho-sun said
the 22 were still believed held but not suffering from health
problems.
</P>
<P>
Chun said South Korean President Roh Moo-hyun had spoken with his
Afghan counterpart Hamid Karzai, but did not disclose the
contents of their discussion.
</P>
<P>
Ghazni police chief Ali Shah Ahmadzai said that the Afghan
negotiators were speaking with the Taliban over the phone, in a
hope of securing the hostages release.
</P>
<P>
"We will not use force against the militants to free the
hostages," he said. "The best way in this case is dialogue."
</P>
<P>
"We are hopeful that by noon today we will reach some sort of
deal for the release of six up to eight people," Ahmadzai said,
without giving more explanation for his optimism.
</P>
<P>
Chun said that both governments were cooperating and that an
Afghan official had told South Korea earlier Thursday that Kabul
intended to negotiate with the Taliban. He said Seoul was aware
of the Taliban's current demands but declined to specify them.
</P>
<P>
Seoul also repeated its call that no rescue mission be launched
that could endanger the captives further.
</P>
<P>
"We oppose military operations and there won't be military
operations that we do not consent to," Chun said.
</P>
<P>
Marajudin Pathan, the governor of Ghazni province, said militants
have given a list of eight Taliban prisoners who they want
released in exchange for eight Koreans.
</P>
<P>
An Afghan official involved in the negotiations earlier said a
large sum of money would be paid to free eight of the hostages.
The official also spoke on condition he not be identified, citing
the matter's sensitivity. No other officials would confirm this
account.
</P>
<P>
Foreign governments are suspected to have paid for the release of
hostages in Afghanistan in the past, but have either kept it
quiet or denied it outright. The Taliban at one point demanded
that 23 jailed militants be freed in exchange for the Koreans.
</P>
<P>
The South Koreans, including 18 women, were kidnapped while on a
bus trip through Ghazni province on the Kabul-Kandahar highway,
Afghanistan's main thoroughfare.
</P>
<P>
South Korea has banned its citizens from traveling to Afghanistan
in the wake of the kidnappings. Seoul also asked Kabul not to
issue visas to South Koreans and to block their entry into the
country.
</P>
<P>
Because of a recent spike in kidnappings of foreigners --
including an attempt against a Danish citizen Wednesday -- Afghan
police announced that foreigners were no longer allowed to leave
the Afghan capital without their permission.
</P>
<P>
The South Korean church that the abductees attend has said it
will suspend at least some of its volunteer work in Afghanistan.
It also stressed that the Koreans abducted were not involved in
any Christian missionary work, saying they provided only medical
and other volunteer aid to distressed people in the war-ravaged
country.
</P>
<P>
Two Germans were also kidnapped last week. One was found dead and
the other apparently remains captive. A Danish reporter of Afghan
origin escaped a kidnap attempt in eastern Afghanistan on
Wednesday, the Danish Foreign Ministry said.
