CARDIFF, Wales 2007-09-13 15:00:34 UTC

Stephen Jones swung the opening match in Wales' favor and the
selection balance in favor of experience for Saturday's crucial
World Cup Group B encounter against Australia.
</P>
<P>
Wales coach Gareth Jenkins recalled three veterans with more than
250 caps between them on Thursday for the Millennium Stadium
clash against the two-time champion Australians.
</P>
<P>
The 29-year-old Jones replaced 22-year-old James Hook at flyhalf
in the most hotly contested position, with veteran backrower
Colin Charvis winning a recall and Gareth Thomas returning at
fullback and captain.
</P>
<P>
The trio, with a combined 251 test caps, all came off the bench
in the 42-17 win over Canada. Jones was crucial in sparking the
attack which crossed for five unanswered tries after Wales
slipped behind 17-9 in the second half.
</P>
<P>
Adam Jones was also included at prop to add some weight to the
scrum, where the Welsh hope to dominate the Wallabies.
</P>
<P>
With the winner in Cardiff expected to top the group, and avoid
an expected quarterfinal against South Africa, Jenkins did not
want to gamble.
</P>
<P>
"We have brought in three players who showed last weekend what
experienced heads can do to a performance," he said. "They picked
up the game against Canada and were able to fashion a victory for
us.
</P>
<P>
"Our team is evolving at the right time and we are very much
looking forward to the challenge this weekend."
</P>
<P>
Jenkins has never overseen such an important match. He said
recent results, including Wales' two losses in Australia earlier
this year and its win and draw against the Wallabies in the last
two matches at Cardiff were of no consequence to the upcoming
clash.
</P>
<P>
"This is a significant match for us in many ways. It's the most
important match a Welsh side has played for a long time," Jenkins
said. "We have gone through practically every emotion possible in
our last four meetings with them.
</P>
<P>
"But World Cup rugby pays no respect to history or to emotion. We
have a considered and professional approach and we have selected
a team to win this test match."
