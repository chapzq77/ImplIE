Musicians lift strike threat at Italy's La Scala opera
</HEADLINE>

Musicians at Milan's La Scala opera house called off a strike
that would have disrupted the season's opening performances after
reaching an agreement with management on their pay, an official
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"An agreement was found yesterday (Monday) evening," a
spokeswoman told AFP, adding that three performances of Verdi's
"Don Carlo" were "therefore confirmed."
</P>
<P>
The season is due to open, as tradition dictates, on Sunday,
which is Saint Ambroses's Day honouring Milan's patron saint.
</P>
<P>
The threat strike was made by Fials, the trade union representing
most of the theatre's musicians and other employees, including
musicians, who objected to an agreement signed by La Scala
management and three other unions in July.
</P>
<P>
The protesting employees had said a benefits and wages package
for 2008 to 2011 worth 11.5 million euros (14.8 million dollars)
was not enough.
</P>
<P>
Fials signed on to the agreement after several modifications, the
opera house's spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
The union had wanted employees to go on strike during the first
three shows of the season, including Sunday's gala opener, a 42
-year-old tradition.
