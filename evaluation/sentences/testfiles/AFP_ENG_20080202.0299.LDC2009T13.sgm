Putin favourite joins war veterans as campaign period starts
</HEADLINE>

<P>
President Vladimir Putin's favoured successor, Dmitry Medvedev,
joined World War II commemorations on Saturday as part of a
profile-raising tour a month ahead of March 2 polls.
</P>
<P>
Medvedev laid a wreath at an "eternal flame" that burns in honour
of those who died at the Battle of Stalingrad, a turning point in
the Soviet Union's monumental struggle against Nazi Germany in
World War II, state television showed.
</P>
<P>
The occasion, attended by thousands of veterans in the southern
Russian city now named Volgograd, came during a highly publicised
country-wide tour by Medvedev, officially conducted in his
capacity as first deputy prime minister.
</P>
<P>
"The exploits of Stalingrad are written in gold letters in the
history of our fatherland. We must do all we can to ensure their
memory lives on and to protect this monument," he was quoted by
Interfax as saying at a vast memorial complex.
</P>
<P>
The visit by Medvedev, who is a protege of Putin's and at 42 a
child of the 1960s, coincided with the formal start of
campaigning in the state media one month ahead of the
presidential election.
</P>
<P>
In reality there was almost no sign of what promises to be a
tepid official campaign period.
</P>
<P>
State television was to begin its campaign broadcasts and debates
on the first working day of the campaign period on Monday, an
election commission spokeswoman told AFP.
</P>
<P>
Medvedev has opted not to participate in televised debates, yet
as Putin's favoured candidate is expected by analysts to receive
blanket coverage of his every move.
</P>
<P>
In the only sign of the official campaign, the state newspaper
Rossiyskaya Gazeta carried the programme of Medvedev's United
Russia party in eight closely typed columns, concluding: "We
consider ourselves continuers of the patriotic tradition of the
whole of Russia's 1,000-year statehood."
</P>
<P>
On Friday Putin was at Medvedev's side on a visit to the southern
town of Novocherkassk.
</P>
<P>
"An innovative economy is impossible without investment in
people, that is, in education and health care," Putin told
regional leaders.
</P>
<P>
Having served two consecutive terms as president, Putin is
obliged to step down in May under the terms of the constitution.
</P>
<P>
But he is expected to retain major power thanks to his protege
and has said he will take up the post of prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Critics such as the Other Russia movement of ex-chess champion
Garry Kasparov accuse the Kremlin of skewing the race by using
electoral law to remove serious opponents while ensuring Medvedev
disproportionate coverage.
</P>
<P>
The other three candidates are the ultra-nationalist leader of
the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia, Vladimir Zhirinovsky,
Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov and Democratic Party
leader Andrei Bogdanov.
</P>
<P>
Zyuganov and Zhirinovsky, though sometimes critical of the powers
that be, have a record of loyalty in parliamentary votes.
Bogdanov, a self-declared liberal, is a virtually unknown
newcomer to public life.
