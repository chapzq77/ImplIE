Japanese baseball great Sadaharu Oh will step down as manager of
the Softbank Hawks at the end of the 2008 season.
</P>
<P>
The 68-year-old Oh, who hit a record 868 home runs over 22
seasons when he played for the Yomiuri Giants, cited health
concerns Tuesday as his reason for leaving the team.
</P>
<P>
"I want to thank everyone for their support over the years," Oh
said. "I think it is best for the team if changes are made."
</P>
<P>
Oh was sidelined for the second half of the 2006 season due to
stomach cancer. He had his stomach removed in a successful
operation in July 2006.
</P>
<P>
Despite being picked by many to finish first, the Hawks have
struggled this season with a 61-71 record with three ties, and
are currently fifth in the six-team Pacific League standings.
</P>
<P>
Oh led Japan to the title at the inaugural World Baseball Classic
in 2006. He also guided the Hawks to the Japan Series title in
1999 and 2003, and served as Yomiuri Giants manager for five
years from 1984.
