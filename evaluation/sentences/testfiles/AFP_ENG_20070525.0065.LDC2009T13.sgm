German consumer sentiment continues to rise
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
German consumers are increasingly optimistic, despite a steep
rise in sales tax at the start of the year, a poll of consumer
attitudes in the biggest eurozone economy showed on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The consumer sentiment index calculated each month by market
research group GfK was forecast to rise to 7.3 points in June
from 5.7 points in May, the think- tank said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"The consumer climate has maintained its significant upturn in
the early summer of this year," GfK said.
</P>
<P>
With the job market and incomes set to be in better shape than
last year, "we have upgraded our forecast for growth of private
consumption this year to 1.0 percent from our original figure of
0.5 percent," it said.
</P>
<P>
For its monthly survey, GfK quizzes about 2,000 consumers on
their views on the economic outlook, income expectations and
their propensity to buy.
</P>
<P>
The responses are then used to calculate an overall consumer
climate index and based on the current month's reading, the GfK
also provides a forecast as to where it expects the index to
stand the following month.
</P>
<P>
The survey found that consumers' propensity to buy rose by 2.4
points to minus 4.1 points in May in the third consecutive
monthly rise.
</P>
<P>
"The weak phase in propensity to buy caused by the VAT increase
is an end," GfK found. "Consequently, consumers will again be
more inclined to loosen their purse strings and make larger
purchases."
</P>
<P>
The government raised VAT value added, or sales, tax by three
full percentage points to 19 percent with effect from January 1,
in a move which critics said would stifle consumer spending.
</P>
<P>
The data so far indicate that there was indeed a dent in private
consumption but that it proved only transitory.
</P>
<P>
Households are more optimistic with regard to their future income
than they have been in six years, with that sub-index rising by
4.0 points to plus 33.6 points in May.
</P>
<P>
The economic expectations sub-index topped a new record high,
rising by 8.5 points to 69.5 points, GfK found.
