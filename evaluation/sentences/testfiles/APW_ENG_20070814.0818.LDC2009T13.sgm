Zap ' em? Burn ' em? Crush ' em? Spain takes a whack at rodent
plague

What's a country to do with a plague of crop-munching rodents?
</P>
<P>
Spain's Castille-Leon region has such an infestation. Ideas
abound on how to quell it: Burn them. Drown them. Squish them
with a rolling pin attached to a plow.
</P>
<P>
Then there's this high-tech solution from a government
veterinarian: Zap the mouse-like voles with ultrasound, using a
cross between the Pied Piper ploy and a military pincer movement
to herd them together for a collective death by either water or
fire.
</P>
<P>
The government of Castille-Leon, a northern region that is one of
Spain's agricultural heartlands, began burning already-harvested
farmland last week to try to wipe out an invasion that has become
a nightmare.
</P>
<P>
Jose Carlos Pinero, a veterinarian with the Castille-Leon
regional health department and proponent of the ultrasound idea,
said Tuesday that scientists believe there may be 700 million of
the pests. And they stink.
</P>
<P>
"The other day I was driving along the highway and the smell was
overpowering," he said from Valladolid, the regional capital.
</P>
<P>
Grains have been devastated. The voles are now turning to summer
crops like potatoes, grapes and beets.
</P>
<P>
The government says it is flummoxed as to what is causing the
infestation, although Pinero blames it on a mild winter --
freezing temperatures kill off many voles -- and an abundance of
spring rain that led to bountiful harvests and a rodent feast.
</P>
<P>
Everyone seems to have a different idea of what should be done.
</P>
<P>
Pablo Villar, mayor of Villalar de los Comuneros, population 500,
tied a huge iron tube to the back of a plow Tuesday. The idea was
to uncover the voles' hideouts, then crush them with the roller.
</P>
<P>
"The roller did not kill as many animals as we thought it would,"
he said in a telephone interview, adding he will try again with a
heavier roller. "I am simply not going to allow voles to live
here with me," he said.
</P>
<P>
From cyberspace, Internet contributors offer ideas like piping
exhaust fumes into vole holes, stuffing them with rags soaked
with gasoline, setting up little fences outside farmland, and
even electrifying them.
