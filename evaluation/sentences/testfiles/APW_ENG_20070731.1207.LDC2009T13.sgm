Study finds Florida optical scan voting machines still flawed

Florida's optical scan voting machines are still flawed, despite
efforts to fix them, and they could allow poll workers to tamper
with the election results, according to a government-ordered
study obtained Tuesday by The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
The state banned punch cards and replaced them with optical scan
and touch-screen voting machines after its voting system drew
national attention in 2000, when unclear ballots held up a final
count in the presidential election. The state was eventually
decided by 537 votes after the U.S. Supreme Court stepped in,
handing the election to the Repubilcan candidate, George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
But, optical scan machines have proven to have problems. At the
request of the secretary of state, Florida State University's
information technology laboratory went over a list of previously
discovered flaws on optical voting scan machines to see if they
are still vulnerable to attack.
</P>
<P>
"While the vendor has fixed many of these flaws, many important
vulnerabilities remain unaddressed," the report said.
</P>
<P>
The lab found, for example, that someone with only brief access
to the machines could replace a memory card with one preprogramed
to read one candidate's votes as counting for another,
essentially switching the candidates and showing the loser
winning.
</P>
<P>
"The attack can be carried out with a reasonably low probability
of detection assuming that audits with paper ballots are
infrequent," the report said.
</P>
<P>
Secretary of State Kurt Browning is asking Diebold Elections
Systems to address the problems.
</P>
<P>
Currently, 15 of Florida's 67 counties use paperless touch-screen
voting machines. The remaining counties use optical scan machines
where a voter marks a paper ballot with a pencil and it is
electronically scanned. A newly signed state law requires a
verifiable paper trail for all voting machines.
