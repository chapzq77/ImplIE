Candidates for the Holiday Shopping List
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A few months ago, no list of the upcoming fall season's most
anticipated video games would have been complete without "Grand
Theft Auto IV" -- but that was before the game was delayed until
next year.
</P>
<P>
So what's left for gamers? Plenty -- and we're not even including
"Halo 3," which doesn't make our cut because it's already in
stores. In fact, despite a sequel-heavy release slate for the
holiday season, only a couple such titles are included here.
</P>
<P>
These games look promising enough to deserve spots on your
holiday wish list:
</P>
<P>
"Mass Effect"
</P>
<P>
Platform: Xbox 360
</P>
<P>
Release date: Nov. 20
</P>
<P>
Genre: Action/role-playing
</P>
<P>
If this one ends up being nearly as good as it looks in previews,
expect it to land near the top of many year-end "best of" lists.
From the developer of "Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic"
and "Jade Empire," "Mass Effect" puts players into the shoes of a
human who must accomplish a familiar goal: Stop the extinction of
all intelligent life in the galaxy.
</P>
<P>
But "Mass Effect" aims to distinguish itself in how players
choose to accomplish that quest. Moral choices promise to shape
how others perceive your character -- and not as purely good or
evil, but as a mixture of both.
</P>
<P>
"Rock Band"
</P>
<P>
Platform: Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 2
</P>
<P>
Release date: Nov. 23 (Xbox 360, PS3); Dec. 10 (PS2)
</P>
<P>
Genre: Rhythm
</P>
<P>
Sure, the "Guitar Hero" series has the pedigree (and a new
version, "Guitar Hero III," out this week), but "Rock Band" has
the buzz. As well it should -- by turning your family room into a
concert hall, it's poised to give "Guitar Hero" all it can handle
in the battle of the virtual bands.
</P>
<P>
The "Rock Band" bundle will include the game, a guitar, a drum
set and a microphone, for a whopping $170 ($160 for the PS2
version) -- and that's not including a second guitar, which the
game also supports. Although you could buy the game by itself, it
wouldn't be much fun, not when it includes the master tracks of
songs by such bands as Nirvana, The Who, The Rolling Stones,
Metallica and Foo Fighters. Rock on.
</P>
<P>
"Assassin's Creed"
</P>
<P>
Platform: Xbox 360, PS3, PCs
</P>
<P>
Release date: Nov. 13
</P>
<P>
Genre: Action/adventure
</P>
<P>
Plenty of games have stressed stealth, but none has starred a
blade-wielding assassin in 12th-century Jerusalem. That's just
one reason we can't wait for "Assassin's Creed" -- one of many
reasons, actually. As Altair, you can scale the sides of
buildings, scamper along rooftops and dive into bales of hay. The
catch? You must do so without drawing too much attention to
yourself, lest you face the wrath of guards or passersby.
</P>
<P>
From the early looks we've had of the game, the trick is knowing
when to take flight and when to slow down, bow your head and
blend in with the crowd. Of course, fighting is necessary at
times -- but a good assassin knows his job is much easier if his
prey doesn't suspect he's coming.
</P>
<P>
"Super Mario Galaxy"
</P>
<P>
Platform: Nintendo Wii
</P>
<P>
Release date: Nov. 12
</P>
<P>
Genre: Platformer
</P>
<P>
Mario takes center stage for Nintendo once again in a game likely
to be one of the holiday season's bestsellers. His job, as
before, is to traverse a 3-D world full of obstacles and enemies
to save Princess Peach, who apparently has yet to figure out how
to keep from being kidnapped by the evil Bowser.
</P>
<P>
This time, though, Mario's actions are managed by the motion-
sensing Wii controller. And the worlds he must explore are unlike
any others in previous games. As the title suggests, Mario must
jump from galaxy to galaxy conquering mini-planets in his quest
to save the ever-imperiled Peach. Again.
</P>
<P>
"The Simpsons Game"
</P>
<P>
Platform: Xbox 360, PS3, PS2, Wii
</P>
<P>
Release date: This week
</P>
<P>
Genre: Action
</P>
<P>
It's difficult to pick a genre for "The Simpsons Game" -- simply
because, in true Simpsons fashion, it lampoons them all. Indeed,
ads for the game have featured fake posters for Medal of Homer (a
parody of the "Medal of Honor" first-person shooter), Grand Theft
Scratchy, Sitar Hero and Neverquest (a takeoff on the role-
playing game "Everquest").
</P>
<P>
From what we've seen of the game, it stays true to the series'
humor while combining a variety of gameplay styles. Marge, for
instance, in an effort to boycott the violent game-within-a-game
Grand Theft Scratchy, has the power to use her megaphone to
recruit townspeople for her angry mob -- which she can then
command to destroy anyone or anything that gets in her way. Ah,
irony.
</P>
<P>
"Call Of Duty 4: Modern Warfare"
</P>
<P>
Platform: Xbox 360, PS3, PCs
</P>
<P>
Release date: Monday
</P>
<P>
Genre: Shooter
</P>
<P>
In case the title failed to make this clear, the fourth iteration
in the excellent "Call of Duty" series -- unlike its predecessors
-- does not take place during World War II. What this means is
updated weaponry and missions in locales not confined to Europe,
Russia or North Africa. Here you're stalking terrorists, not
Nazis.
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, it also means a continuation of the same intense
firefights the series has become known for -- in environments
much richer in detail than before. In addition, the game promises
more of the same multi-player action the previous games
delivered.
