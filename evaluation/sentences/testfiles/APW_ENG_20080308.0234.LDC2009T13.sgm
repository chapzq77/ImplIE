Bush to veto bill banning use of waterboarding, other harsh
techniques on terror suspects

WASHINGTON 2008-03-08 06:17:32 UTC

<P>
President George W. Bush is poised to veto legislation that would
bar the CIA from using waterboarding -- a technique that
simulates drowning -- and other harsh interrogation methods on
terror suspects.
</P>
<P>
The president planned to talk about the veto in his Saturday
radio address.
</P>
<P>
Bush has said the bill would harm the government's ability to
prevent future attacks. Supporters of the legislation argue that
it preserves the United States' right to collect critical
intelligence while boosting the country's moral standing abroad.
</P>
<P>
"The bill would take away one of the most valuable tools on the
war on terror, the CIA program to detain and question key
terrorist leaders and operatives," deputy White House press
secretary Tony Fratto said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The bill would restrict the CIA to using only the 19
interrogation techniques listed in the Army field manual.
</P>
<P>
The legislation would bar the CIA from using waterboarding,
sensory deprivation or other coercive methods to break a prisoner
who refuses to answer questions. Those practices were banned by
the military in 2006, but the president wants the harsh
interrogation methods to be a part of the CIA's toolbox.
</P>
<P>
Backers of the legislation, which cleared the House in December
and won Senate approval last month, say the interrogation methods
used by the military are sufficient.
</P>
<P>
"President Bush's veto will be one of the most shameful acts of
his presidency," Democratic Sen. Edward Kennedy said in a
statement Friday. "Unless Congress overrides the veto, it will go
down in history as a flagrant insult to the rule of law and a
serious stain on the good name of America in the eyes of the
world."
</P>
<P>
He noted that the Army field manual contends that harsh
interrogation is a "poor technique that yields unreliable
results, may damage subsequent collection efforts, and can induce
the source to say what he thinks the (interrogator) wants to
hear."
