WASHINGTON, Jan. 24 (Xinhua)
</P>
<P>
Maurice Greene expects to regain the 100 meters world record
before the end of 2007, the sprinter said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"I know I am going to be," the 32-year-old said in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
"I know I have not done the best I can do," added Greene, who
grabbed the world record with a 9.79-second clocking at Athens in
1999.
</P>
<P>
Jamaican Asafa Powell lowered the mark to 9.77 seconds in 2005
and twice equalled the mark last year.
</P>
<P>
Injuries sidelined Greene for most of the 2006.
</P>
<P>
He will race for the first time in 10 months on Feb. 2 when he
competes over 60 meters in the 100th anniversary Millrose Games
at New York's Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
He holds the 60 meters world record at 6.39 seconds, but Greene
would not predict a time for Millrose since he just started speed
work last week.
