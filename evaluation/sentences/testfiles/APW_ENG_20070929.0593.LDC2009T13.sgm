A homemade bomb exploded Saturday outside a crowded city park in
the Maldives, wounding at least 12 people, all of them foreign
tourists, a government official said.
</P>
<P>
Officials in the Indian Ocean archipelago, renowned for its
exclusive tourist resorts, said they did not know who was behind
the attack that hit the crowded Sultan Park in the capital, Male,
about 3 p.m.
</P>
<P>
"The Maldives has never had something like this before. We are
taking this very seriously because tourism is our life blood,"
government spokesman Mohamed Shareef said.
</P>
<P>
The injured included two Britons, eight Chinese and two Japanese,
all of whom suffered burn injuries, Shareef said.
</P>
<P>
Maldives police did not immediately know how the bomb was
detonated or where it was planted, Shareef said.
</P>
<P>
He said it was too early to say whether the bomb targeted the
tourism industry and the possible involvement of an Islamic
Jihadist outfit, adding that all possibilities would be
investigated.
</P>
<P>
"They (the tourists) are still in a state of shock, and police
have still not interviewed them," Shareef said.
</P>
<P>
Authorities will seek help from Interpol, the United States and
India in investigating the blast, Shareef said.
</P>
<P>
The opposition Minivan News reported on its Web site that
witnesses said they saw nails, presumably from the bomb,
scattered in the park, which is located near the country's army
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
The Maldives, with a population of about 350,000, is by far the
wealthiest -- and most orderly -- country in south Asia. About
600,000 tourists visit the country each year, accounting for one-
third of its economy.
</P>
<P>
Though there has been tension and occasional outbreaks of
violence in recent years between government forces and opposition
activists, attacks against the tourist trade are virtually
unheard of.
</P>
<P>
But some Western diplomats have expressed concern about the
potential for violence in this Sunni Muslim country. Half the
population is under 18, reasonably well-educated and with few
prospects for good jobs. Some young people have turned to drug
use, while others have embraced a conservative strain of Islam
that had been virtually unheard of on the islands just a few
years ago.
