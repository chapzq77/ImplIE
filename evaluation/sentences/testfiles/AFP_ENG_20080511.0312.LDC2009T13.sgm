Britain accuses Myanmar junta of 'malign neglect'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
British Foreign Secretary David Miliband accused Myanmar's ruling
generals of "malign neglect" Sunday, warning the aftermath of its
cyclone was a "catastrophe of genuinely epic proportions".
</P>
<P>
Miliband also spoke out against the idea of going into Myanmar to
distribute aid despite the opposition of generals, saying any
such move would be a "last resort".
</P>
<P>
"A natural disaster is turning into a humanitarian catastrophe of
genuinely epic proportions, in significant part because of what I
would describe as the malign neglect of the regime," he told BBC
television.
</P>
<P>
Miliband was dismissive of suggestions that aid be delivered to
the country without the permission of the military junta.
</P>
<P>
"All the development experts say that that's not a very effective
way of delivering aid," he said.
</P>
<P>
"It might be the absolute last resort but all of the people who
are real experts in this area...are clear that that is very much
a third, fourth, fifth or even sixth-best solution, it's a last
resort".
</P>
<P>
Myanmar is a former British colony and became independent in 1948
after more than 60 years of colonial rule.
