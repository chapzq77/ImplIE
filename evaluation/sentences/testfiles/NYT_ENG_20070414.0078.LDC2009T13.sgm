RUSSIAN OPPOSITION LEADER DETAINED IN MOSCOW MARCH
</HEADLINE>

MOSCOW
</P>
<P>
Garry Kasparov, the former chess champion turned opposition
politician in Russia, was arrested with nearly 200 other
protesters during a rally in Moscow on Saturday that ended in
clashes with riot troops.
</P>
<P>
The rally, the third so-called Dissenters' March held by a loose
anti-government coalition known as Other Russia, was noteworthy
because authorities aggressively pursued the organizers,
including President Vladimir V. Putin's' former prime minister,
Mikhail M. Kasyanov, whom the police jostled but did not arrest.
</P>
<P>
The rally was principally supported by Kasyanov and Kasparov, who
leads a group here called the United Civil Front.
</P>
<P>
Essentially barred from access to television, members of Other
Russia have embraced street protests as the only platform to
voice their opposition ahead of parliamentary elections in
December and presidential elections next March. Early this month,
Kasyanov's and Kasparov's Web sites were blocked, though it was
unclear by whom.
</P>
<P>
The marches have become a test both of the determination of the
opposition and the willingness of the government to use force to
prevent it from gaining traction in street politics in the big
cities.
</P>
<P>
Other Russia was refused a permit to march in Moscow, but defied
the ban, as it has in two previous marches in St. Petersburg and
the Volga River city of Nizhny Novgorod. Authorities said roughly
9,000 police and Interior Ministry troops, known as OMON, were
deployed in Moscow on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
A Moscow police spokesman said 170 people were arrested;
organizers said the number was much higher.
</P>
<P>
In addition to Kasparov, who was arrested while walking on
Moscow's Tverskaya Street before arriving at the event, the
police detained Maria Gaidar, a daughter of a former prime
minister, and Ilya Yashin, the head of the youth wing of the
Yabloko opposition party.
</P>
<P>
"I'm arrested," Kasparov, who has left professional chess but is
still the world's highest-ranked player, said in a telephone
interview from inside a detention van. "It was an act of
banditry." There were reports that he was released, but by early
evening, Kasparov was still in custody.
</P>
<P>
Kasyanov, the former prime minister, was surrounded by riot
police as he approached the rally on foot. "Everybody should ask
themselves what is happening in our government," Kasyanov said,
as the police closed in. "We respect the constitution and demand
the authorities do the same."
</P>
<P>
"Take them one by one," a police officer commanded over a
bullhorn.
</P>
<P>
The police grabbed Kasyanov's bodyguards, arresting them, and
Kasyanov tumbled backward but was caught by the crowd. "Officers,
don't fulfill illegal orders," Kasyanov shouted. "Officers,
stop!"
