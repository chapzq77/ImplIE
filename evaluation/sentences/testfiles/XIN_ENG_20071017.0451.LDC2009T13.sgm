RIO DE JANEIRO, Oct. 17 (Xinhua)
</P>
<P>
Thirty hostages, including 16 children, taken captive during a
prison riot in Maranhao state, northeastern Brazil, were released
Wednesday. The hostages had been held for nearly 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
The inmates involved in the riot also surrendered to the police
and handed over a firearm they had used during the incident. The
prisoners backed down following negotiations with the police and
Charlene Ribeiro, wife of Bruno Monteiro da Silva, leader of the
riot.
</P>
<P>
The inmates agreed to surrender after the center's administrative
director signed a document promising not to torture any of the
rioters.
</P>
<P>
The riot broke out when Da Silva started shooting while
penitentiary agents were distributing snacks to the inmates'
children. The children were visiting the inmate center to attend
a party celebrating Children's Day. Four people were injured,
including two agents.
</P>
<P>
During the negotiations, the inmates also requested the transfer
of Da Silva, charged with provoking the riot, to another inmate
center.
</P>
<P>
Maranhao's Secretariat of Public Security said it will
investigate how the firearm was taken into the prison.
</P>
<P>
This was the third prison riot this month in Sao Luis, the
state's capital city.
