State of emergency in Mongolia amid violence: TV by Michael Kohn
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mongolian President Nambariin Enkhbayar late Tuesday declared a
four-day state of emergency amid violent protests in the capital
over alleged rigged elections, according to national
television."From 11:30 pm (1530 GMT) on Tuesday there will be a
four-day state of emergency," the announcement said.
</P>
<P>
It added that there would be a 10:00 pm curfew and anyone on the
streets after that time without documentation would be arrested.
</P>
<P>
Public gatherings are banned and any such meetings will be broken
up, according to the TV announcement, which also includes a ban
on media except for Mongolian national TV and state media
organisations.
</P>
<P>
The action was taken in response to the protests involving
thousands of people in Mongolia's capital on Tuesday, voicing
outrage over what they claimed were rigged elections.
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said police were forced to fire rubber bullets to quell
the violence.
</P>
<P>
The headquarters of the former communist Mongolian Peoples
Revolutionary Party (MPRP) in the centre of Ulan Bator was set
alight and looted, according to an AFP reporter and other
witnesses at the scene.
</P>
<P>
Some within roughly 6,000 protesters from the rival Democratic
Party, which claims the MPRP bought votes and used other tactics
to win Sunday's election, threw rocks at firefighters who arrived
to put out the blaze.
</P>
<P>
Police responded by firing rubber bullets and tear gas but the
clashes continued and showed few signs of abating as night fell.
</P>
<P>
Later, violence spread to other parts of the capital. A police
station was attacked when protesters attempted to free rioters
imprisoned earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
Part of the Cultural Palace, which contains an art gallery, a
museum and a theatre, was on fire early Wednesday as violence
continued.
</P>
<P>
Up to 30 policemen and 25 civilians were injured and hospitalised
in the rioting, according to television reports, citing officials
and hospitals.
</P>
<P>
A European photographer said he was been beaten by police when he
attempted to take photographs of police violence.
</P>
<P>
Politics in Mongolia, a country of 2.6 million people sandwiched
between China and Russia, has a recent history of turmoil and
disputes, but such violence is rare.
</P>
<P>
The technically neutral President Enkhbayar -- previously with
the MPRP -- earlier called an emergency security meeting that
involved Prime Minister Sanjagiin Bayar and all opposition party
leaders.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, broadcast live on the privately run Eagle
television, the MPRP- affiliated Bayar renewed his calls for
restraint while blaming the Democrats for inciting the rioters
after losing the elections.
</P>
<P>
Democrat leader Tsakhia Elbegdorj countered that MPRP corruption
had prompted the riots and torching of the MPRP building.
</P>
<P>
Before the unrest erupted, Elbegdorj said bluntly that "illegal
activities" had robbed the Democrats of victory.
</P>
<P>
"This was a dark moment in the history of Mongolia," he added.
</P>
<P>
The MPRP, which ruled for decades under the protection of the
former Soviet Union, says it won 45 seats in the 76-seat Great
Hural while the Democrats have reportedly won 21 seats.
</P>
<P>
The General Election Committee has yet to make a formal
announcement on the ballot.
</P>
<P>
"This election was run by one party. It is a false election," one
of the protesters, Galsan-Namjillin Sukhbaatar, told AFP outside
the MPRP's headquarters.
</P>
<P>
Another protester, Enkhamgalan Dorjsuren, 34, said: "The people
have come here to fight for their freedom."
</P>
<P>
The MPRP ruled Mongolia from its independence from the Chinese in
1921 until 1996, when it was beaten in elections by the
Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
In 2004, Mongolias last general election, the MPRP and the
Democrats nearly split the vote and were forced into a coalition
that produced three different prime ministers.
</P>
<P>
The instability held up economic reforms and shook investor
confidence, but the nation's economy still grew by 9.9 percent
last year thanks largely to its vast deposits of copper and gold.
