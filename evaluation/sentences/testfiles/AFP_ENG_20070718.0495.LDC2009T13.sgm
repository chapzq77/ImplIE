Broadcaster bids to halt Mbeki documentary
</HEADLINE>

<P>
South Africa's public broadcaster SABC sought a court order
Wednesday to prevent the screening of a documentary on President
Thabo Mbeki that was commissioned and then canned by the
corporation.
</P>
<P>
The documentary called "Unauthorised: Thabo Mbeki and the African
country" was due to be shown in select cinemas later this month
but the broadcaster has lodged an urgent interdict at the high
court, arguing it retains the copyright to the programme which
was made by the private Broad Daylight Productions.
</P>
<P>
"The documentary is our property and they do not have the right
to show it to anybody," said SABC spokesman Kaizer Kganyago.
</P>
<P>
The broadcaster has twice postponed the screening of the
documentary, which was originally due to be shown last year, on
editorial grounds.
</P>
<P>
The opening sequence, which has been seen by AFP, shows former
president Nelson Mandela warning Mbeki not to settle scores with
opponents after the latter was elected unopposed as head of the
ANC a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
Media rights groups have accused the SABC of self-censorship, an
accusation denied by the broadcaster.
</P>
<P>
"We have said it last year and we say it again, that there has
never been any pressure" from the presidency, Kganyago said on
SABC radio.
</P>
<P>
Jane Duncan, of the South Africa-based Freedom of Expression
Institute, said the SABC was stifling debate by seeking to halt
the screenings.
</P>
<P>
"Preventing the public from seeing the documentary is not the
answer, and a narrow approach towards copyright should not be
used to prevent the free flow of debate about the documentary,"
said Duncan.
