Hamas seizes control of main Gaza road, six militants die in
heavy clashes

GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip 2007-06-13 10:17:57 UTC
</P>
<P>
Fierce battles over key security positions spread to central Gaza
early Wednesday, with Hamas fighters wresting control of the
coastal strip's main north-south road -- and putting themselves
in position to cut off reinforcements to beleaguered Fatah
forces.
</P>
<P>
Gunmen also fought for control of high-rise buildings in Gaza
City that serve as sniper positions. Six militants died in
clashes near the besieged house of a senior Fatah commander in
Gaza City, in addition to four killed there on Tuesday, Hamas
said. Two other people died of wounds sustained in earlier
fighting.
</P>
<P>
A mortar shell hit the home of a deputy Cabinet minister from
Hamas in the nearby Shati refugee camp, setting it aflame,
security officials said. No one was injured, and the official was
not at home, officials said.
</P>
<P>
Violence in Gaza between the two factions, which nominally share
power in the Palestinian government, has rapidly spiraled in the
direction of all-out civil war, with more than 50 reported killed
since Monday. Hamas has systematically taken control of security
positions in the north and south, apparently leaving the main
battle for the strip's security and political nerve center in
Gaza City for last.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday afternoon, Hamas demanded Fatah-allied security
forces in the north relinquish their weapons by 7 p.m. (1600 GMT)
Friday, or risk having them taken by force. The ultimatum was
delivered in text messages and radio announcements.
</P>
<P>
Shops in Gaza City were shuttered tight Wednesday, and streets
were mostly empty as terrified residents huddled in homes that
could at any moment turn into battlegrounds, The U.N. Relief and
Works Agency announced it couldn't distribute food to the 30
percent of the Gaza Strip that relies on international food aid.
</P>
<P>
The mounting bloodshed touched off protests in two main Gaza
towns.
</P>
<P>
Several hundred tribal leaders, women, children and Islamic Jihad
militants turned out in Gaza City for a protest initiated by
Egyptian mediators. Some demonstrators scattered after masked
Hamas gunmen fired in the air, but others pushed on, carrying
Palestinian flags and shouting, "Do not shoot" and "national
unity" over a loudspeaker.
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said Hamas gunmen shot at the protesters as they
approached the besieged house of the Fatah commander from the
Bakr family in Gaza City, trapping the demonstrators.
</P>
<P>
Protester Bilal Qurashali said he saw a man get shot in the head.
"We are unable to get out. The place is closed," he said.
</P>
<P>
Health officials said 15 protesters were injured by bullets --
five of them in the head -- and were brought to the hospital in
civilian cars because ambulances couldn't navigate the heavy
fire.
</P>
<P>
Demonstrators had hoped the stature of the tribal leaders leading
the protest would protect them, he said.
</P>
<P>
Separately, Hamas gunmen opened fire from a high-rise building at
about 1,000 protesters in the southern town of Khan Younis,
injuring one and breaking up the protest. And a Fatah-affiliated
officer was shot to death at the National Security compound in
the town.
</P>
<P>
Confrontations have turned increasingly brutal in recent days,
with some killed execution-style in the streets, others in
hospital shootouts or thrown off rooftops. Both sides have been
arming themselves in recent weeks, smuggling weapons through
tunnels under the Gaza-Egypt border.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Hamas gunmen scored a key victory when they overran
the headquarters of a Fatah-allied security force in northern
Gaza. For hours, about 200 Hamas fighters fired mortars, rocket-
propelled grenades and machine guns at the compound, where some
500 Fatah loyalists were holed up and returned fire.
</P>
<P>
Thirty-five jeeploads of Fatah fighters were sent as
reinforcements, but never made it through Hamas roadblocks. After
nightfall, Hamas seized control.
</P>
<P>
Hamas reported another strategic win Wednesday, saying it seized
a Fatah post on the main north-south road, where security forces
often stopped cars carrying Hamas loyalists. Hamas said it
brought a bulldozer to flatten the post, made up of a mobile home
and several shacks.
</P>
<P>
Hamas also seized control of a Fatah post on Gaza's coastal road
-- another main artery for reinforcing Fatah troops.
</P>
<P>
Hamas and Fatah have waged a power struggle in fits and spurts
since Hamas won parliament elections last year, ending four
decades of Fatah rule. On Tuesday, Hamas signaled it was moving
into a decisive phase. It ignored pleas by Abbas and exasperated
Egyptian mediators to honor a cease-fire, and appeared to be
moving ahead according to a plan.
</P>
<P>
In contrast, Fatah commanders complained they were not given
clear orders by Abbas to fight back and that they had no central
command. Fatah's strongman in Gaza, Mohammed Dahlan, has spent
the last few weeks in Cairo for treatment of a knee injury. Other
leading Fatah officials left Gaza for the West Bank after
previous rounds of bloodshed.
</P>
<P>
"There's a difference between leading on the ground and leading
by mobile phone," police Col. Nasser Khaldi said of Dahlan's
absence. "Hamas is just taking over our positions. There are no
orders."
</P>
<P>
The power struggle escalated further Tuesday when Fatah suspended
the activities of its ministers in the government it shares with
Hamas. In an emergency meeting in the West Bank, Fatah warned it
would pull out of the government if the fighting doesn't stop,
said Nabil Abu Rdeneh, an aide to Palestinian President Mahmoud
Abbas, of Fatah.
</P>
<P>
There was concern that fighting might spread to the West Bank,
where Fatah has the upper hand.
</P>
<P>
Late Tuesday, Fatah gunmen wounded four Hamas activists in the
West Bank city of Nablus, Fatah said in a statement. On
Wednesday, unidentified gunmen opened fire at a Hamas school in
the West Bank city of Ramallah, security officials said. No one
was injured.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert proposed stationing
international forces along the Gaza Strip's volatile border with
Egypt to prevent arms from reaching Palestinian militants,
including Hamas. However, he ruled out assistance to Abbas'
forces.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. State Department, warning of a "very dangerous security
situation" in Gaza, advised journalists not to travel there and
urged any American journalists there to leave.
