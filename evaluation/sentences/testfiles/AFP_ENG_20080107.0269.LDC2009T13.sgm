EU president Slovenia calls for budget discipline from France
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Slovenia, which currently holds the rotating EU presidency, urged
France on Monday to make a greater effort to cut its public
deficit, saying that the EU's budget rules had to be respected by
both big and small countries.
</P>
<P>
"The rules of the game should be the same for every country, big
ones and small ones, and they should apply to France, too,"
Slovenian Finance Minister Andrej Bajuk told a news conference
here.

<P>
Last year, eurozone members set themselves the goal of balancing
their budgets by 2010 at the latest.
</P>
<P>
However, after being elected French President last year, Nicolas
Sarkozy asked his eurozone partners to set back the goal until
2012 if economic growth were not sufficiently strong.
</P>
<P>
The latest forecasts suggest that French economic growth is
indeed losing momentum.
</P>
<P>
Brussels has repeatedly called Paris to task in recent months
over its deficit.
</P>
<P>
Slovenia has also recently come under the scrutiny of the EU
Commission for the sharp surge in inflation in the country.
