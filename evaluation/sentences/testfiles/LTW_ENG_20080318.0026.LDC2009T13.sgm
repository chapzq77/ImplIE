Cost Nearly Doubles for Marine One Helicopter Fleet
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A year after Sept. 11, 2001, the White House set out to build a
fleet of state-of-the-art Marine One helicopters for the al-Qaida
age that would be safer, faster and more reliable than the iconic
white-topped aircraft that have landed on the South Lawn for
decades.
</P>
<P>
But the al-Qaida age has met the military acquisition process.
Six years later, the cost of the new helicopters has nearly
doubled, production has fallen behind schedule, and the bulk of
the program has been put on hold while the government tries to
figure out how to salvage it.
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon confirmed this month that the cost of the fleet of
28 new super-sophisticated helicopters has jumped from $6.1
billion when the contract was signed in 2005 to $11.2 billion
today. Outfitted with cutting-edge communications equipment,
antimissile defenses and hardened hulls, each of the VH-71
helicopters, to be dubbed Marine One whenever the president is
onboard, will cost $400 million. That price tag is more than the
one for the most recent Boeing 747 jetliner outfitted to serve as
Air Force One when it was delivered in 1990, even when adjusted
for inflation.
</P>
<P>
The problems have generated consternation in the White House,
Congress and Pentagon as officials attempt to grapple with yet
another military hardware purchase that has expanded beyond
initial parameters. In this case, though, they face the challenge
of ensuring that the president is safe from all sorts of
theoretical dangers and capable of running the country from
midair during a crisis.
</P>
<P>
"You don't think of it in terms of what's the cost of the
individual helicopter," said Jacques Gansler, a former
undersecretary of defense for acquisition, who has been asked to
review the project for the Defense Science Board. "You think of
it as, what do we need to do to protect the president?"
</P>
<P>
As a result, a vehicle that was supposed to be a modified version
of an existing helicopter "grows into an entirely different
thing," he said.
</P>
<P>
The specifications of the new craft remain largely secret, but
some details have leaked into trade publications or been
disclosed in congressional briefings. The 64-foot-long
helicopters must carry 14 passengers and thousands of pounds of
additional equipment while being able to fly farther without
refueling than existing Marine One choppers can. They must be
able to jam enemy radar, fend off incoming missiles and resist
some of the electromagnetic effects of a nuclear blast.
</P>
<P>
They also must have videoconferencing and encrypted
communications gear to allow the president to instantly reach
advisers, military officers and foreign leaders. Although the
president typically spends only short periods of time aboard the
White House helicopters, at times the president can be onboard
for longer distances. In a crisis, the White House says, minutes
can make a difference, so a president should have the full
capacity to act no matter where he or she is. In theory, a
commander in chief should even be able to order a nuclear strike
from the helicopter.
</P>
<P>
Why the cost has risen so much since the contract was signed with
a team led by Lockheed Martin remains in dispute. The company
declined to comment but has complained to supporters that the
Navy added 1,900 more requirements to the helicopters. The Navy
denies that, saying no extra requirements were added after the
contract.
</P>
<P>
"It's not the truth," said Stephanie Vendrasco, a spokeswoman for
the Navy program. "And we can't figure out where that number
comes from. It's a myth, and it's becoming a legend."
</P>
<P>
But she and other officials said no one completely grasped the
demands for the helicopter at first.
</P>
<P>
"The Navy and industry team did not clearly realize the full
implications of the White House requirements," John Young Jr.,
the undersecretary of defense for acquisition, said in a written
response to questions. To meet those requirements and retrofit a
commercial aircraft to Navy standards, he said, "the Navy and
industry teams are having to complete substantial redesign" of
the helicopter. He added that "this redesign work is driving
significant cost growth into the program."
</P>
<P>
Vendrasco attributed the problems partly to an attempt to speed
up the normal development process by three years. "There was just
a slow start out of the gate," she said. "And schedule is money."
</P>
<P>
The White House has insisted the project go forward. "We took a
look at what is the best thing to do for future presidents but
also looking at it from a cost-benefit analysis," said White
House spokesman Gordon Johndroe. "The consensus was future
presidents need a new helicopter. The current ones need to be
replaced."
</P>
<P>
Johndroe said President Bush has no personal stake in the project
because the helicopters will not be ready until after he leaves
office.
</P>
<P>
Presidents have had helicopters at their service since 1957, when
Dwight Eisenhower bristled at how long it took to get from a New
England vacation getaway to an airport during a crisis. Over the
years, sightings of presidents boarding Marine One on the White
House lawn have produced memorable moments, perhaps most famously
Richard Nixon's two-armed, double-V departure after his
resignation in 1974.
</P>
<P>
Many of the White House helicopters have been in service since
that era. The current fleet includes 19 aircraft -- 11 Sikorsky
VH-3D Sea Kings and eight VH-60N Black Hawks -- and the oldest
have flown presidents for 33 years.
</P>
<P>
The squadron also serves the vice president, defense secretary,
Navy secretary, visiting heads of state and other officials. So
many helicopters are needed because the president typically
travels with two or more when he flies, with the extras ferrying
staff and Secret Service, serving as backups and playing decoy.
When a president makes multiple stops, additional sets of
helicopters must be airlifted to his next destinations.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, for instance, Bush went to New York for an economic
speech. He climbed into Marine One on the South Lawn, and two
other helicopters accompanied him on the 10-minute flight to
Andrews Air Force Base, where he boarded Air Force One for the
trip north. At John F. Kennedy International Airport, another
pair of helicopters waited to fly him into Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
Although the Marines maintain the craft with painstaking care,
they occasionally break down. In 2006, for example, Bush accepted
the resignation of his press secretary, Scott McClellan, during
an emotional moment on the South Lawn, and the two then strode to
Marine One to fly off together. But the helicopter would not
work, and they had to get off and take a car.
</P>
<P>
Then-White House Chief of Staff Andrew Card Jr. grew aggravated
with the aging fleet's problems in 2002, and he launched the
effort to develop a new model with a post-Sept. 11 upgrade.
Although Lockheed Martin does not make helicopters, the Navy
chose it over longtime contractor Sikorsky Aircraft because the
company's European partner had a three-engine model that seemed a
logical off-the-shelf base for a new presidential helicopter. But
modifying the EH-101 has proven so complicated that the company
is essentially building a new helicopter.
</P>
<P>
The first five helicopters are due in 2010, a year behind
schedule, though the White House made compromises on the
requirements to cut costs and speed delivery. Twenty-three more-
sophisticated versions are to follow, at which point the current
fleet and the first five craft would be retired. But the most
recent target date of 2015 for these additional choppers has
slipped to an unknown date.
</P>
<P>
The problems with the second batch have prompted the Pentagon to
issue a stop-work order until it determines what to do and
Congress provides more money. The Pentagon conducted a review of
the project and considered 35 alternatives, but "none of these
options meet the full set of White House requirements," Young
said.
</P>
<P>
Britain last year bought six standard EH-101 helicopters for
about $57 million each -- roughly one-seventh of what it will
cost the United States to buy the same aircraft and retrofit it
for the president. Critics say that sort of mission creep has
become too common. "If it was going to cost $11 billion in the
first place, somebody should have said so," said Tom Schatz,
president of Citizens Against Government Waste.
</P>
<P>
Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn., whose district includes Sikorsky's
headquarters, said the drastic changes in the helicopter make it
a whole new aircraft, so it should be rebid. After all the twists
of this project, she said, "We ought to start over."
