Russia wants to send naval fleet to Venezuela: Chavez
</HEADLINE>

President Hugo Chavez said Sunday that Russian President Dimitri
Medvedev wants to send a Russian naval fleet to visit
Venezuela."Russia has informed us they intend to visit Venezuela,
that is, the intention that a Russian fleet should come to the
Caribbean," Chavez said on his weekly radio program.

<P>
"I told the president (Medvedev), 'If you're coming to the
Caribbean, we'll welcome you,'" Chavez said, adding that the
Russian naval fleet would pay "a friendly and working" visit to
Venezuela.

Under leftist President Chavez, Venezuela has been seeking closer
relations with Moscow, in part to buy military hardware,
including 24 Russian Sukhoi fighter jets recently delivered,
after Washington refused to supply spare parts for the F-16 jets
it sold Venezuela in the 1980s.

<P>
Over the past few years, Venezuela and Russia have signed 4.0
billion dollars' worth of arms deals, including AK-47 automatic
rifles and military helicopters.

"We very much need them here," Chavez said of the Russian
weapons. "We've got the helicopters, the Sukoi fighters and we're
now considering buying some Russian submarines to patrol our
territorial waters," Chavez said.

Chavez on Sunday also repeated his support for Moscow in its
conflict over Georgia's separatist territory of South Ossetia,
and called Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili "a puppet of
the United States."
