The man behind a notorious pyramid financial scheme that
defrauded thousands of Russians in the 1990s was released from
prison on Tuesday, Russia's Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Sergei Mavrodi, head of the MMM scheme, had served four-
and-a-half years in prison for fraud. He was arrested in 2003
after six years on the run from Russian authorities, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
In his trial, he was charged with defrauding some 40,000 people,
though thousands of others also lost money through MMM and he
continues to inspire strong feelings among Russians.
</P>
<P>
The amount of money lost is estimated at 100 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Mavrodi's share scheme lured millions of Russians by promising
sky-high annual returns. But the venture collapsed and Mavrodi
was put under investigation for tax evasion.
