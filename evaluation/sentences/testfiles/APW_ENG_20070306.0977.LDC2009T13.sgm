High-end eyewear maker Luxottica SpA plans to invest euro300
million (US$395 million) in its business this year, with at least
euro225 million (US$296 million) earmarked for expanding its
retail network, CEO Andrea Guerra told analysts on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Luxottica forecast that 2007 earnings per share would rise by as
much as 17 percent, pushed by demand for eyewear that it makes
through licensing agreements with fashion houses including
Versace and Chanel.
</P>
<P>
In forecasts released the day after it unveiled a 12 percent rise
in fourth-quarter net profit, Luxottica said it is targeting
earnings per share of between euro1.07 and euro1.09 (US$1.41 and
US$1.44) this year, up from fully diluted earnings per share of
euro0.93 (US$1.22) last year.
</P>
<P>
The Milan-based company also said it expects revenue to grow by
up to 6.8 percent in 2007, targeting full-year revenue of euro4.9
billion to euro5 billion (US$6.4 billion to US$ 6.5 billion)
compared with euro4.7 billion (US$6.2 billion) in 2006.
</P>
<P>
While the targets represent significant growth, they indicate
slowing growth compared with 2006.
</P>
<P>
Luxottica also said it expects revenue from its wholesale
operations -- supplying eyewear to third-party retailers -- to
climb about 15 percent in 2007. In 2006, revenue from wholesale
operations grew 31 percent to euro1.7 billion (US$2.2 billion).
