Barcelona striker Thierry Henry has paid his ex-wife a divorce
settlement of eight million pounds (9.2 million euros, 11.8
million dollars), a report said Friday.

Citing unnamed friends of Henry's former spouse, The Sun
newspaper said the sum was close to the 10 million pounds British
model Claire Merry had been seeking following their divorce in
September 2007.

<P>
"It was settled at the end of last week," Merry's friend was
quoted as saying. "Claire is delighted."
</P>
<P>
"Neither she or Thierry, who is French, wanted to go back to
court as they are both now moving on with their lives. She is
happy with the conclusion. She said it is cloes to the 10 million
pounds she wanted."

<P>
Henry and Merry divorced in September 2007, with her citing the
former Arsenal star's "unreasonable behaviour."
</P>

The couple met when they worked on television advertisements for
a car firm, and were married for four years, and have a three-
year-old daughter Tea.
