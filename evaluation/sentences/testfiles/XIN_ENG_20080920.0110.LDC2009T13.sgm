Merkel accuses Britain, U.S. of blocking tighter financial
controls

BERLIN, Sept. 20 (Xinhua)
</P>
<P>
German Chancellor Angela Merkel accused Saturday the United
States and Britain of blocking her government's previous efforts
to tighten the controls of financial markets.
</P>
<P>
According to German radio Deutsche Welle, Merkel made the remarks
when speaking to a rally in Linz of Austria on Saturday, where
she was campaigning on behalf of the Austrian conservative
People's Party (OeVP).
</P>
<P>
Merkel said her government had tried in vain to win G8 support
last year for tighter regulation of hedge funds and financial
oversight of capital markets, hinting that she felt vindicated in
her stance as a financial disaster unfolded on Wall Street in
recent days.
</P>
<P>
"It was said for a long time 'Let the markets take care of
themselves' and that there is 'no need for more transparency',"
Merkel told the rally.
</P>
<P>
"Today we are a step further because even America and Britain are
saying 'Yes, we need more transparency, we need better standards
for the ratings agencies'," Merkel was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
In a separate interview with a Munich newspaper, Muenchner
Merkur, to be published on Monday, Merkel criticized the United
States and British governments for obstructing Germany's efforts
in the first half of 2007 to bring greater transparency to the
markets.
</P>
<P>
"I criticize the perception that the financial markets have of
themselves," she told the paper. "Alas, they have opposed for too
long the introduction of rules with the backing of the British
and American governments," she said.
</P>
<P>
Merkel said when Germany headed the G8 group of industrialized
nations last year, it had advocated greater transparency in
international financial transactions, especially in hedge funds.
</P>
<P>
She said a single nation like Germany could do little by itself
to fix the international financial system.
</P>
<P>
"That's why I and Finance Minister Steinbrueck insisted back in
2007 during the German presidency of the Group of Eight that we
need more rules for greater transparency in international money
dealing, with the ratings agencies and with the hedge funds," she
was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Some progress was made at the time, but it was not adequately
supported by the United States and Britain," she said.
</P>
<P>
On Sept. 14, the fourth largest U.S. investment bank Lehman
Brothers Holdings announced that it went bankruptcy, triggering
worldwide financial turmoil including Germany, the biggest
economy of Europe.
