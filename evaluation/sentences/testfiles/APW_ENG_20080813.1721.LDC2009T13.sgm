Georgian president ' s Russia claims raise eyebrows
</HEADLINE>

TBILISI, Georgia 2008-08-13 23:27:02 UTC
</P>
<P>
It's the kind of claim that could provoke a dangerous Kremlin
riposte: The Pentagon is readying to take over airports and ports
in the former Soviet republic of Georgia.
</P>
<P>
The claim, by Georgia's U.S.-backed president, Mikhail
Saakashvili, on Wednesday was swiftly denied by officials in
Washington, who firmly denied any such designs on Georgian soil.
</P>
<P>
It was the latest in a string of overstated pronouncements by the
charismatic, American-educated Georgian leader that are further
fueling tensions with Moscow. His comments -- along with a stream
of biased, conflicting and often false information coming from
both Russian and Georgian officials -- have made it hard to
figure out what is really happening in the world's latest
hotspot.
</P>
<P>
Fighting between the Russian and Georgian armies raged for days,
leaving hundreds dead and some 100,000 forced from their homes.
The U.S. government and world diplomats are scrambling for a way
to cool the tensions, which erupted in warfare when Georgia
sought to retake control over the breakaway province of South
Ossetia last Thursday and Russia responded with overwhelming
military force.
</P>
<P>
Saakashvili has been conducting daily interviews in his fluent
English on international television networks and making frequent
televised speeches at home.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, he said in an interview on CNN that Russian troops
were "closing on the capital, circling," and planning to install
their own government in Tbilisi.
</P>
<P>
Associated Press reporters in the area saw no sign of an
impending coup. An AP reporter saw dozens of Russian trucks and
armored vehicles heading south from the central city of Gori in
the direction of Tbilisi, but they later turned away.
</P>
<P>
Saakashvili said Russian troops moving deeper into Georgia "even
steal toilet seats."
</P>
<P>
Saakashvili later said on Georgian national television that the
U.S. arrival of a military cargo plane with humanitarian aid
"means that Georgia's ports and airports will be taken under the
control of the U.S. Defense Department."
</P>
<P>
Pentagon spokesman Geoff Morrell responded, "We have no need, nor
do we intend to take over any Georgian air or seaport to deliver
humanitarian aid. ... We have no designs on taking control of any
Georgian facility."
</P>
<P>
Saakashvili has repeatedly compared the Russian incursions to
Hitler's invasion of Poland in 1939, to the Soviet crackdown in
Prague in 1968 and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979.
</P>
<P>
In his Wednesday TV address, he said, "Russia has lost more
airplanes than in any conflict of this scale since 1939." The
calculation seemed unlikely given how brief the fighting has been
and given how uneven the two countries' forces are.
</P>
<P>
He also cited rumors that Russia was planning to bomb a rally in
Tbilisi on Tuesday. The rally ended peacefully.
</P>
<P>
Saakashvili insists he's not overstating anything, and lamented
Wednesday that the West ignored his warnings that Russia was
planning a military operation in Georgia as "exaggerations."
</P>
<P>
"Now look what they're doing. This has already exceeded my worst
expectations."
</P>
<P>
Saakashvili, who graduated from Columbia University Law School,
has always been blunt, and his bold language and flamboyant
manner helped drive the Rose Revolution that brought him to power
after disputed elections in 2003.
</P>
<P>
He has long been derided in Russia, where he is seen as a vassal
of the United States as it seeks to expand its influence in
Moscow's backyard. The conflict has made that worse. Russian
President Dmitry Medvedev indirectly referred to his Georgian
counterpart as a "lunatic" on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Russia's leadership has been fierce -- and often wrong -- in its
claims about the conflict, too.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Prime Minister Sergei Ivanov said in a BBC interview
Wednesday, "There were many reports that Russian tanks are inside
Georgia which later proved out to be totally untrue." AP
reporters saw a Russian convoy in the area of Gori on Wednesday,
including support vehicles, ambulances, heavy cannons and about
100 combat troops.
