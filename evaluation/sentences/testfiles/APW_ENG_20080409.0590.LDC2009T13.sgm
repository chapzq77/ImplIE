ISLAMABAD, Pakistan 2008-04-09 10:51:39 UTC

Hundreds of people protesting an assault on a former Cabinet
minister and close supporter of President Pervez Musharraf
blocked roads and burned tires in his hometown Wednesday, police
said.
</P>
<P>
About 300 people gathered at a busy intersection in Mianwali,
setting tires ablaze and blocking traffic to condemn the Tuesday
attack on former parliamentary affairs minister Sher Afgan Niazi,
said Abdur Razzaq, a Mianwali police officer.
</P>
<P>
Niazi was not seriously hurt in the attack in the provincial
capital of Lahore after a mob of attorneys and others besieged
him in an office for several hours.
</P>
<P>
Aitzaz Ahsan, a prominent anti-Musharraf lawyer and president of
the Supreme Court Bar Association, tried in vain to disperse the
crowd and rescue Niazi. Ahsan announced later that he was
resigning as Supreme Court Bar Association president in protest.
</P>
<P>
The trouble began when irate protesters, including black-suited
lawyers, jostled Niazi and tried to beat him with their hands and
shoes when he emerged. Police bundled him into an ambulance,
which was stoned, and had its ignition key stolen, forcing over-
stretched security forces to push it away from the scene.
</P>
<P>
The incident could test the stability of Pakistan's new
government and weaken a movement for the restoration of senior
judges purged by the U.S.-allied president last year.
</P>
<P>
Television footage showed thick black fumes billowing from tires
set on fire Wednesday in Mianwali as dozens of men, some wielding
sticks, milled about.
</P>
<P>
In an overnight protest against lawyers, dozens of Niazi's
supporters set several rooms on fire at the Mianwali courts,
Razzaq said. No injuries were reported.
</P>
<P>
Authorities were holding talks with protest leaders to keep
things from getting out of control, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The situation is not so tense. They are only expressing their
sentiments," Razzaq said.
</P>
<P>
Niazi called for calm.
</P>
<P>
"For God's sake, do not do this. Be peaceful," he said on Express
News TV.
</P>
<P>
The attack on Niazi came a day after another close Musharraf
associate, the outgoing chief minister of neighboring Sindh
province, was beaten with a shoe and heckled in the provincial
legislature.
</P>
<P>
Musharraf and new Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani strongly
condemned the two attacks, issuing a joint statement saying such
"hooliganism" was designed to undercut political cooperation.
They called for an investigation to bring those responsible to
justice.
</P>
<P>
Ahsan played a key role last year in turning ousted Chief Justice
Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry into a symbol of resistance against
Musharraf, who seized power in a 1999 coup and only stepped down
as army chief in November.
</P>
<P>
A brilliant lawyer and powerful orator, he successfully defended
the independent-minded Chaudhry in court last year against a
first attempt by Musharraf to fire him.
</P>
<P>
Since opponents of the former military strongman won February
elections, Ahsan has warned of more big street protests unless
they keep a promise to restore the judges within a month.
</P>
<P>
The government plans to clip Musharraf's powers and review his
U.S.-backed policies against al-Qaida and the Taliban.
</P>
<P>
But Ahsan's resignation coincides with growing speculation in
Pakistan's media about a possible split in the new coalition
government that could help Musharraf cling to power.
