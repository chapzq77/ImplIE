Ford second-guesses corporate jets after criticism

Ford Motor Co. may sell its fleet of five corporate jets after
top executives of the three Detroit automakers were harshly
criticized by members of Congress this week for their travel
expenses.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued Friday, Ford said it is exploring all
options for the fleet, which it said has been reduced from nine
in 2005.
</P>
<P>
"Ford's top priority is to continue making progress on our
transformation plan, and we do not want anything to distract us,"
spokesman Mark Truby said in a statement. "We are exploring all
cost-effective solutions for our air travel."
</P>
<P>
The announcement comes just days after Ford chief executive Alan
Mulally, Chrysler LLC chief executive Robert Nardelli and General
Motors Corp. chief executive Rick Wagoner traveled to Washington
on separate corporate jets to seek $25 billion in government
loans to help them make it through the worst U.S. auto sales
downturn in 25 years.
</P>
<P>
Congress, though, abandoned a vote on the bailout after a
disastrous appearance in which the automakers were criticized for
lavish corporate travel, as well as for having poor business
plans and high labor costs that some members said would keep them
from being competitive with Toyota Motor Corp. and Honda Motor
Co.
</P>
<P>
Corporations typically lease planes, buy them or charter aircraft
to transport executives and other employees. Many require
executives to travel by corporate jet for security reasons and so
they can meet with other executives and do work while traveling.
</P>
<P>
Truby said that of the five remaining jets, three are used for
executive travel, while the other two shuttle employees such as
engineers to factories where new products are being launched.
</P>
<P>
"We have been and continue to look at all of our operations to
reduce costs and operate more efficiently," he said.
</P>
<P>
GM said Thursday that it was in the process of returning two of
its five leased corporate jets to the leasing company.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman Tom Wilkinson said the company planned to return the
jets because travel spending had been cut. The jets were
scheduled to be returned even before the automakers were
criticized in Washington, he said.
</P>
<P>
"It would have been done anyway," Wilkinson said. "It's just the
travel cutbacks have been so severe. It's just not being used."
</P>
<P>
GM started the year with seven leased jets but returned two of
them in September, Wilkinson said.
</P>
<P>
Chrysler spokesman David Elshoff would not comment on its jets.
