Israeli airstrike kills Palestinian militant in Gaza

GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip 2007-04-07 08:19:39 UTC
</P>
<P>
An Israeli helicopter launched an airstrike along the Gaza
Strip's border with Israel early Saturday, officials said,
killing a Palestinian militant and wounding two others and
further straining a fragile cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
In the West Bank, meanwhile, Israeli troops clashed with
Palestinian gunmen, wounding one of the area's most wanted and
best-known militants. Zakariye Zubeidi, a leader of the Al Aqsa
Martyrs' Brigades, was moderately wounded in the shoulder, the
group said.
</P>
<P>
The army said it carried out Saturday's airstrike, near the
Jebaliya refugee camp in northern Gaza, after spotting the
militants trying to plant a bomb. It said militants had planted
explosives in the same area two days earlier.
</P>
<P>
The Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine, a small
militant group, said the militants were "on a holy mission" when
they were hit by the Israeli force.
</P>
<P>
In a joint statement with the Islamic Jihad militant group, the
DFLP said the dead militant, 22, blew himself up in an attempt to
cause casualties among Israeli ground troops.
</P>
<P>
However, Palestinian medical officials said the nature of the
man's wounds indicated the airstrike was the cause of death.
</P>
<P>
The incident was the latest blow to the truce, reached last
November between Israel and Palestinian militants in Gaza.
</P>
<P>
Israel says militants have been exploiting the lull to smuggle
explosives, missiles and other weapons into Gaza through tunnels
from neighboring Egypt. During the truce, militants also have
continued to fire rockets into Israel.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, a Palestinian gunman was killed in an exchange of
fire with Israeli troops in an area where militants frequently
fire rockets toward Israel.
</P>
<P>
The army said militants have planted more than 40 bombs along the
border since the cease-fire declaration.
</P>
<P>
Israeli military officials have repeatedly warned of the arms
buildup in Gaza in recent weeks, and the army has been preparing
for a large-scale invasion.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Ehud Olmert has so far refused to authorize such
an operation. But his defense minister, Amir Peretz, has given
the green light for limited operations along the border to halt
rocket launchers, bombings or infiltrations. Israel withdrew from
Gaza, ending a 38-year occupation, in September 2005.
</P>
<P>
Also Saturday, the Al Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades, a militant group
linked to President Mahmoud Abbas' Fatah party, said Zubeydi was
shot in the shoulder during a gunbattle with Israeli forces in
the northern West Bank city of Jenin.
</P>
<P>
Israel's army confirmed it fired at a gunman in a battle in
Jenin's refugee camp overnight, but said it did not know the
identity of the target. Israel says Zubeydi has been involved in
numerous attacks against Israelis, including deadly roadside
shootings.
</P>
<P>
Zubeydi, a fluent Hebrew speaker, is often interviewed by the
Israeli media. He is best known for his friendship with an
Israeli woman, Tali Fahima, who was jailed for more than two
years on charges she shared classified information with Zubeydi.
