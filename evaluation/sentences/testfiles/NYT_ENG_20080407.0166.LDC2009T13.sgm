BUSH SAYS ECONOMY IS POISED TO REBOUND

WASHINGTON
</P>
<P>
President Bush urged Congress on Monday to resist efforts by
Democrats to pass a second economic stimulus package, saying that
while the economy is "in a rough time right now," he is confident
it will begin to rebound by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
On his first day back from a swing through Eastern Europe and
Russia, Bush summoned small-business leaders to the White House
to showcase the first stimulus package, signed into law in
February. That package included rebates for taxpayers -- the
White House says the checks will start to go out next month --
and tax incentives intended to encourage businesses to invest.
</P>
<P>
Bush urged lawmakers to give the law a chance to work before
passing a new one. "Give this one a chance to kick in," he said.
</P>
<P>
But in the wake of a bleak report on Friday that showed 80,000
jobs were lost in March, Democrats say there is no time to waste.
The House speaker, Nancy Pelosi of California, has called on Bush
to work with Congress in passing a new stimulus bill and has said
she will raise the issue with Bush directly at a meeting
scheduled for Wednesday at the White House.
</P>
<P>
Pelosi is proposing a package that would include an extension of
unemployment benefits, a provision that the White House opposed
in negotiations over the first stimulus package. At the same
time, Senate Democrats and Republicans are working together on a
housing bill to help struggling homeowners avert foreclosure; the
White House says it has "deep concerns" about that legislation.
</P>
<P>
In pushing back against additional government intervention in the
economy, Bush is drawing a sharp contrast between himself and
Democrats, who intend to make rising unemployment and the
economic downturn a centerpiece of their fall election campaigns.
</P>
<P>
But he could be making life difficult for Republicans, who will
face questions from voters about what they are doing to make life
better for ordinary Americans and who will have to decide whether
to stick with the White House or break with Bush when the housing
and stimulus bills come up for votes.
</P>
<P>
At Monday's White House event, Bush commended a group of
businessmen and women who said tax incentives had led them to
invest more in their companies.
</P>
<P>
But he conceded that Americans remained concerned, saying "not
only are people worried about their homes, they're worried about
the cost of fuel."
