Russia investigates financial crisis reporting: report
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Prosecutors are launching inquiries across Russia against media
reporting on the financial crisis in a bid to stem growing
concern about its impact, the Kommersant newspaper reported on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"It's not censorship. We're just checking how reliable the
information is," a press official from the prosecutor general's
office was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The official gave the example of unreliable reports about a
bankruptcy causing a run on deposits from a bank in the Far
Eastern port of Vladivostok.

<P>
Regional prosecutors have been ordered to check local media "in
connection with measures taken by the Russian government to
improve the situation in the financial sector and other sectors
of the economy," Kommersant said.
</P>
<P>
Investigators in Sverdlovsk, a key industrial region in the Ural
mountains, are checking local media for attempts "to destabilise
the situation in the region," a spokeswoman for the local
prosecutor's office was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
"If we establish that the law has been violated, there could be
disciplinary measures against the guilty, including criminal
punishment," she said.
</P>
<P>
As the crisis has worsened in Russia, officials have voiced
growing concern about the reaction among a public still mindful
of the economic chaos and social upheaval that followed the 1998
financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Russian President Dmitry Medvedev this month told law enforcement
to monitor attempts at "destabilising the social situation"
during the crisis, saying: "We have a stable state... We don't
need a return to the 1990s."
