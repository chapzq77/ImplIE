Winslet gives libel cash to eating disorder charity
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Oscar-nominated actress Kate Winslet has donated libel damages
she won over a magazine report saying she sought help for a
weight problem to an eating disorder charity.
</P>
<P>
The British star was not in London's High Court Friday, but her
solicitor said the story published in February by the weekly
glossy Grazia caused her personal hurt, distress, anger and
embarrassment and damaged her reputation.
</P>
<P>
"I am not a hypocrite. I have always been, and shall continue to
be, honest when it comes to body/weight issues," she said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
The star's lawyer said the article wrongly claimed she sought
help with her weight from an LA doctor. She has previously gone
on record as saying she would not bow to Hollywood pressure to be
skinny.
</P>
<P>
In Grazia's article, Dr Yi Pan discussed treatments he offered to
Hollywood A-listers including Winslet at his Chinese Healing
Institute in California.
</P>
<P>
Winslet -- nominated for Best Actress at this year's Oscars --
immediately complained to publisher Emap London Lifestyle Ltd,
saying the article suggested she had lied to the public.
</P>
<P>
Atkins said Winslet did receive treatment from Dr. Pan for a neck
injury, but did not seek any treatment for weight loss.
</P>
<P>
Winslet said she was "delighted" the matter had been resolved.
"Grazia magazine have apologised to me in full, and admitted that
their story was incorrect, which gives me tremendous peace of
mind.
</P>
<P>
"I am donating the damages given to me by Grazia to an eating
disorder charity." The charity involved was not identifed. Her
lawyers said that the sum involved was substantial.
