Low chance of terrorists obtaining nukes, but governments must be
vigilant, US expert says

Terrorists have little chance of making a nuclear bomb, but
governments must remain on guard against the possibility, a top
U.S. expert said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Only about 8 kilograms (17.6 pounds) of highly enriched uranium
-- far too little to make a nuclear device -- is believed to have
leaked into the global black market, said Mark Fitzpatrick,
senior fellow for nonproliferation at the London-based
International Institute for Strategic Studies.
</P>
<P>
"This is the classic low-probability, high-consequence danger
that governments must focus a great deal of attention" on, said
Fitzpatrick, a former deputy assistant secretary for
nonproliferation at the U.S. State Department.
</P>
<P>
Fitzpatrick was speaking to reporters ahead of the IISS's annual
Shangri-La Dialogue, a meeting of defense chiefs and scholars
held in Singapore.
</P>
<P>
A minimum of 20-25 kilograms (44-55 pounds) of weapons-grade
uranium would be needed to make an implosion-type nuclear device,
while four times that much would be needed to make a much simpler
gun-type device, Fitzpatrick said.
</P>
<P>
Amounts of uranium involved in most clandestine smuggling
attempts are typically small, Fitzpatrick said, citing a sting
operation on the Russia-Georgia border last year in which 100
grams (3.53 ounces) of uranium was recovered.
</P>
<P>
"Probably it's not so easy to get hold of fissile material, but
that doesn't mean complacency should rule. Maybe it's only the
tip of the iceberg," Fitzpatrick said.
</P>
<P>
Osama bin Laden's al-Qaida network has expressed interest in
obtaining nuclear weapons while Iran, considered a major sponsor
of Islamic terrorist groups by Washington, is in a deadlock with
the West over its refusal to suspend uranium enrichment.
</P>
<P>
Fears of nuclear weapons technology falling into terrorist hands
were also stirred by investigations into the black market network
of Pakistani scientist A.Q. Khan.
</P>
<P>
That incident, in part, prompted the U.N. Security Council to
adopt Resolution 1540 in April 2004, requiring all U.N. members
to pass laws preventing terrorists and black marketeers from
dealing in weapons of mass destruction, the materials to make
them, and the missiles and other systems to deliver them.
</P>
<P>
Fitzpatrick called the resolution a "good start," but said
follow-through by states on implementing its requirements has
been "weak to the point of negligence."
</P>
<P>
While such defects must be addressed, the public should not be
overly anxious about the possibility of a terrorist nuclear bomb,
Fitzpatrick said.
</P>
<P>
"Is it a kind of a risk that the public should be worrying about
day-to-day? I would say not," said Fitzpatrick. "The probability
is too low for people to be worrying about and keeping up at
night.
</P>
<P>
"But is it the kind of risk that governments should spend a great
deal of attention trying to prevent? Absolutely," he said.
