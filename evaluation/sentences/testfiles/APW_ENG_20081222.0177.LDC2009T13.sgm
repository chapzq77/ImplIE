Ireland unveils euro5.5 billion bank bailout
</HEADLINE>

DUBLIN, Ireland 2008-12-22 07:17:45 UTC
</P>
<P>
Ireland will invest at least euro5.5 billion ($7.7 billion) in
three Irish banks to boost their cash reserves, investor
confidence and the banks' ability to lend, the government
announced.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Brian Lenihan said Sunday night that the boards
of the three banks -- Allied Irish, Bank of Ireland and Anglo-
Irish -- would issue preference shares paying fixed dividends to
the government in exchange for the aid. The plan still requires
shareholder approval at emergency meetings expected next month.
</P>
<P>
The plan is designed to boost each bank's cash reserves and
restore international confidence in Ireland's banking sector,
which faces rising loan defaults and the prospect of worse to
come from a deepening recession.
</P>
<P>
Allied Irish Banks PLC, Ireland's biggest bank, and No. 2 Bank of
Ireland both are in line to receive euro2 billion. In return the
government will receive preference shares paying a fixed 8
percent dividend -- or euro160 million a year from each bank --
as well as 25 percent of voting rights in the bank's board of
directors.
</P>
<P>
Anglo-Irish Bank Corp., a specialist lender heavily exposed to
the collapse of Ireland's property and construction markets,
would fall under government control.
</P>
<P>
The government has agreed to pay euro1.5 billion for preference
shares in Anglo-Irish that will pay a 10 percent fixed dividend,
or euro150 million annually. The government would receive 75
percent of voting rights if shareholders approve the plan.
</P>
<P>
Lenihan said all three banks could pay back the aid at face value
within the next five years, or 125 percent of its value after
five years. He also said the government was ready to provide more
aid if the banks' share values and ability to lend didn't
markedly improve.
</P>
<P>
The finance chief said the government was willing to underwrite
the issuing of euro1 billion each in new Allied Irish and Bank of
Ireland shares -- which means the government would purchase any
new shares that existing shareholders decline to buy.
</P>
<P>
Bank of Ireland said it was interested in the government's
underwriting offer. Allied Irish said it remained hopeful of
raising sufficient funds from selling its own assets,
particularly its minority stake in M&amp;T Bank Corp. of New
York.
</P>
<P>
Lenihan said the government's representatives on the boards of
all three banks would ensure that the banks increase mortgage
lending by 30 percent and loans to small business by 10 percent.
The banks also would be expected to back off defaulting mortgage-
holders, giving them a six-month grace period.
</P>
<P>
Ireland's long-booming economy has gone swiftly into reverse over
the past year. Its recession is forecast to deepen in 2009 and
unemployment rise to 10 percent or more.
