Head of watchmaker Rolex steps down after 16 years: company
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Luxury Swiss watchmaker Rolex announced Wednesday the surprise
departure of its chief executive, Patrick Heiniger, who has
overseen the group for the last 16 years.
</P>
<P>
Heiniger, 58, who took over from his father in 1992, is to leave
to "pursue personal projects," the group said.
</P>
<P>
Rolex, founded in 1905 and famous for its expensive watches, gave
no details about a replacement but said Heiniger would remain as
an advisor to the group.
</P>
<P>
Swiss newspaper Egefi linked Heiniger's departure to the Bernard
Madoff scandal in the United States, but the report published
Wednesday was denied by Rolex.
</P>
<P>
Egefi claimed Rolex might be a victim in the alleged 50-billion-
dollar fraud by Madoff and this had shown Heiniger's willingness
to take high risks.
</P>
<P>
The group is privately owned by the Geneva-based foundation Hans
Wilsdorf and declined to comment further.
