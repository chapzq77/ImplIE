BP-led consortium starts production at second well in Caspian Sea
natural gas field

BAKU, Azerbaijan 2007-02-20 14:03:58 UTC

<P>
A BP PLC-led consortium began pumping gas Tuesday from a second
production well at a giant Caspian Sea field off Azerbaijan's
coast less than a month after the first well was shut down for
unspecified technical reasons.
</P>
<P>
Gas from the Shah Deniz field -- one of Azerbaijan's largest --
has been keenly awaited by both Azerbaijan and neighboring
Georgia, both of which have been affected by Russia's decision to
increase prices sharply last year.
</P>
<P>
The second well began pumping early Tuesday and gas from the
field had already entered the pipeline system of Azerbaijan's
state oil company, SOCAR, the company said in a statement. SOCAR
holds 10 percent in the consortium developing the field.
</P>
<P>
BP, which holds a 25.5 percent stake, has forecast output at 2.8
billion cubic meters of gas in 2007 from a planned total of four
production wells. The consortium also includes Norway's Statoil,
France's Total, Russia's Lukoil and other companies.
</P>
<P>
Commercial production began at the field's first well in
December, but was stopped a week later due to unspecified
technical problems. The well came back onstream a month later on
Jan. 14, but the company announced it had again been shut on Jan.
23.
</P>
<P>
The Dec. 15 halt in production forced Georgia to sign stopgap gas
supply deals with Moscow at what it considers to be extortionate
prices.
