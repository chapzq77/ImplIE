squad created an uproar, was Sunday included in a 25-man
Australia A squad for the IRB Pacific Nations Cup.

The high-scoring NSW Waratahs fullback/winger was not included
among Australian rugby's top 59 players, leading him to
unsuccessfully seek a release from the Waratahs and play club
football in England.

But the 29-year-old back and rugby league import Clinton
Schifcofske, also omitted from the original training squad, were
both named in the Australia A squad for matches against Tonga,
Samoa, Japan, the Junior All Blacks and Fiji.

Hewat finished the Super 14 season as Australia's leading scorer
with 156 points from two tries, 19 conversions and 36 penalty
goals.

ACT Brumbies lock Alister Campbell was named captain of Australia
A, after leading the team on two occasions in 2006.

Australia's most-capped hooker Jeremy Paul was named in the
Australia A squad after missing out on the Wallabies' 30-man
