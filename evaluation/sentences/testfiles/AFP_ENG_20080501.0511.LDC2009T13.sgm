Senegal's PM confirms India to fully supply rice needs
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Senegalese Prime Minister Cheikh Hadjibou Soumare confirmed
Wednesday India would furnish the west African nation with its
full supply of rice needs for the next six years despite a
suspension of exports.Senegal has been hit by protests against
rising prices of staples such as rice, amid a global food crisis
which has sparked fears of malnutrition and political unrest in
developing countries.
</P>
<P>
"India had said: 'I won't make any more rice exports but that has
nothing to do with what the head of state (Abdoulaye Wade)
obtained from the Indian premier," said Soumare, quoted by local
media.
</P>
<P>
Despite India restricting exports to premium long grain basmati
rice on April 1, President Wade said a week ago that he received
New Delhi's assurance of a supply of 600,000 tonnes annually for
the next six years.
</P>
<P>
"I have received a message from India's prime minister (Manmohan
Singh), following my request for rice supply to meet the full
needs of national consumption," Wade said on national television.
</P>
<P>
"Having consulted with his government, he told me that India will
supply all Senegal's rice requirements, in other words 600,000
tonnes annually for six years."
</P>
<P>
India is the world's third largest rice exporter.
</P>
<P>
Wade added that the six-year timeframe would allow Senegal to
develop rice cultivation in a bid for self-sufficiency, adding
that the country's population should show "a bit of patience"
ahead of stocks arriving.
</P>
<P>
Certain newspapers queried Wade's announcement, while several
members of the opposition also voiced skepticism.
</P>
<P>
There was no further detail from Dakar as to how Senegal had
managed to reach such an agreement.
</P>
<P>
But Soumare confirmed India's promise, mentioning "bilateral
accords" without giving details.
</P>
<P>
New Delhi hosted an Indian-African summit on April 8 and 9 and
accorded preferential status to African nations in need of rice
stocks.
</P>
<P>
India on April 1 hiked the minimum export price for basmati to
1,200 dollars per metric tonne from 1,100 dollars.
</P>
<P>
Rice is one of the staples -- mostly imported -- whose prices
have skyrocketed in Senegal, prompting demonstrations against the
rising cost of living, themselves banned.
