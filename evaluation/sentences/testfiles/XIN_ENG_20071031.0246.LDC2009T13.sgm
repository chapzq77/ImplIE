Sri Lankan president revokes military news censorship

COLOMBO, Oct. 31 (Xinhua)
</P>
<P>
Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapakse decided to revoke with
immediate effect a gazette notification issued earlier on
Wednesday imposing a military news censorship, a top official
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"The president has decided to revoke the gazette. He expects the
media to act responsibly," Chandrapala Liyanage, the president 's
director general for media said.
</P>
<P>
The government gazette bearing number 1521/3 dated Oct. 29 was
issued Wednesday barring the media from disseminating information
on military operations or information with regard to the
procurement of military equipment.
</P>
<P>
The violating editors were to be subject to a jail term not less
than three years in addition to being imposed fines.
</P>
<P>
"The president later decided that existing laws are enough to
deal with anyone who acts irresponsibly so there is no need for a
censorship," Liyanage said.
</P>
<P>
The gazette came to be issued as the government last week
withdrew broadcasting licenses of five radio channels for
irresponsible dissemination of incorrect information.
</P>
<P>
The government had a similar news censorship during 2000-2001
period at the height of a military campaign against the rebel
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE).
</P>
<P>
Conflict between government troops and the LTTE has been
escalating since the end of 2005, making the Norwegian brokered
peace agreement exist only on paper.
</P>
<P>
Claiming discrimination at the hands of the Sinhala majority, the
LTTE has been fighting the government since the mid-1980s to
establish a separate homeland for the minority Tamils in the
north and east.
