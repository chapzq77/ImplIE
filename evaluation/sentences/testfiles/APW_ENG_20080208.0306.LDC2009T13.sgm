American public has dimmest view yet of Bush, Congress in AP poll

WASHINGTON 2008-02-08 05:25:59 UTC
</P>
<P>
It's almost as if Americans can barely stand the thought of
President George W. Bush and Congress anymore.
</P>
<P>
Bush reached his lowest approval rating in The Associated Press-
Ipsos poll on Friday, as only 30 percent said they like the job
he is doing, including an all-time low in his support by
Republicans. Congress' approval fell to just 22 percent, equaling
its poorest grade in the survey. Both marks dropped by 4
percentage points since early January.
</P>
<P>
The dour public mood seems to chiefly reflect distress over the
doddering economy, which has seen job cuts, financial market
slides and real estate losses stoke recession fears. Bush's
approval for handling the economy dove to 29 percent, a slide of
4 percentage points in a month and matching his low on that
issue, with noticeable slumps among middle-income people,
Southerners and city residents.
</P>
<P>
"He's spent billions of dollars on the war, and the economy here
is suffering," said Ron Brathwaite, 41, a Democrat from New York
who was interviewed in the poll. "If you're leading this country,
you should start fixing within this country."
</P>
<P>
Bush and Congress have been overshadowed in recent months by a
presidential campaign in which both parties' candidates have
emphasized how they would change Washington -- an implicit
criticism of the president and the Democratic-led Congress. Even
the leading Republican contenders have spent little time
defending Bush, though they haven't attacked him frequently
because he remains popular with some in the Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
Yet Bush's acceptance by his own party is at bottom in the AP-
Ipsos poll. Just 61 percent of Republicans gave Bush positive
reviews; his previous low was 65 percent last month. Only 28
percent of them expressed strong approval.
</P>
<P>
About one in 10 Democrats and three in 10 independents gave Bush
positive marks.
</P>
<P>
"I believe we have to protect the country at all costs," said
Jack Vogt, 61, a retiree from Lakeland, Florida, and a strong
Bush supporter. He said he did not fault the president or
Congress for the economy's problems, saying, "I don't feel they
can influence it one way or the other."
</P>
<P>
Bush's previous overall low in the AP-Ipsos poll came in November
when his approval rating was 31 percent. His current level is
essentially even with that.
</P>
<P>
Congress also hit 22 percent in October. It usually has lower
ratings than the president because it is an institution people
love to criticize. Many have negative views of Congress while
still supporting their own House and Senate members.
</P>
<P>
Even so, its ratings are approaching its historic low in the
Gallup Poll of 18 percent reached in early 1992 during a furor
over lawmakers who bounced House bank checks. Only about one in
five Democrats, Republicans and independents approve of Congress'
work, with less than one in 20 from each group approving
strongly.
</P>
<P>
Bush also hit a new low in this month's poll for his work on
domestic issues like health care, energy and the environment,
getting approval from 27 percent, a 7-point tumble since January.
Thirty-three percent approved of his handling of the war in Iraq,
virtually unchanged.
</P>
<P>
Underlining the public gloom, after a brief holiday uptick, the
mood of the country has returned to its level in November, with
just 25 percent saying the country is headed in the right
direction.
</P>
<P>
President Harry Truman had the lowest rating ever in the Gallup
Poll with 23 percent approval in 1952 during the Korean War;
President Richard Nixon reached 24 percent during the summer of
1974 before he resigned during the Watergate scandal.
</P>
<P>
The AP-Ipsos poll was conducted Feb. 4-6 and involved telephone
interviews with 1,006 adults. It had a margin of sampling error
of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points.
