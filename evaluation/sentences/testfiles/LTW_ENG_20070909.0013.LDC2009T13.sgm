Why We Should Exit Iraq Now
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama and John Edwards have suggested
that there is little difference among us on Iraq. This is not
true: I am the only leading Democratic candidate committed to
getting all our troops out and doing so quickly.
</P>
<P>
In the most recent debate, I asked the other candidates how many
troops they would leave in Iraq and for what purposes. I got no
answers. The American people need answers. If we elect a
president who thinks that troops should stay in Iraq for years,
they will stay for years -- a tragic mistake.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, Obama and Edwards reflect the inside-the-Beltway
thinking that a complete withdrawal of all American forces
somehow would be "irresponsible." On the contrary, the facts
suggest that a rapid, complete withdrawal -- not a drawn-out,
Vietnam-like process -- would be the most responsible and
effective course of action.
</P>
<P>
Those who think we need to keep troops in Iraq misunderstand the
Middle East. I have met and negotiated successfully with many
regional leaders, including Saddam Hussein. I am convinced that
only a complete withdrawal can sufficiently shift the politics of
Iraq and its neighbors to break the deadlock that has been
killing so many people for so long.
</P>
<P>
Our troops have done everything they were asked to do with
courage and professionalism, but they cannot win someone else's
civil war. So long as American troops are in Iraq, reconciliation
among Iraqi factions is postponed. Leaving forces there enables
the Iraqis to delay taking the necessary steps to end the
violence. And it prevents us from using diplomacy to bring in
other nations to help stabilize and rebuild the country.
</P>
<P>
The presence of American forces in Iraq weakens us in the war
against al-Qaida. It endows the anti-American propaganda of those
who portray us as occupiers plundering Iraq's oil and repressing
Muslims. The day we leave, this myth collapses, and the Iraqis
will drive foreign jihadists out of their country. Our departure
would also enable us to focus on defeating the terrorists who
attacked us on Sept. 11, those headquartered along the Pakistan-
Afghanistan border -- not in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Logistically, it would be possible to withdraw in six to eight
months. We moved as many as 240,000 troops into and out of Iraq
through Kuwait in as little as a three-month period during major
troop rotations. After the Persian Gulf War, we redeployed nearly
a half-million troops in a few months. We could redeploy even
faster if we negotiated with the Turks to open a route out
through Turkey.
</P>
<P>
As our withdrawal begins, we will gain diplomatic leverage.
Iraqis will start seeing us as brokers, not occupiers. Iraq's
neighbors will face the reality that if they don't help with
stabilization, they will face the consequences of Iraq's collapse
-- including even greater refugee flows over their borders and
possible war.
</P>
<P>
The United States can facilitate Iraqi reconciliation and
regional cooperation by holding a conference similar to that
which brought peace to Bosnia. We will need regional security
negotiations among all of Iraq's neighbors and discussions of
donations from wealthy nations -- including oil-rich Muslim
countries -- to help rebuild Iraq. None of this can happen until
we remove the biggest obstacle to diplomacy: the presence of U.S.
forces in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
My plan is realistic because:
</P>
<P>
-- It is less risky. Leaving forces behind leaves them
vulnerable. Would we need another surge to protect them?
</P>
<P>
-- It gets our troops out of the quagmire and strengthens us for
our real challenges. It is foolish to think that 20,000 to 75,000
troops could bring peace to Iraq when 160,000 have not. We need
to get our troops out of the crossfire in Iraq so that we can
defeat the terrorists who attacked us on Sept. 11.
</P>
<P>
-- By hastening the peace process, the likelihood of prolonged
bloodshed is reduced. President Richard Nixon withdrew U.S.
forces slowly from Vietnam -- with disastrous consequences. Over
the seven years it took to get our troops out, 21,000 more
Americans and perhaps a million Vietnamese, most of them
civilians, died. All this death and destruction accomplished
nothing -- the communists took over as soon as we left.
</P>
<P>
My position has been clear since I entered this race: Remove all
the troops and launch energetic diplomatic efforts in Iraq and
internationally to bring stability. If Congress fails to end this
war, I will remove all troops without delay, and without
hesitation, beginning on my first day in office.
</P>
<P>
Let's stop pretending that all Democratic plans are similar. The
American people deserve precise answers from anyone who would be
commander in chief. How many troops would you leave in Iraq? For
how long? To do what, exactly? And the media should be asking
these questions of the candidates, rather than allowing them to
continue saying, "We are against the war ... but please don't
read the small print."
