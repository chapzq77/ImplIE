Leading Turkish human rights activist stands trial

ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP)
</P>
<P>
A leading human rights activist denied in court Thursday that she
advocated a separate Kurdish state when she used the word
``Kurdistan'' during a speech at a women's rights conference.
</P>
<P>
Eren Keskin, a lawyer and the head of the independent Human Rights
Association, faces up to three years in prison if found guilty of
charges of separatist propaganda for saying that ``women in Kurdistan
face harassment and rape the most'' during a speech she gave in
November 2001.
</P>
<P>
Keskin, who defended herself in the opening hearing of her trial
Thursday, said she had used the word ``Kurdistan'' to describe a
geographic region and not to refer to a state separate from Turkey.
</P>
<P>
``I advocate Turks and Kurds living together,'' she told the court.
</P>
<P>
The court adjourned trial until July 4.
</P>
<P>
As head of the human rights group, Keskin is frequently in court for
breaching Turkish laws that curb freedom of speech. She has some 90
cases pending against her for criticizing Turkey's human rights record
and treatment of its estimated 12 million Kurds.
</P>
<P>
Turkey fought a 15-year war against Kurdish rebels demanding autonomy
in the southeast and is sensitive toward the use of the word
``Kurdistan'' in describing Turkey's mainly Kurdish southeast region.
Many see it as an expression advocating the country's breakup.
</P>
<P>
The Kurdistan Workers' Party, or PKK, announced a unilateral cease-
fire in 1999. The government rejected the cease-fire and sporadic
fighting continues. About 37,000 people, mostly Kurdish rebels and
civilians, have been killed in the fighting since 1984.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, Turkey's parliament relaxed laws limiting freedom
of expression to boost the country's bid to join the European Union
but left laws dealing with separatism largely unchanged.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, an Ankara court on Tuesday acquitted an Islamic leader who
was jailed last year for claiming that an earthquake was God's revenge
against Turkey for its secular policies.
</P>
<P>
The court overturned the conviction of Mehmet Kutlular after his
lawyers argued that the case should be retried because of the changes
to Turkey's freedom of speech laws.
</P>
<P>
Kutlular served some nine months of a two-year sentence before he was
released early at the request of his lawyers, pending the new hearing.
