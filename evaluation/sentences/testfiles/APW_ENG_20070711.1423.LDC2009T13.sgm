A Chicago medical van driver accused by federal prosecutors of
funneling money to Mideast terrorists was sentenced Wednesday to
21 months in federal prison for lying in a civil lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
Muhammad Salah, 54, was also ordered to pay a $25,000
(euro18,200) fine and do 100 hours of community service.
</P>
<P>
"Telling the truth is the bedrock of our judicial system, and a
slap on the wrist will not provide a deterrent," U.S. District
Judge Amy St. Eve said in sentencing Salah.
</P>
<P>
Salah was convicted in February of lying under oath in a civil
lawsuit concerning the murder in Israel of a teenager by Hamas
terrorists.
</P>
<P>
The jury that convicted him also acquitted him of charges that he
participated in a racketeering conspiracy involving laundering
and delivering money to Hamas terrorists trying to topple
Israel's government.
</P>
<P>
St. Eve gave Salah until Oct. 11 to surrender to authorities and
begin serving his prison sentence.
