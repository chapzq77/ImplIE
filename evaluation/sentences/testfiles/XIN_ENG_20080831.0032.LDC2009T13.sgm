CAIRO, Aug. 31 (Xinhua)
</P>
<P>
Egyptian intelligence chief Omar Suleiman held talks on Sunday
with a delegation of the Popular Front for the Liberation of
Palestine (PFLP) on means to settle the current inter-Palestinian
crisis, the Egyptian MENA news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The PFLP delegation, led by its deputy secretary general Abdel-
Rehim Mallouh, briefed Suleiman its suggestions to restore the
Palestinian national unity, a well-placed Egyptian source was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The meeting tackled means to prepare the grounds for a
comprehensive Palestinian national dialogue, which the PFLP team
said should be based on the National Reconciliation Document and
the 2005 Cairo Declaration, said the source.
</P>
<P>
They also discussed the Egypt-brokered truce between the
Palestinians and Israel in and around the Gaza Strip and ways to
lift the siege on the Palestinian people.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, officials from the PFLP, the Democratic Front
for the Liberation off Palestine (DFLP) and the Popular Struggle
Front crossed into Egypt via Rafah crossing in southern Gaza
Strip.
</P>
<P>
Suleiman is expected to meet the delegations of the other two
Palestinian groups in the following days.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Suleiman held talks with the Palestinian Islamic Jihad
delegation, starting a series of bilateral talks with Palestinian
factions in order to hammer out a unified stance among
Palestinians to overcome the current inter- Palestinian crisis.
</P>
<P>
Following the bilateral meetings, Egypt will then oversee a
comprehensive Palestinian dialogue to help the Palestinians get
out of the current crisis and rifts among rival movements.
</P>
<P>
In the past months, Egypt has been trying to broker a Palestinian
reconciliation after it succeeded in brokering a ceasefire in
June between Israel and the Palestinian Hamas movement which
rules Gaza.
