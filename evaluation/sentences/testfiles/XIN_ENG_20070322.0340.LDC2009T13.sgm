Salvadoreans demand drinking water

MEXICO CITY, March 22 (Xinhua)
</P>
<P>
Thousands of Salvadoreans on Thursday marched to urge the
nation's legislature to pass laws granting them access to
drinking water in rural areas, on the occasion of World Water
Day, according to news reaching here.
</P>
<P>
In El Salvador, the rally, comprising peasants, social
organizations, unions and environmentalists, demanded that their
government prevent aquifer deterioration and protect water
sustainability and the right to water.
</P>
<P>
Damage to rivers "is resulting in poor quality for this vital
liquid that Salvadoreans in general consume," the organizers said
in a statement.
</P>
<P>
A recent United Nations Development Program (UNDP) report has
described the nation as "on the edge of water stress", with only
58 percent of the population having access to drinking water.
</P>
<P>
The UNDP said that bad management and technical and financial
problems has restricted access to clean water in a nation where
it rains three times more than the world average.
</P>
<P>
The organizers of the demonstration said the state-owned National
Aqueducts and Sewage Administration was suffering from rampant
chaos and disorder, adding that the nation is suffering because
water is considered as merchandise instead of a vital social
need.
</P>
<P>
Ramon Moran, a member of the Catholic organization Caritas,
demanded that the nation's legislature discuss a proposed law
presented by several communities a year ago, which has so far
been ignored.
