<P>
Former Burundian prime minister  Gabriel Mpozagara and his wife
were sentenced Monday to between a year and 15 months in jail for
keeping two of their nieces in slave-like conditions.
</P>
<P>
Mpozagara and his wife were each fined 10,000 euros (13,869
dollars) and ordered to pay 24,000 euros in damages and interest
to the elder of the two nieces, their lawyer Patrick Caillet told
AFP.
</P>
<P>
Caillet said the two young girls were kept in conditions
resembling child slavery between 1994 and 1999 at the couples'
plush home in the town of Ville d'Avray.
</P>
<P>
"They were kept in a cellar and lacked a proper toilet and were
given just a little water to wash themselves," he said.
</P>
<P>
The elder niece "was the maid and had to work seven days a week,
for between 16 and 17 hours daily, to attend to the tasks of the
couple and their six children," said anti-slavery body CCEM,
which took up the girls' case.
</P>
<P>
The two girls were brought to France in 1994 after the death of
their parents in Burundi's civil war. They were then aged nine
and 13.
</P>
<P>
The elder niece lodged a formal complaint five years later.
