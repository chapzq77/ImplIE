Rome would buy stakes in failing banks: Berlusconi
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The Italian government is prepared to buy stakes in failing banks
while waiving voting rights, Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi
said Wednesday as Rome sought to guarantee stability in Italy's
banking system.
</P>
<P>
"Eventual intervention will be carried out by the treasury, which
will buy shares but without voting rights," Berlusconi said after
an extraordinary cabinet meeting called to address the impact on
Italy of the global financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
"The management of banks remains private," said Finance Minister
Giulio Tremonti in televised remarks. "No one, and especially not
the government, has an interest in substituting for private
operators in the banking sector."
</P>
<P>
Berlusconi added that Italian banks had no liquidity problems and
that savers risked nothing.
</P>
<P>
The ANSA news agency reported earlier that the government might
decide to set aside 20 billion to 30 billion euros (27-41 billion
dollars) to support banks if they dip below a certain level of
solvency.
</P>
<P>
The fund would either help banks boost their liquidity or be used
to buy stakes in at-risk banks, ANSA said, quoting government
sources.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet's extraordinary meeting was called to adopt "urgent
measures" to guarantee stability in Italy's banking system.
</P>
<P>
Italy has been largely shielded from the knock-on effects of the
global financial crisis because its banking sector is mostly
retail, relying on ordinary savers' deposits for their business
rather than the short-term money markets.
</P>
<P>
However, leading bank UniCredit, which has the most foreign
exposure among Italian banks, has been hit hard on the Milan
stock market and is struggling to reassure investors about its
future.
