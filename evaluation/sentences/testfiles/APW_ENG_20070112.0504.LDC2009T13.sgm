Bollywood actor Saif Ali Khan's Italian girlfriend says she plans
to keep herself busy in India with social work, a TV talk show
and by trying to become a yoga instructor, a news report said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
"I didn't come to India just to be somebody's girlfriend and hang
out just like that," The Times of India newspaper quoted Rosa
Catalano as saying.
</P>
<P>
"I keep myself busy working for (non-governmental organizations).
I'm also doing a talk show on TV, and learning yoga to be an
instructor."
</P>
<P>
Khan is one of the most popular actors in India's Hindi film
industry.
</P>
<P>
Catalano denied Indian media reports that her relationship with
Khan has run into trouble.
</P>
<P>
"Unlike earlier, such reports don't upset me anymore. It's not
easy to break away from a relationship just like that," she said.
</P>
<P>
Catalano, who lives with the Bollywood star, also said she was
keen to tie the knot with Khan who is terribly busy with his
career now.
</P>
<P>
"Like every girl I also want to get married. Why don't you ask
Saif when? He will have the correct answer," she said.
</P>
<P>
The pair have been in a relationship since 2005 when Catalano
came to India.
</P>
<P>
The son of former Indian cricket captain Mansur Ali Khan Pataudi
and former film star Sharmila Tagore, Khan worked for many years
in Bollywood with limited success, before shooting to prominence
with major hits like "Dil Chahta Hai" (What the Heart Wants),
"Parineeta" (The Wife), "Hum Tum" (Me and You) and "Salaam
Namaste" (Hello, Hello) in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Khan separated in 2005 from his wife, fellow Bollywood actress
Amrita Singh, after 14-years of marriage. Their divorce
proceedings are underway.
