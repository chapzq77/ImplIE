Residents Return to Homes Near Yosemite Fire
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
About 100 residences outside the towns of Mariposa and Midpines
along Highway 140 remained off limits, but fire officials
expressed hope that people who live there could return soon.
</P>
<P>
"I think we are feeling good," said Suzanne Grin, a U.S. Forest
Service spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 4,500 firefighters continued to battle the Telegraph fire,
which claimed 21 homes and displaced thousands after it erupted a
week ago, ignited by a resident taking target practice near the
Merced River.
</P>
<P>
Grin said the blaze was 40 percent contained Thursday morning.
But authorities hoped that number would rise as the day wore on
and firefighters battled the last stubborn flames on the north
side of the nearly 34,000-acre fire.
</P>
<P>
The most threatened areas are the web of rural neighborhoods
arching down Greeley Hill along Highway 120.
</P>
<P>
More than two dozen helicopters and aerial tankers have been
dropping retardant on the northern edge of the fire while hand
crews and bulldozers constructed firebreaks and prepared for
possible back burns to halt the flames' advance.
</P>
<P>
Firefighters also have prevented the blaze from turning east and
heading farther up the Merced River canyon toward the town of El
Portal, which houses administrative buildings for Yosemite
National Park. The fire was eight miles from the town and a dozen
miles from the park's western entrance on Highway 140.
</P>
<P>
Adrienne Freeman, a park spokeswoman, said smoke that poured into
Yosemite Valley during the early days of the blaze has largely
dissipated and all air quality warnings have been lifted.
</P>
<P>
But with power lines into the park cut off by the fire, parts of
the valley remain without electricity while other buildings, such
as the visitor's center, are running on diesel-powered
generators.
</P>
<P>
Freeman said there is no estimate when repairs to the power lines
will be complete.
</P>
<P>
"It's just the reality of the whole situation," she said. "People
are dealing with it well. We've had an enormous incident
downstream, and we're adapting."
</P>
<P>
The only other hitch for Yosemite visitors has been occasional
road closures along Highway 140, the major entrance to the park,
when firefighters were working.
