Clinton Regains Footing

COLUMBUS, Ohio -- Hillary Rodham Clinton sidestepped political
disaster Tuesday night, winning the Ohio primary and remaining
neck-and-neck with Barack Obama in a Texas primary that was still
too close to call late Tuesday night, at least the caucus count.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's victories in Ohio and Rhode Island marked the latest
twist in a wildly unpredictable primary season -- and snapped a
12-state, 29-day losing streak. The victories gave her campaign
much needed momentum, even though they will do relatively little
to cut into Obama's 100-plus delegate lead.
</P>
<P>
"For every one who has ever been counted out but refused to be
knocked out, for every one who has stumbled but has stood right
back up this one's for you!" a jubilant Clinton as supporters
showed "Yes we can!" in a Columbus ballroom.
</P>
<P>
"As Ohio goes, so goes the nation," she added. "We're going on,
we're going strong and we're going all the way."
</P>
<P>
The former first lady led Obama by 57 percent to 41 percent with
63 percent of the precincts reporting at 11:15 p.m. Clinton held
a 50 percent to 49 percent lead in Texas with 39 percent of
precincts reporting.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, who enjoyed comfortable leads in both states as recently
as two weeks ago, also cut into Barack Obama's growing lead in
delegates. And earlier in the evening she broke her 29-day,
11-contest losing streak by winning the Rhode Island primary.
</P>
<P>
But Obama, who has enjoyed one of the great hot streaks in modern
political history, matched her, breezing to a two-to-one win in
Vermont. Despite the loss, Obama advisers declared he'd win the
nomination, claiming that the likelihood of her erasing his
100-plus lead in delegates is now nearly impossible with only 12
contests remaining.
</P>
<P>
The polls showed late-deciding voters in both states breaking
strongly for Clinton, reversing recent trends -- and possibly
indicating that Clinton's attacks on Obama's national security
record and his positions on NAFTA are taking hold.
</P>
<P>
Clinton lost most regions of Ohio to Obama but she dominated in
the heavily industrialized northeast, an area of white, blue-
collar, heavily Catholic towns and cities.
</P>
<P>
Advisers to Clinton said nothing in Tuesday's returns would cause
her to reconsider her campaign. One described her as "hell-bent"
to fight on through the April 22 Pennsylvania primary regardless
of the outcome in Texas.
</P>
<P>
"It's a long road to the nomination and I feel really good right
now," she told reporters during an early morning stop at a
polling station in an Hispanic section of Houston. "This is one
of the most civil and positive primary campaigns I can remember."
</P>
<P>
Clinton is planning rallies in Philadelphia and possibly
Pittsburgh Thursday, according to sources in her campaign.
</P>
<P>
Sleet and freezing rain in northern Ohio prompted a judge to
order 15 predominantly black precincts around Cleveland to stay
open for an additional 90 minutes. Clinton aides saw the move as
helping Obama, who was winning the state's African-American vote
by 85 percent to 15 percent, according to exit polls.
</P>
<P>
Voting in Texas, which has a complicated primary-caucus hybrid
system, went smoothly at first amid huge turnout. But the
caucuses, which used to select 35 percent of the state's
delegates, were marred by delays and late Tuesday the Clinton
campaign accused Obama workers of illegally pre-registering
caucus-goers in eight precincts.
</P>
<P>
An upbeat Clinton began a day of campaigning in Texas, where she
courted Hispanic voters in Houston and at a Mexican restaurant in
Dallas. Exit polls showed her with a two-to-one advantage among
Lone Star State Hispanics -- although Obama bested her among
Latinos age 18 to 29.
</P>
<P>
For a third straight day, a combative Clinton rebuffed calls by
Obama supporters and some party elders to pledge to drop out of
the race if she failed to scored decisive wins Tuesday. She was
buoyed by an ABC News poll showing that Americans supported her
remaining in the race by a two-to-one vote, provided she won
either Texas or Ohio.
</P>
<P>
"Never underestimate the intelligence of the voters," she said.
