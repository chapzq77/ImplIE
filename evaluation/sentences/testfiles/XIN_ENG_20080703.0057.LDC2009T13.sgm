Vietnam sees slowing population growth rate

HANOI, July 3 (Xinhua)
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's total fertility rate (TFR) was decreasing, indicating
the growth rate of population is slowing down, the Vietnam News
Agency reported here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Fertility rate refers to the number of births per women give. The
rate was 2.07 in 2007 in Vietnam, lowest since 1999 and marking a
0.2 drop from 2000, the agency cited officials from the United
Nations Population Fund as saying.
</P>
<P>
The rate was lower than Laos of 4.4 and Cambodia of 3.6.
</P>
<P>
It varies geographically within Vietnam, ranging from 2.8 in the
central highlands, to 1.7 in the southeastern regions. The
decrease is largely due to the increasing usage of contraceptive
methods, according to the fund.
</P>
<P>
Fewer women gave birth to a third child in 2007, dropping to 16.
7 percent from 18.5 percent in 2006 and 20.8 percent in 2005,
said the fund.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam is entering a so-called period of golden-population-
structure which refers to the time when young and working aged
people vastly outnumber dependants.   The focus of the population
policy now should be improving health and education services to
adolescents and youths who will constitute the primary labor
force in the next five to ten years, according to officials from
the fund.
