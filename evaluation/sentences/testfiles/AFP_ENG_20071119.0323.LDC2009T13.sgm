Bhutto says no immediate plans for Musharraf talks
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Former Pakistani premier Benazir Bhutto said Monday she had no
immediate plans to revive US-backed power-sharing talks with
President Pervez Musharraf amid the crisis over emergency rule.
</P>
<P>
At the same time her party withdrew a legal challenge to his re-
election as president, arguing it did not want to recognise the
new Supreme Court because it has been purged of most of its
previous judges.
</P>
<P>
Bhutto did not, however, categorically rule out talks in the
future and her words appeared to signal a slight shift in stance,
having last week called on Musharraf to quit.
</P>
<P>
"I have had no meeting with Musharraf and no such meeting is
scheduled," she told reporters in her power base in Karachi.
</P>
<P>
Her comments came after the United States called at the weekend
for Bhutto and Musharraf to resume the Western-backed
negotiations they had been holding before he imposed emergency
rule on November 3.
</P>
<P>
"We are not going back to the former track," she told reporters
earlier.
</P>
<P>
"I have made it clear that we are interested in a road map for
democracy, but we do not have the confidence that General
Musharraf's regime can give us that road map."
</P>
<P>
Bhutto was speaking after meeting US ambassador Anne Patterson.
</P>
<P>
It followed a weekend of face-to-face talks between US Deputy
Secretary of State John Negroponte and Musharraf and other senior
officials. The envoy also spoke to Bhutto by telephone.
</P>
<P>
Before leaving, Negroponte urged them to resume their dialogue
and for the military ruler to end the emergency, free political
prisoners, lift curbs on the media and ensure fair elections.
</P>
<P>
The United States has been jolted by the crisis engulfing its key
ally in the fight against Islamic militancy, and has eyed an
alliance of two moderate, pro- Western figures as a bulwark
against Al-Qaeda and the Taliban.
</P>
<P>
A close aide to Bhutto said that while she would not restart
talks as long as Musharraf had not ended the emergency and quit
as army chief, there was a possibility for dialogue afterwards.
</P>
<P>
He may resign as army chief later this week, after the Supreme
Court Monday dismissed five of six challenges to his re-election
as president.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the opposition leader seemed to have shut the door on
talks for good, saying "it is over with Musharraf" and vowing
never to work with him in government.
</P>
<P>
She also held talks with other opposition leaders on forging a
united front to try to force Musharraf from office.
</P>
<P>
But she pointedly declined to repeat her anti-Musharraf rhetoric
in a CNN interview Sunday, saying only, "Let's stop a moment and
see whether he first responds to Washington."
</P>
<P>
Bhutto also stressed Monday that Islamic extremism, with
militants making gains in Pakistan's northwest Swat valley, was
the biggest threat facing the country since it won independence
-- something Musharraf has also said.
</P>
<P>
Patterson told reporters as she left that she was meeting Bhutto
and other political leaders to press for free, fair and
transparent elections.
</P>
<P>
"The United States is interested in the reconciliation of all the
moderate political elements," she said.
</P>
<P>
"I am here to assure her and all others that we will do
everything possible to ensure that the election takes place."
