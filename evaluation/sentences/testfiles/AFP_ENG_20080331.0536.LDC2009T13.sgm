Bangladesh looks to India rice imports to ease price crunch
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bangladesh will import 400,000 tonnes of rice from India by the
end of May to sell below cost on the open market in a bid to ease
spiralling prices, an official said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The move comes amid reports that people have begun stockpiling
rice due to rocketing prices, which have doubled in the past year
and prompted a former government minister to warn of a "silent
famine" in the south Asian country.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh will pay 430 dollars per tonne for delivery of the
rice from India in the next two months, food secretary Molla
Wahiduzzaman said.
</P>
<P>
The shipments will boost the total amount of subsidised rice
available at government-run shops to 120,000 tonnes in April --
nearly triple what had been on offer before, Wahiduzzaman said.
</P>
<P>
Government outlets sell rice at 25 taka (36 cents) a kilogramme,
around 40 percent less than the market rate.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh and other Asian nations have been hit by record costs
for imported oil and food in the past year, which threatens to
hobble rapid export-oriented economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Rising food prices are a big concern for most people in
Bangladesh, where about 40 percent live on less than a dollar a
day and poor households spend nearly 70 percent of their income
on food.
</P>
<P>
Annual food inflation reached 16 percent in December here after
massive floods in July and August, and Cyclone Sidr in November,
which devastated rice and other crops.
</P>
<P>
The military-backed government, which came to power in January
2007, said the country would need to import more than three
million tonnes in the current financial year ending June because
of the crop damages.
</P>
<P>
Wahiduzzaman however said the imports from India were a buffer
and not an attempt to ease a food shortage, as the country has a
three-month stockpile on hand.
</P>
<P>
But government shops have stepped up subsidised sales of rice in
the main cities to meet soaring demand.
</P>
<P>
Independent economist Zaid Bakht said the government intervention
was "too little, too late" as people have started to hoard rice
fearing further price hikes.
</P>
<P>
"The government says it has enough stocks for the next three
months. Yet, the queues in front of government open-market sales
centres have been growing larger and larger. Some of the queues
are almost as long as a mile," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The magnitude and the intensity of the situation is severe. Tens
of millions of poor people have to cut their daily food intake or
are going hungry, as the food prices in the market are beyond
their reach," he said.
</P>
<P>
United Nations official Kemal Dervis, who visited the country
earlier this month, urged rich nations to increase food and
monetary aid to Bangladesh as it struggles to cope with rocketing
prices.
</P>
<P>
Early this month, ex-finance secretary Akbar Ali Khan said the
country was dealing with a "silent famine" due to high food
prices.
