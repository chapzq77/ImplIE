Anglicans to vote on issues regarding gays and lesbians
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The Church of England's assembly votes Wednesday on an issue that
has deeply divided the global Anglican Communion: how members
should interpret Scripture on sexuality.
</P>
<P>
Two motions, both of which regard lesbian and gay Christians,
will be considered at the General Synod, the parliament of the
Church of England, which is meeting this week to discuss church
business.
</P>
<P>
Neither motion, including one by a member of an evangelical
group, would change church law. But both seek to alter the
atmosphere of the debate.
</P>
<P>
The motions were put forward early last year, but they are widely
seen as a continuation of the last installment of the debate: a
meeting by Anglican leaders earlier this month in Tanzania, which
included Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams, spiritual
leader of the Church of England and the Anglican Communion.
</P>
<P>
The meeting ended by giving the Episcopal Church until Sept. 30
to pledge unequivocally not to consecrate another gay bishop or
approve an official prayer service for blessing same-sex couples.
If that promise is not made, the Episcopal Church could face a
much reduced role in the Anglican world.
</P>
<P>
The global Anglican Communion, including the U.S.-based
Episcopalians, has 77 million members, and they have spent years
debating how Scripture should be interpreted on salvation, truth
and sexuality.
</P>
<P>
In a speech to the General Synod in London on Monday, Williams
said: "The public perception, as we've been reminded by several
commentators in the last week or so, is that we are a church
obsessed with sex." He said, "It feels as though we are caught in
a battle very few want to be fighting."
</P>
<P>
Williams said that debate has included complex issues such as the
ordination of women as priests and same-sex relationships. But he
said they should not be allowed to divide the Anglican Communion.
</P>
<P>
"It is folly to think that a decision to `go our separate ways'
in the communion would leave us with a neat and morally
satisfying break between two groups of provinces, orthodox and
heretics or humane liberals and bigots -- depending on where you
stand," he said. "Every province could break in several different
directions."
</P>
<P>
The first motion -- put forward by the Rev. Mary Gilbert, and
supported by the liberal activist group Inclusive Church Network
-- asks the synod to "understand the nature of homosexual
orientation, and respect the patterns of holy living to which
lesbian and gay Christians aspire."
</P>
<P>
It says the synod should "agree that a homosexual orientation in
itself is no bar to a faithful Christian life."
</P>
<P>
The second motion, by the Rev. Paul Perkin, a member of the
evangelical group Reform, criticizes the Civil Partnership Act,
which came into force in Britain in late 2005 and gave legal
recognition to same-sex relationships and allowing gays to
virtually marry.
</P>
<P>
The motion asks the synod to express "deep concern" that the act
"undermines the distinctiveness and fundamental importance to
society of the relationship of marriage" and that the church's
bishops have "produced a recipe for confusion by not stating
clearly" that such civil partnerships would be inconsistent with
Christian teaching.
</P>
<P>
The motion also asks the bishops to investigate whether church
members who have formed civil partnerships are obeying the
teaching of the church, which says sexual relationships should be
confined to marriage.
</P>
<P>
In a statement two years ago, the bishops said they would not
inquire into the nature of the relationship between lay people in
civil partnerships, and that priests were not excluded from such
bonds.
