Polish massacre memorial postponed after 'exploitation' claims
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Poland's president postponed on Thursday memorial events marking
the Soviet massacre of soldiers in 1940 after concerns that
politicians could exploit them in the country's election
campaign.
</P>
<P>
Events in honour of 22,500 Polish prisoners of war slain by the
Soviet secret police in the notorious Katyn forest and other
sites had been set to begin on Friday, less than three weeks
before parliamentary elections on October 21.
</P>
<P>
They will now take place on November 11, which is also Poland's
independence day, said Ewa Junczyk-Ziomecka, a top aide to
President Lech Kaczynski.
</P>
<P>
Polish film director Andrzej Wajda, whose father was killed in
the massacres and who has just released a film about it called
simply "Katyn", called for a postponement in a letter in the
daily Gazeta Wyborcza on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Wajda, 81, said he was speaking out after learning that Katyn
victims including his father, Captain Jakub Wajda, were to
receive posthumous promotions.
</P>
<P>
"This promotion will be taking place during an electoral battle.
I don't want the death of my father, and the deaths of the
thousands of Polish officers exterminated in the Soviet Union, to
be exploited," Wajda said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Thursday, Prime Minister Jaroslaw Kaczynski, the
president's identical twin, had ruled out a postponement.
</P>
<P>
The Kaczynskis and their ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party have
regularly played the nationalist, anti-communist card against
Poland's liberal and left- wing opposition parties since coming
to power in 2005.
</P>
<P>
Lech Kaczynski decided to act because he believed the
"presidency's motives have been misinterpreted," Junczyk-Ziomecka
said.
</P>
<P>
"The ceremonies have been bundled with the election campaign,"
she said.
</P>
<P>
"President Kaczynski will not allow the victims and their
families to be treated like this," she added.
</P>
<P>
The Katyn massacre came in the wake of Moscow's deal with Nazi
Germany to invade and carve up Poland in 1939.
</P>
<P>
The Polish officers captured by the Red Army were deemed anti-
communist "counterrevolutionaries" and picked out to be killed by
the Soviet NKVD secret police.
</P>
<P>
The episode remained obscured for a long time, even when the
Nazis revealed the existence of the mass graves which they
discovered in 1941 after they invaded the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
Moscow blamed the Germans for the massacre, and the West remained
silent so as not to antagonise the Soviet Union, then a valuable
ally in the fight against Hitler.
</P>
<P>
The subject remained taboo under Poland's post-war communist
regime.
</P>
<P>
It was only in 1990 that then Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev
admitted his country's responsibility.
</P>
<P>
Wajda won an honorary Oscar in 2000 for his lifetime's work,
including "Kanal" (1957) and "Czlowiek z zelaza" (Man of Iron,
1981).
