KHARTOUM, Oct. 17 (Xinhua)
</P>
<P>
Egypt reiterated on Wednesday its concern over the crisis in the
Sudanese government aroused by the former southern rebel
movement's suspension of its participation in the government.
</P>
<P>
During a visit to Sudan Wednesday, an Egyptian delegation led by
Foreign Minister Ahmed Aboul Gheit and intelligence chief Omar
Suleiman delivered a message by President Hosni Mubarak to
Sudanese President Omer al-Bashir.
</P>
<P>
"The message of President Mubarak reflects his concern and that
of Egypt and its people with the affairs of Sudan and its desire
and hope for strong and united Sudan," the Egyptian foreign
minister told reporters at the end of a meeting with al-Bashir.
</P>
<P>
He said that the message also dealt with the bilateral relations
between the two countries as well as the stances of Egypt and its
concern with realization of peace and stability in Sudan.
</P>
<P>
The meeting at the Presidential Guest House in Khartoum followed
a short visit of the Egyptian delegation to Juba, the capital of
southern Sudan, where they held talks with Sudanese First Vice
President and Chairman of the former rebel Sudan People 's
Liberation Movement (SPLM) Salva Kiir Mayardit and other senior
SPLM officials.
</P>
<P>
After the meetings in both Khartoum and Juba, the Egyptian
foreign minister said that they were greatly encouraged as "they
feel the two sides, the SPLM and the National Congress Party
(NCP), are working to maintain contacts and full implementation
of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA)."
</P>
<P>
NCP is the ruling Sudanese political party led by al-Bashir, who
signed the CPA with the SPLM in 2005 to end a 21-year conflict
between them, which has constituted the longest civil war in the
African continent.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, SPLM decided to withhold the participation of the
movement's ministers in the central government and freeze the
partnership between the SPLM and the NCP until pending issues
between them were settled.
</P>
<P>
This is the most serious political crisis for the Sudanese
government of national unity since it was established in
September, 2005, in which the political power is shared between
the SPLM and the NCP.
