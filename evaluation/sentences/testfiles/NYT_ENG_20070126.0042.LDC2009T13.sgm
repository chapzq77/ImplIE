PRESIDENTIAL ROLE MODELS, MOLDED IN HOLLYWOOD
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK
</P>
<P>
Hollywood and national politics scrambled for our attention this
week. They drew special interest from some in this city, graced
as it now is with almost as many potential presidential
candidates as Naomi Campbell has tantrums.
</P>
<P>
Normally, New York is ignored in presidential elections (except
when candidates need cash), but it is in the thick of things this
time.
</P>
<P>
Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton has entered the race. Former Mayor
Rudolph W. Giuliani seems ready to follow. Former Gov. George E.
Pataki entertains the fanciful notion that he could be the chosen
one. Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg hears advice that he and his
billions should go for it. And the ever-running Rev. Al Sharpton
used the royal "we" to hint that he still has game. "We clearly
have a reason to run," he said two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
While presidential politics swirled in the winter air, the
Academy Awards people reminded everyone what is truly important
by announcing this year's nominations. People had movies on the
brain, Clinton among them. Letting the conversation begin on her
Web site, she took a question about her screen favorites.
</P>
<P>
She had three, she said, from different stages of her life: "The
Wizard of Oz," "Casablanca" and "Out of Africa."
</P>
<P>
Let's see. "The Wizard of Oz" is about a girl trying to get back
home -- to a white house, wasn't it? The hero in "Casablanca"
warns, "Either lay off politics or get out." And, at the risk of
squeezing a long-wrung-out subject, "Out of Africa" is about a
woman with a husband described in a 1985 review as "an ebullient,
unashamed philanderer."
</P>
<P>
We're guessing that Clinton chose those splendid films for
different reasons.
</P>
<P>
Presumably, the other politicians have their own favorites. A
spokeswoman for Giuliani said she did not know what his were. But
the former mayor said years ago that "The Godfather" topped his
list, and one of his shticks was to do a raspy Don Corleone
imitation. (If Giuliani does announce his candidacy, he could
stay true to form by saying, "Just when I thought that I was out,
they pull me back in.")
</P>
<P>
Bloomberg allowed to a couple of scribblers one night that his
cinematic tastes run along the lines of "National Lampoon's
Animal House." As for the others, "The Man Who Would Be King" is
a suitable title for Sharpton, and Pataki could make do with a
1970s British film called "Who?"
</P>
<P>
To the degree that movies shape perceptions of the world, the New
Yorkers who are goggle-eyed about the White House could do worse
than to study presidents in film. Forget biopics. We're talking
about fictional characters worthy of emulation -- and in movies
only. So, "West Wing" fans, that rules out the estimable Josiah
Bartlet.
</P>
<P>
Some film presidents can safely be eliminated as role models.
None of our New York contenders are likely to take cues from the
corrupt Dan Aykroyd in "My Fellow Americans," the morally
deficient Donald Moffat in "Clear and Present Danger," the
murderous Gene Hackman in "Absolute Power," the bullying and
lecherous Billy Bob Thornton in "Love Actually," or the wimpy
Ronny Cox in "Murder at 1600."
</P>
<P>
But they might want to think about the guts that Charles Durning
showed in "Twilight's Last Gleaming" (even though he does end up
dead). Wouldn't every president want to snarl something like "Get
off my plane" to a terrorist, as Harrison Ford did in "Air Force
One"? Jeff Bridges showed in "The Contender" that a president can
have both a cast-iron stomach and a steely backbone.
</P>
<P>
Best film president of all time? Some are partial to Henry Fonda
in "Fail-Safe." But we don't see the New Yorkers modeling
themselves on someone who nuked our city because of a teeny
mistake like an American plane's dropping the bomb on Moscow.
</P>
<P>
Our vote, for what it's worth, goes to Morgan Freeman in "Deep
Impact." It's not a great film, but he is a most admirable
president -- thoughtful and reassuring, but tough when the
hardest of decisions must be made.
</P>
<P>
It's something for the contenders from New York to consider. Or
would you rather that they draw inspiration from mobsters, frat
house louts and characters in search of brains, heart and
courage?
