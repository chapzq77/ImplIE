SPACE DOCKING, WITH WOMEN AT THE HELM OF BOTH CRAFTS

<P>
A hug on Thursday between the commanders of the space shuttle
Discovery and the International Space Station marked the first
time that women have served in both roles at the same time.
</P>
<P>
Led by the shuttle commander, Pamela A. Melroy, and the station
commander, Peggy A. Whitson, the crews met with shouts of
greeting and hearty embraces as the two vehicles made their way
around the earth at 17,000 mph, crossing over North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
The shuttle docked with the space station at 8:40 a.m. Eastern
time after it was put through a back flip to allow astronauts on
the station to shoot pictures of its belly. Analysts on the
ground study the pictures for any signs of damage from debris
during liftoff.
</P>
<P>
The back flip is a maneuver that is now part of every shuttle
mission to the space station. It was begun after the loss of the
shuttle Columbia and its crew in 2003 in an accident traced to
damage by debris during the launching.
</P>
<P>
In an interview before the mission, Melroy, who is a retired Air
Force colonel, said that performing the back flip so close to the
station -- just 600 feet away -- was counterintuitive for a
pilot.
</P>
<P>
"It certainly unsettled all of us when it was first discussed,"
she said. "I mean, it's kind of: 'Turn my back on the airplane?
When I'm flying formation with it? I don't think so."'
</P>
<P>
But time in the simulator made the pilots comfortable with the
idea, the commander said. "It becomes completely obvious why it
is safe to do," she said. "And it's OK."
</P>
<P>
In fact, she added, "I'm actually having fun with it."
</P>
<P>
Experts are still analyzing the pictures from the back flip and
other sources of data on the ascent, and "they have not seen
anything that would cause them concern at this time," John
Shannon, the chairman of the mission management team, said in an
afternoon briefing with reporters.
</P>
<P>
Just before the crew day officially ended, astronaut Dominic A.
Antonelli called Discovery from mission control to tell Melroy
that they had preliminarily decided that the shuttle came through
its ascent with so little damage that they will probably not call
for the "focused inspection" that would occur midway through the
flight and which requires more than three hours.
</P>
<P>
"Oh, man, that is fantastic news!" Melroy exclaimed over the
radio link. "It's obviously been a question that's very much on
our minds."
</P>
<P>
She said, "We're pretty excited to hear about that" and added
that it would give her team more time to work with the Harmony
module. "We just can't wait to get inside," she said.
</P>
<P>
The docking began 10 days of intense and challenging activity on
the 14-day mission, starting with work on Friday to install
Harmony, the first new living space for the station in six years.
In addition, an enormous solar array and truss will be moved into
their permanent position.
</P>
<P>
"I told my team before we started this mission, 'This is the kind
of mission we came to NASA for,"' Shannon said. "This is why
we're here."
