A Canadian company says it will open a large mine in western
Guyana after discovering vast gold deposits.

<P>
Guyana Goldfields Inc. says it found reserves of 2.5 million troy
ounces (78 million grams) and expects the mine to be profitable
for 12 years. Guyana is among the world's top 30 gold producers
and officials say the mine will be among the 10 largest in South
America.

Prime Minister Samuel Hinds said Thursday the discovery boosts a
thriving mining industry. Miners last year produced a record
246,000 troy ounces (7.7 million grams) of gold, up 30 percent
from the previous year.

Gold is one of Guyana's top exports.
