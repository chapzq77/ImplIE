Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said Wednesday Congress would
make a "huge mistake" if it fails to reinforce economic gains in
Peru and Colombia by rejecting free trade agreements that U.S.
officials have negotiated with the two countries.
</P>
<P>
"We need to realize how far these partners of ours have come, and
what trade agreements will mean for their people," Rice said in
remarks prepared for a gathering of business leaders.
</P>
<P>
But many Democrats are wary of bilateral trade agreements and may
be in no mood to do favors for Colombia because of allegations
that rightist paramilitary groups have penetrated the Colombian
government.
</P>
<P>
In Bogota, Vice President Francisco Santos said Tuesday his
country "might need to re-evaluate its relationship with the
United States" if the trade pact is jettisoned.
</P>
<P>
The fate of the agreement was the key issue on Tuesday during
discussions in Bogota involving visiting U.S. Deputy Secretary of
State John Negroponte and Colombian officials.
</P>
<P>
Rice said that just five years ago, Peru was still reeling from a
legacy of destructive economic policies, while Colombia "teetered
on the brink of failure. The government didn't even control large
parts of its own territory. Now things are changing."
</P>
<P>
Peruvian President Alan Garcia and Colombian President Alvaro
Uribe are pursuing policies that are lifting large numbers of
people out of poverty and into the formal economy, Rice said.
</P>
<P>
"And when they visited last week, these two democratic leaders
asked America for one thing above all else -- to deliver the
trade agreements that we negotiated with them," she said.
</P>
<P>
Uribe was welcomed warmly by President George W. Bush and other
administration officials. But the leader of the House of
Representatives, Speaker Nancy Pelosi, issued a statement
critical of Colombia after she and Democratic colleagues met with
Uribe.
</P>
<P>
The statement made no reference to the free trade deal and
expressed "growing concerns" about allegations of connections
between rightist paramilitaries and Colombian officials.
</P>
<P>
Rice, in her remarks Wednesday, noted that Panama is also
awaiting congressional approval of a trade agreement.
</P>
<P>
She said would be "huge mistake not to extend trade agreements to
responsible democratic governments like Panama, Peru and
Colombia."
