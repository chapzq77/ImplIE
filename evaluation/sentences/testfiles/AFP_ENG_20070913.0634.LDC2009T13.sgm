Cricket: Chappell says Australians complacent, lack respect
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Former Australian captain Ian Chappell said Ricky Ponting's side
was complacent and lacked respect for its opposition Thursday
after a shock loss to minnows Zimbabwe in the Twenty20 world cup.
</P>
<P>
Australia's World Cup and Test champions limped to 138 for nine
in the opening match of their campaign in South Africa, only for
Zimbabwe to overhaul the total with one ball to spare in a
thrilling match.
</P>
<P>
Chappell, a gritty Australian captain in the 1970s who never lost
a Test series as skipper, said the Ponting's side could not use a
long lay-off from the game as an excuse.
</P>
<P>
"I think it's more likely the Australians were complacent than
rusty," Chappell told the CricInfo website.
</P>
<P>
Chappell said the Australians had played plenty of practice
matches in the lead- up to the tournament opener and Ponting
would be disappointed his players did not treat their unfancied
opponents with more respect.
</P>
<P>
"I think there could have been a feeling of 'all we've got to do
is turn up and we'll beat Zimbabwe'," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I think that's what Ricky Ponting was alluding to when he said
after the game that his players need to respect the (Twenty20)
game a little."
</P>
<P>
Chappell said Ponting probably delivered a "tongue lashing" to
his team after the loss.
</P>
<P>
He also warned Australia's next opponents, England, to expect a
backlash.
</P>
<P>
"England will need to watch out when Australia play them because
they'll be wounded," he said.
</P>
<P>
"On a minor scale, it will be a little bit like when Australia
lost the Ashes to them in 2005."
</P>
<P>
Australia bounced back from that loss to thrash England 5-0 in
the next Ashes Test series.
</P>
<P>
Australia's loss came too late to make the newspapers Down Under
but their online editions blasted Ponting's men.
</P>
<P>
"Zimbabwe beats awful Australia," lamented Sydney's Daily
Telegraph, while the Australian newspaper's website described the
national team's performance as "embarrassing."
</P>
<P>
"Ostracised Zimbabwe stun Ponting's men," said the Sydney Morning
Herald, pointing out that Australia were in real danger of
crashing out of the tournament.
</P>
<P>
Cricket Australia's official website, cricket.com.au, described
the loss as "one of cricket's great shocks."
