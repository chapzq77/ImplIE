US regulator extends short-sell ban for financials

WASHINGTON 2008-10-02 01:47:13 UTC

<P>
Federal regulators on Wednesday extended an unprecedented ban
against all short-selling in the shares of more than 800
financial companies, keeping it in place at least until after
Congress enacts a massive financial bailout plan.
</P>
<P>
The Securities and Exchange Commission announced the extension of
the ban, which was put in on Sept. 18 in a bid to shore up
investor confidence in the face of the spiraling market crisis.
</P>
<P>
The ban, which was to expire Thursday, now will last until the
third business day after enactment of the $700 billion financial
bailout plan now before Congress. It will end no later than Oct.
17.
</P>
<P>
Late Wednesday, the Senate passed the bailout plan, which
appeared to be gaining ground in the House of Representatives,
where Republican opposition softened.
</P>
<P>
The idea is that the extension will give enough time for
financial markets to calm, with the bailout program's plan to buy
up Wall Street's toxic mortgage debt possibly starting to have a
positive effect. By law, the SEC's emergency ban could not be
extended beyond Oct. 17.
</P>
<P>
In the days since the ban took effect, the stock market has been
on a rollercoaster ride. On Monday, the day the bailout plan was
rejected in the House, the market shot downward and sent the Dow
Jones industrials on a record 778-point plunge.
</P>
<P>
Short-sellers bet against a stock. The practice, which is legal
and widely used on Wall Street, involves borrowing a company's
shares, selling them, and then buying them when the stock falls
and returning them to the lender. The short-seller pockets the
difference in price.
</P>
<P>
Although short selling can make markets more efficient and bring
in more capital, regulators have maintained that it has widened
the scope of the financial crisis and contributed to the
collapsing values of investment- and commercial-bank stocks in
particular.
</P>
<P>
The SEC "has taken steps during recent weeks to address concerns
regarding short sales in light of the ongoing credit crisis," the
agency said in a statement issued Wednesday night. "The steps
(the SEC) has taken are designed to ensure the continued smooth
operation of orderly markets. Our actions have been taken in
consultation with regulators of the major developed securities
markets around the world, with whom we have coordinated in
monitoring market reactions."
