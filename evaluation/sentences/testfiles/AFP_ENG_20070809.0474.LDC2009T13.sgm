ETimor violence recalls independence: Ramos-Horta
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
East Timor's president Jose Ramos-Horta said Thursday that this
week's violence had recalled the nation's bloody independence
vote, as the new government began its first day in office.
</P>
<P>
Unrest surrounding East Timor's vote to break away from Indonesia
in 1999 led to the deaths of some 1,400 people and saw militias
allegedly backed by Indonesia's military lay waste to much of the
tiny nation.
</P>
<P>
Violence that erupted in Dili and several other towns on Monday
following the announcement of a new government headed by
independence hero Xanana Gusmao has not led to any deaths but
tensions have been running high.
</P>
<P>
"The violence against state property, civilians and the church
reminded us of the brutal actions of the militias in 1999,"
Ramos-Horta, a Nobel peace laureate, said in a speech to
lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
At least eight people, including four UN police, have been
injured in the mayhem, which has seen marauding gangs torch
buildings, pelt rocks at bystanders and set up threatening road
blocks.
</P>
<P>
Ramos-Horta said the perpetrators had "shown that they have no
understanding of Fretilin's role in the country's democracy and
have discredited Fretilin leaders."
</P>
<P>
The former ruling party Fretilin has disputed the legality of
Gusmao's government, which was appointed by the president after
June elections saw no party win the absolute majority to rule.
</P>
<P>
But it has said it will sit in opposition, though no lawmakers
turned up to parliament on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The party, which won the most number of seats in parliament but
was unable to cobble together a coalition to give it a majority,
has said it has called on its supporters to refrain from
violence.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Gusmao, who heads a coalition of four parties that
together hold 37 seats in the 65-seat parliament, heard the
speech along with other cabinet members sitting in the
legislature on their first day in office.
</P>
<P>
Gusmao's government has a massive task ahead to develop the
impoverished but oil- and gas-rich nation. Unemployment is at 50
percent, disaffected youth threaten social stability and the
health and education systems are in disarray.
