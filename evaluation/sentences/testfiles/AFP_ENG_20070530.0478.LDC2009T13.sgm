Tennis: Rocket-powered Venus sets new service mark
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Venus Williams warmed up a chilly French Open by sending down the
fastest serve ever recorded in a women's main draw match here on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Williams clocked 206 kmh (128mph) during her second round 6-1,
7-6 (10/8) win over compatriot Ashley Harkleroad on Court Suzanne
Lenglen.
</P>
<P>
"I loved it," said Williams whose record coincided with her
allowing Harkleroad back into the match from 2-5 down, and
holding match points, to having to fend off four set points when
she should have safely back in the locker room.
</P>
<P>
"That's where I lost my focus a little bit because I saw the 206.
I was so excited. When I was younger I was always trying to serve
harder and harder.
</P>
<P>
"Now that I'm not trying to serve hard, it comes hard. It was
unexpected," added Williams who registered the new mark in the
fifth game of the second set when she was leading 4-1.
</P>
<P>
Williams set the old mark of 204kmh (127mph) in 1998 in a
quarter-final win against Mary Pierce in Zurich which was broken
by Dutch veteran Brenda Schultz- McCarthy who hit a serve of
209kmh (130mph) in Cincinnati last July.
</P>
<P>
However, that came in the qualifying competition.
</P>
<P>
Williams, the 26th seed, next faces either Serbian fourth seed
Jelena Jankovic or Colombia's Catalina Castano for a place in the
last 16.
