SCHUMER SAYS DEMOCRATIC SENATE CANDIDATES LEADING IN FIVE STATES
WITH GOP INCUMBENTS

WASHINGTON
</P>
<P>
Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., the leader of Democratic Party
efforts to gain Senate seats in the Nov. 4 elections, said
Wednesday that polls show Democratic candidates leading in five
states with incumbent Republican senators.
</P>
<P>
Schumer said polls indicate that his party's candidates are ahead
in Virginia, New Mexico, Colorado, New Hampshire and Alaska,
states now held by Republican senators.
</P>
<P>
Democratic candidates are also doing well in their Senate races
in North Carolina and Oregon, Schumer said, and are close in
Mississippi, Minnesota, Georgia and Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
"We're doing extremely well in places we didn't expect to do
well," Schumer, chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign
Committee, told reporters on Wednesday, though he declined to
predict how many seats he expects the party to win in November.
</P>
<P>
Schumer also maintained that it was "too early" to predict
whether his party would end up with the 60 seats needed to block
filibusters in the chamber.
</P>
<P>
"The wind is more strongly at our back than ever," Schumer said.
"We're doing better. Where it ends up, I don't know."
</P>
<P>
The DSCC raises and distributes campaign funds and recruits and
advises candidates.
</P>
<P>
Schumer criticized the Chamber of Commerce, which he termed "a
wing" of the Republican Senate campaign committee.
</P>
<P>
The business group has donated money almost exclusively to Senate
candidates, rather than House races or the presidential contest,
Schumer said. Schumer said the chamber has given over $16 million
to Republican candidates this year but only $329,000 to their
Democratic counterparts.
</P>
<P>
In a statement responding to Schumer, R. Bruce Josten, the
chamber's executive vice president of government affairs, said
the organization is "pro-growth and pro-jobs" and supports
candidates who work toward these aims.
</P>
<P>
"It's a shame that Sen. Schumer would try to turn our pro-jobs,
pro-growth agenda into a partisan issue for his campaign purposes
-- especially at a time when our nation needs leadership and
unity in Washington," Josten said. "The U.S. Chamber is focused
on eliminating barriers to economic growth.  To that end, we
support candidates and policies that will reduce government
waste, reduce taxes, and eliminate lawsuit abuse."
</P>
<P>
Democrats currently maintain a 51-49 advantage in the Senate -- a
count that includes two independents: Sen. Bernard Sanders,
I-Vt., and Sen. Joe Lieberman, I-Conn., who caucus with the
Democrats and thus provide the margin of control of the Senate.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-three of the 35 contested Senate seats on Nov. 4 are held
by Republicans.
</P>
<P>
The last time a party gained the 60 seats required to block a
filibuster was during the 95th Congress of 1977-1978, when the
Democratic Party controlled 61 seats.
