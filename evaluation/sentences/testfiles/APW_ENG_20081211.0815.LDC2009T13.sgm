Investors took a cautious stance on Wall Street Thursday, selling
stocks as they questioned whether a bill to rescue Detroit's
carmakers will pass the Senate.
</P>
<P>
The $14 billion of loans to cash-starved General Motors Corp. and
Chrysler LLC could go before the Senate as early as Thursday.
But, based on concerns raised by Republicans, and even some
uncertain support among Democrats, approval is not guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
Those opposed are arguing that any support for the domestic auto
industry should carry significant concessions from autoworkers
and creditors and reject tougher environmental rules imposed by
House Democrats. The House approved the plan late Wednesday on a
vote of 237-170 to infuse money within days to the two struggling
automakers. Ford Motor Co. has said it does not need aid.

The heads of the three automakers said that even one of the
companies going into bankruptcy would slam an already battered
economy with thousands of job losses. Meanwhile, the government
said Thursday initial claims for unemployment insurance jumped to
a 26-year high. The Labor Department said initial claims for
unemployment insurance rose to a seasonally adjusted 573,000,
from an upwardly revised 515,000 for the previous week. The
latest figure was significantly above analysts' estimates of
525,000, according to a survey by Thomson Reuters.

The Dow Jones industrial average fell 106.41, or 1.21 percent, to
8,655.01, while the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index shed 8.81, or
0.98 percent, to 890.43. The Nasdaq composite index fell 20.48,
or 1.31 percent, to 1,545.00
