At least 60 Myanmar immigrants rioted in a Malaysia detention
centre Monday, torching a building after failing to win asylum to
a third country, according to a news report.The group initially
gathered outside their block at a detention camp south of here
and tried to bring down the perimeter fence, local state police
chief Osman Abdullah was quoted as saying by the daily Star
newspaper website.

"The authorities tried talking to them but a short while later,
they turned violent and then gained entry into the office and set
it ablaze," he added.

Osman said about 200 police and security personnel were deployed
to bring the situation under control.

The Lenggeng detention facility houses 820 illegal immigrants, of
which 218 are from Myanmar, he said.

"We are still investigating the cause, but at this point in time
all I can say is that they were unhappy because they heard that
their application to a third country had been rejected," Osman
added.

Officials at the detention centre could not be reached for
comment.
