Alitalia steward calls for unions, Air France compromise on sale
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A steward at flag carrier Alitalia extended his hunger strike to
a fourth day Monday as he called for unions and Air France-KLM to
return to talks and compromise on the sale of the struggling
airline.
</P>
<P>
"The unions are intransigent and Air France-KLM's takeover plan
is not totally satisfactory," steward Gianluca Morale told AFP.
</P>
<P>
They both should "take a step backwards" on their demands so as
to allow a compromise, said Morale, 45, who has worked for
Alitalia for 23 years.
</P>
<P>
Morale goes each day to Rome-Fiumicino airport and said that he
had not eaten for four days, although he was taking liquids and
was under the care of a doctor.
</P>
<P>
"Today, I have a headache but it seems that that is normal."
</P>
<P>
Talks between the unions and Air France-KLM broke down last
Wednesday on differences over the number of jobs that would have
to be cut as part of the deal for Alitalia, which is chronically
loss-making.
</P>
<P>
Air France-KLM in its initial plans wants 2,100 job cuts.
</P>
<P>
Both the outgoing Italian government and unions at Alitalia on
Thursday signalled they wanted Air France-KLM to return to the
negotiating table amid fears the airline would not be able to
keep going for long on its own.
