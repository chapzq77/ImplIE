Ecuador assembly approves ban on foreign military bases,
targeting US

QUITO, Ecuador 2008-04-02 20:38:11 UTC
</P>
<P>
The only U.S. military post in South America, an important drug-
interdiction center, would be banned under a clause written into
Ecuador's new constitution, which faces a referendum this year.
</P>
<P>
Leftist President Rafael Correa, whose party controls the
130-member assembly writing the new constitution, has repeatedly
said that he will not renew the 10-year U.S. lease in Ecuador's
Pacific port of Manta when it expires in late 2009.
</P>
<P>
The measure approved Tuesday states that "Ecuador is a land of
peace," and that "the presence of foreign military bases or
foreign installations with military purposes is prohibited."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. is the only foreign country with a military base in
Ecuador.
</P>
<P>
The surveillance flights the United States runs out of the base
are responsible for much of the anti-narcotics effort for the
eastern Pacific.
</P>
<P>
"Of course we're going to follow the line of the new constitution
if it is approved," said U.S. Ambassador in Quito Linda Jewell.
"We are going to talk with the government to see how we can
continue working in the fight against drug trafficking."
</P>
<P>
Ecuador produces very little cocaine, but is often used as a
transit country for drugs sent from neighboring Colombia and Peru
-- the world's top two cocaine producers -- to the United States.
</P>
<P>
The assembly, which first convened in late November, does not
have the power to alter current agreements between Ecuador and
foreign governments, assuring the U.S. can stay in Manta until
next year.
</P>
<P>
The body's charter will be put to a national referendum in
mid-2008.
