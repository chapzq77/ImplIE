Strike increases game-show allure

Reality TV shows aren't the only thing to look forward to this
winter. Game shows are the other choice.
</P>
<P>
One such offering is Fox's new game show "The Moment of Truth,"
which debuts 9 p.m. Jan. 23. Participants will be put to the test
-- the lie detector test -- to reveal whether or not they are
being honest for a chance to win $500,000.
</P>
<P>
First, contestants must answer 21 increasingly personal questions
honestly, as determined by a polygraph, to which they are
attached prior to the game.
</P>
<P>
At any time, between the polygraph and the televised game,
participants can change their answers or walk away from the
competition and forfeit the big cash payout. To win, the
contestant must fess up to every one of her personal revelations
knowing that the truth could spark shock and disappointment in
her relatives and friends and cause public embarrassment on
national television.
</P>
<P>
If the Pinocchio motif of "The Moment of Truth" doesn't pique
your interest, the current nine-week Writers Guild of America
strike ensures the production of two returning game shows that
don't use writers to fill in the broadcast network's programming
holes:
</P>
<P>
"Power of 10" (8 p.m. Wednesdays on CBS, Channel 62): Drew Carey
pulls double duty -- he also hosts "The Price Is Right" in the
day -- and fronts this summer-time favorite where contestants
guess at the mindset of American pollsters, "Family Feud" style,
for a shot at the $10 million top prize.
</P>
<P>
"1 vs. 100" (8 p.m. Fridays on NBC, Channel 4): Contestants face
off with a mob of 100 to correctly answer a number of trivia
questions. Comedian Bob Saget hosts.
