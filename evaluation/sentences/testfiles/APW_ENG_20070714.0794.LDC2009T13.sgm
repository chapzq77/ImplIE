Fourth-seeded Fabrice Santoro defeated Wesley Moodie, 7-6 (2),
6-3, on Saturday to set up the first all-French final in the
31-year history of the Hall of Fame Tennis Championships.
</P>
<P>
Santoro will face No. 5 seed Nicolas Mahut, who beat Dick Norman,
6-4, 6-7 (2), 6-2, in the opening semifinal earlier Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"A good day for the French. A good week so far," Santoro said.
"We warmed up together this morning and we said it would be nice
if we played the final together."
</P>
<P>
Santoro, who relied on two-handed cuts, slices and well-placed
lobs, completed the victorious pairing for the French on Bastille
Day when he closed out Moodie at love in the final game. It's his
first final since 2002 in Dubai, where he won his fourth ATP
title.
</P>
<P>
"His nickname is the magician," Mahut said of his countryman.
"Everybody knows he plays the right shots."
</P>
<P>
Before the semifinals, Pete Sampras highlighted the induction of
this year's Hall of Fame class that included Arantxa Sanchez-
Vicario, Sven Davidson and Russ Adams during a ceremony on the
Hall's grass courts.
</P>
<P>
Mahut, a winner in 10 of 12 matches, advanced to his second
career final. He lost the other to Andy Roddick at London-Queens
Club last month.
</P>
<P>
"I know it's very painful to lose in the finals," he said. "I
don't want to do that."
</P>
<P>
In the first semi, Mahut broke Norman in the fourth game of the
third set to go up 3-1. He closed out the fifth and seventh games
with aces, taking a 5-2 edge.
</P>
<P>
Norman fell behind 15-40 in the final game before his backhand
drop shot hit the top of the net and fell to the ground, ending
the match.
</P>
<P>
Mahut adjusted his thinking after losing the tiebreaker.
</P>
<P>
"I was saying, 'Be more aggressive in my serve.' At the end of
the second set I was very relaxed," he said. "I don't know why"
</P>
<P>
Norman played in the first semifinal of his 15-year career.
