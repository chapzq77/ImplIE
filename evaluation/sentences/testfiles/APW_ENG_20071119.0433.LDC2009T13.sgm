Olmert proposes limited freeze on West Bank settlements
</HEADLINE>

JERUSALEM 2007-11-19 11:29:17 UTC

<P>
Prime Minister Ehud Olmert on Monday told his Cabinet that Israel
would not build any new settlements in the West Bank, but stopped
short of American demands to freeze construction in existing
communities before a crucial Mideast conference.
</P>
<P>
Olmert will be traveling to Egypt on Tuesday to meet with
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak ahead of a key Arab League
meeting where member states will decide whether to attend the
U.S.-sponsored meeting next week and demonstrate their support
for renewed peace moves.
</P>
<P>
A settlement freeze and a related dismantling of settlement
outposts that Olmert also promised are key aspects of the "road
map," a U.S.-backed peace plan that stalled shortly after its
inception in 2003. The U.S. has been trying to revive the road
map ahead of the peace conference, which is expected to take
place in Annapolis, Maryland.
</P>
<P>
"Let's be straight, we committed ourselves in the road map not to
build new settlements and we will not build any," Olmert was
quoted as saying by his spokeswoman, Miri Eisin.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian officials reacted coolly to Olmert's statement, which
came shortly before a meeting later in the day with Palestinian
President Mahmoud Abbas. The two leaders have been meeting
frequently to lay the groundwork for the U.S. conference, and one
Palestinian negotiator said there were "serious problems" in the
preparations.
</P>
<P>
Olmert has been under American pressure to make goodwill gestures
to Abbas, including a settlement freeze and a large-scale release
of Palestinian prisoners, ahead of next week's summit.
</P>
<P>
Olmert asked his Cabinet on Monday to release release 450
Palestinian prisoners before the meeting -- a far smaller number
than the Palestinians had sought. The proposal was expected to
pass.
</P>
<P>
At the summit, Israel and the Palestinians hope to renew formal
peace talks, which broke down in violence seven years ago. The
U.S. also hopes the gathering will give an international boost to
Abbas in his power struggle against the Hamas militant group,
which now controls the Gaza Strip. However, preparations have run
into trouble.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians want the conference to address issues at the
heart of the conflict with Israel, such as the borders of a
future Palestinian state, shared sovereignty over disputed
Jerusalem and the fate of Palestinian refugees. Israel says the
summit should be a launching pad for peace talks, with
discussions on core issues to follow.
</P>
<P>
"The negotiations will start after Annapolis and it will be very
intensive, very serious," Olmert told reporters at the beginning
of the Cabinet meeting. "It will deal with all the core issues
that are a part of the process that has to lead for two nation
states for two nations."
</P>
<P>
Amid the disagreements, the U.S. has not announced an official
date or invitation list for the summit.
</P>
<P>
"We have serious, serious problems," Palestinian negotiator Saeb
Erekat said, urging more American involvement.
</P>
<P>
Abbas said he hoped his meeting with Olmert in Jerusalem would
yield progress.
</P>
<P>
"We want to continue our talks regarding the preparation for
Annapolis, and we need to hear from him (Olmert) things that will
satisfy us, so we can go to Annapolis on a solid basis," Abbas
told reporters.
</P>
<P>
The road map is a phased peace plan that calls for the
establishment of an independent Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
Its first stage calls on Israel to freeze all settlement
construction and remove dozens of unauthorized settlement
outposts built since 2001 -- steps that were never taken. The
plan also requires the Palestinians to crack down on militants.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians say they've been carrying out their obligations
-- something Israel disputes -- and want Israel to do the same.
</P>
<P>
Erekat said Olmert's gesture fell far short of Israel's
commitments. He noted that a string of Israeli leaders have
maintained that Israel should be allowed to build in existing
settlements to account for "natural growth."
</P>
<P>
"He omitted from the Israeli obligation in the road map that the
Israeli government must freeze all settlement activity, including
natural growth," Erekat said. "Either it's a 100 percent
settlement freeze or no settlement freeze. There is nothing in
the middle."
</P>
<P>
Some 270,000 Israelis live in the West Bank, in addition to
roughly 180,000 Jews living in east Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians claim both areas, which Israel captured in the
1967 Mideast war, for part of their future state.
</P>
<P>
Israel has built no new authorized settlements in nearly a
decade.
</P>
<P>
Olmert has signaled he is ready to relinquish large areas of the
West Bank and parts of east Jerusalem. But he also hopes to
retain large settlement blocs in the West Bank and key areas in
east Jerusalem, including Jewish, Christian and Muslim holy
sites.
</P>
<P>
Olmert's office, meanwhile, said he would make a one-day visit to
Egypt on Tuesday to discuss summit preparations.
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials are hoping for a large turnout for the conference,
including moderate Arab countries like Saudi Arabia that do not
have relations with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Foreign ministers of 12 Arab countries are due to meet with Abbas
at the Arab League in Cairo on Friday to forge an Arab strategy
on the conference.
</P>
<P>
In a boost for peace efforts, international Mideast envoy Tony
Blair said Israel and the Palestinians would announce on Monday a
number of economic projects that could create tens of thousands
of jobs for Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Among the projects will be a Turkish-sponsored industrial park in
the southern West Bank, a sewage project in northern Gaza and
road construction in the West Bank, a Palestinian official said.
