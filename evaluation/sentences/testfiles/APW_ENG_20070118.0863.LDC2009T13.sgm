Yushchenko says he intends to veto bill weakening his powers

KIEV, Ukraine 2007-01-18 13:13:34 UTC

<P>
Ukrainian President Viktor Yushchenko notified parliament on
Thursday that he intends to veto a bill that would weaken the
powers of the presidency in this ex-Soviet republic.
</P>
<P>
Yushchenko's announcement suggests the increasingly sidelined
leader is preparing to take a harder stance in his escalating
power struggle with Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovych.
</P>
<P>
Yushchenko vetoed the Cabinet bill once, but parliament overrode
his veto last Friday. Under the country's constitution, the
president had two weeks to sign the measure into law -- if he
refuses, the parliament speaker could bypass him and sign it.
</P>
<P>
But Yushchenko's office appeared to have found a loophole
Thursday, noting that the measure passed Friday differed slightly
-- on one page -- from the law Yushchenko already vetoed.
</P>
<P>
"Consequently, the head of state ... may use his right to veto
the corresponding law," the president's office said.
</P>
<P>
The Cabinet bill was supposed to help clarify the division of
power between the president's office and the premier's Cabinet,
but Yushchenko complained that instead it just disrupted the
balance of power, giving more to Yanukovych.
</P>
<P>
Under the measure, Yushchenko would see his right to appoint the
foreign and defense ministers limited, and his influence over
regional leaders weakened.
</P>
<P>
Yushchenko had proposed 42 changes to the measure, but parliament
rejected all of his suggestions. Yushchenko has also said
Ukraine's Constitutional Court must consider whether the bill
violates the Constitution.
