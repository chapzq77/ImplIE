Barak sworn-in Israel's new defence minister
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Israel's new Defence Minister Ehud Barak was sworn in by
parliament on Monday, following his political comeback as new
Labour party chairman and Hamas's violent takeover of the Gaza
Strip.
</P>
<P>
Parliament endorsed the appointment with 46 votes for and 22
against, before Barak was sworn in. The cabinet had unanimously
approved his nomination as defence minister and deputy premier in
a telephone vote on Friday,
</P>
<P>
Barak's appointment, made earlier than expected, was "because of
the new situation that has evolved," one official said, alluding
to the dramatic and bloody takeover of the Gaza Strip by the
Palestinian Islamist movement Hamas.
</P>
<P>
And on Sunday, militants based in Lebanon fired rockets into
Israel for the first time in 10 months, without causing
casualties.
</P>
<P>
Barak replaces outgoing defence minister Amir Peretz, who lost
the Labour party leadership last month and who was heavily
criticised as having failed on the job by a partial government
inquiry into last year's Lebanon war.
</P>
<P>
"The Lebanon war brought to light failings and mistakes dating
back several years, for which I had no responsibility but I paid
the price," Peretz, who is now leaving the government for the
back benches, told parliament.
</P>
<P>
Barak, a former chief of staff and defence minister, was last
week elected to head Labour -- Olmert's main coalition partner --
staging a spectacular comeback to the national political arena
after a more then six-year absence.
</P>
<P>
The 65-year-old, who is Israel's most decorated soldier, retired
from public life in the wake of the failed Camp David peace talks
with the Palestinians in 2000 which led to the outbreak of the
second Palestinian uprising in September.
