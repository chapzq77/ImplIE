UTILITIES DUMP COAL PLANT
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TALLAHASSEE  Under pressure from Gov. Charlie Crist, a consortium
of Florida utilities pulled the plug Tuesday on another
controversial coal-fired power plant because of concerns about
global warming.
</P>
<P>
"It's like a new day is dawning for energy in Florida," said
Susan Glickman of the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy, which
opposed the plant.
</P>
<P>
Crist announced the demise of the coal plant during a news
conference unveiling the agenda of his global warming summit in
Miami next week, where he promised to "identify specific actions"
that Florida can take to combat climate change.
</P>
<P>
"Good things are happening," Crist said. "That pleases me, and I
think it pleases our fellow Floridians."
</P>
<P>
Last month the Public Service Commission short-circuited a
proposal by Florida Power &amp;amp; Light to build a 960-megawatt
coal-fired plant near Everglades National Park. The PSC based its
vote in part on concerns about the cost of cleaning up the
plant's greenhouse gas emissions.
</P>
<P>
Now the four utilities involved in building the 800-megawatt
Taylor Energy Center in the state's Big Bend area have dropped
their plans for that coal plant as well, saying they will "assess
how best to meet their customers' electricity needs in ways
consistent with growing concerns about greenhouse gas emissions."
</P>
<P>
Utilities officials took that step Tuesday after repeated
meetings over the past six months with one of Crist's top aides,
Chris Kise, who told them about the governor's concerns regarding
greenhouse gas emissions from coal-burning plants.
</P>
<P>
"It's good to encourage good behavior, and I think they've done
something very positive," Crist said.
</P>
<P>
After Crist was sworn in as governor in January, he dispatched
Kise, whose title is "counsellor to the governor," to meet with
FPL executives and the executive director of the consortium
involved in the Taylor Energy Center. They talked about global
warming.
</P>
<P>
"They got a sense of where the governor's leadership is on the
environmental considerations," said Kise, a Miami native who
served as solicitor general when Crist was attorney general.
</P>
<P>
The four utilities involved in the Taylor County plant were "very
receptive to the governor's message about climate change," Kise
said.
</P>
<P>
Taylor project spokesman Mark McCain said Kise didn't tell anyone
what to do, but "we shared information about the project and how
it compares with other options." As a result, he said, utilities
officials realized that "climate change is becoming a major issue
in Florida."
</P>
<P>
That point was driven home by last month's decision by the PSC to
reject FPL's Glades Power Park plan. FPL officials had announced
last September that they would build the plant on about 5,000
acres of Glades County farmland owned by Tampa-based Lykes
Brothers. The location would have put the plant within 70 miles
of Everglades National Park and 40 miles north of Big Cypress
National Preserve.
</P>
<P>
Crist openly questioned the plant's location, the National Park
Service raised concerns about air pollution and environmental
groups argued it would increase greenhouse gases at a time when
the nation is trying to combat global warming.
</P>
<P>
On June 5, PSC commissioners rejected the plant by a 4-0 vote,
saying they worried that electric rates could grow much higher
for the coal plant if Congress begins taxing carbon emissions as
a way to reverse climate change.
</P>
<P>
The vote marked the first time global warming had ever played a
role in a PSC decision, and the first time in 15 years the agency
rejected a new power plant.
</P>
<P>
So this week the four utilities  Tallahassee, the Jacksonville
Electric Authority, the Florida Municipal Power Agency and the
Disney-based Reedy Creek Improvement District  agreed to stop
seeking state permits to build the Taylor Energy Center plant
near Perry.
</P>
<P>
"It's more important that we work with state leaders to craft an
energy plan for Florida," Taylor Energy Center project manager
Mike Lawson said in a news release, noting that he looked forward
to attending the governor's summit.
</P>
<P>
The announcement marked a startling turnabout for Taylor County
residents who opposed the plant. "I'm tickled!" said resident Joy
Towles Ezell, who frequently referred to the plant as the "Taylor
Emphysema Center."
</P>
<P>
The Taylor plant "was a 19th century solution to a 21st century
problem," said Ross Burnaman, a Tallahassee lawyer who had sued
to try to stop the plant.
</P>
<P>
"We've got to have power. We know that," Crist said at his news
conference. "But to continue to rely on foreign oil and coal, I
don't think is in the best interests of our state."
</P>
<P>
Crist's anti-coal crusade isn't over. Last month his Department
of Environmental Protection withdrew support for a permit for the
Seminole Electric Co. to add onto a coal-burning plant in Putnam
County.
</P>
<P>
Because the Putnam plant is an addition to an existing plant,
environmental groups had not lined up against it as they did the
Everglades and Taylor County plants. It seemed to face smooth
sailing.
</P>
<P>
But now the DEP has raised a major hurdle, filing a legal motion
that says the state needs to consider limiting the plant's
greenhouse gases.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile the agenda for next week's climate summit calls for
discussions of clean energy sources .
</P>
<P>
The conference's cost, estimated at more than $370,000, is being
covered by donations from environmental groups and business
interests, according to Tom Linley of Volunteer Florida, the
agency coordinating the funding. For instance, Walt Disney is
giving $10,000; General Electric, $20,000; and Environmental
Defense, $95,000. To environmental activists, it adds up to one
thing: Crist is serious about global warming.
</P>
<P>
"The governor has made a fundamental decision that Florida needs
to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions, and he's taking a stand
that he's not going to allow any new emission sources," Glickman
said. "It's the definition of leadership on this issue."
