BUMP IN FUEL COSTS, SLUMP IN HOUSING CAN ' T HALT MARKET CLIMB
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Home foreclosures soaring? Oil nearing $74 a barrel? Gasoline
prices topping $3 a gallon? So what.
</P>
<P>
Wall Street again shrugged off some pesky consumer costs and
finished a strong week as the Dow Jones industrial average soared
more than 300 points in two days and moved within striking
distance of 14,000. The blue chip index closed Friday at a record
13,907.25.
</P>
<P>
The late-week rally, which began Thursday with the biggest one-
day gain in nearly four years, is the latest sign that a strong
global economy and improving US conditions are trumping concerns
about the slumping housing market and rising energy costs.
</P>
<P>
The Dow has gained more than 600 points since early June, and
more than 1,400, or 12 percent, for the year. The broader
Standard &amp;amp; Poor's 500 Index is up 9.5 percent for the
year.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said a combination of a solid global expansion, moderate
US inflation, and low interest rates means stocks are poised to
move higher. However, bad news on housing and energy could still
spark deep sell-offs, and analysts expect the market to swing up
and down through the rest of the year.
</P>
<P>
"There are still some rough days ahead," said Jim Swanson, chief
investment strategist at MFS Investment Management in Boston.
</P>
<P>
But if anything, this bull market has shown it can weather rough
days and come back roaring. It rebounded from a 416-point plunge
in February and, more recently, a nearly 200-point drop June 7.
</P>
<P>
"For all the gyrations, the economy is on a moderate growth
track," said Stuart Hoffman, chief economist at PNC Financial in
Pittsburgh. "I expect the market is heading higher, maybe not
another 10 percent, but continuing its two steps forward, one
step back" pattern.
</P>
<P>
In addition to strong global growth, the bull market has been
sustained by a resilient US economy. After expanding at an anemic
0.7 percent annual rate in the first quarter, the US economy is
expected to grow in the second quarter at an annual rate well
above 3 percent, according to economists.
</P>
<P>
Employers have been adding an average of 145,000 jobs a month
this year, and the jobless rate has slipped to 4.5 percent. Wages
are rising, too, supporting consumer spending, which accounts for
more than two-thirds of economic activity.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, inflation remains under control, and interest rates,
while higher than a few years ago, remain relatively low.
</P>
<P>
"The market is absorbing the fact that the economy is
rebounding," said Nariman Behravesh, chief economist at Global
Insight, a Waltham forecasting firm.
</P>
<P>
This week's rally was sparked Thursday when some of the nation's
biggest retailers, including Wal-Mart Stores Inc., reported
better-than-expected sales in June. Investors viewed those
results as a sign consumer spending is solid, despite gasoline
prices of about $3 a gallon and falling home values.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, investors were cheered by a Commerce Department report
that businesses are rebuilding inventories, which typically
boosts manufacturing. The University of Michigan also reported
that consumer sentiment improved significantly in early July,
viewed as another support for consumer spending.
</P>
<P>
"The market has come to the realization that the consumer is
holding up," said Richard Hoyt, market strategist at KDV Wealth
Management in Minneapolis. "There are good economic fundamentals,
the foremost of which is job growth."
</P>
<P>
Strong global growth, meanwhile, is fueling corporate profits and
subsequently stock prices since the biggest US companies have
extensive international operations. For example, EMC Corp. of
Hopkinton and Genzyme Corp. of Cambridge each generate more than
40 percent of their revenues internationally.
</P>
<P>
China's economy is growing at double-digit rates, while Europe
and Japan's economies have picked up steam in recent years.
Japan's economy, for example, is projected to grow 2.8 percent
this year, compared to 2.2 percent in 2006, according to Global
Insight. This growth has boosted demand for US products. Exports
hit a record $132 billion in May, the Commerce Department
reported.
</P>
<P>
As a result, analysts are expecting US corporations this month to
report another quarter of solid profits.
</P>
<P>
Profits of corporations included in Standard &amp;amp; Poor's 500
Index grew nearly 8 percent in the first quarter, according to
Thomson-First Call, a financial research firm. That followed 14
consecutive quarters of double-digit profit growth.
</P>
<P>
These consistently strong profits have left corporations awash
with cash, which in turn is also helping to boost stock prices.
Many corporations have used the money to buy back stock, reducing
the number of shares outstanding and increasing values. Some have
used the money to acquire other firms, which also can drive up
stock prices.
</P>
<P>
Also helping to fuel mergers and acquisitions are global interest
rates, which, while rising, remain at attractive levels.
</P>
<P>
"All that money has to find a home," said Jim Weiss, president of
Weiss Capital Management of Concord.
</P>
<P>
And one place is the stock market, Weiss said. Like other
analysts, Weiss said he expects the market to swing up and down
as it grapples with the housing downturn but ultimately to move
higher.
</P>
<P>
"As long as interest rates don't spike on a long-term basis," he
said, "the market has some more to go."
