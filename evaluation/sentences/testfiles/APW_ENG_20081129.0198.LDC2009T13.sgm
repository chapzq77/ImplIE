Hamas claims mortar attack on army base

GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip 2008-11-29 08:38:50 UTC

<P>
The Islamic militant Hamas on Saturday claimed responsibility for
a mortar attack on an Israeli army base that injured eight
Israeli soldiers.
</P>
<P>
The mortar shells were fired from Hamas-ruled Gaza late Friday at
an army base along Israel's border with territory. The Israeli
military said eight soldiers were hurt, including two who were in
serious condition.
</P>
<P>
The attack came after more than three weeks of renewed cross-
border fighting. Israel and Hamas had agreed to a cease-fire in
June, but the truce started to unravel in early November,
following an Israeli cross-border raid. Israel has kept Gaza's
borders closed since Nov. 5 to try to pressure militants to halt
the attacks.
</P>
<P>
Immediately after the attack, another militant group, the Popular
Resistance Committees, claimed responsibility. Some militants
belong to both groups, and it is common for rival militant groups
to claim responsibility for the same attack.
</P>
<P>
It was not immediately possible to confirm either claim.
