Russia silent on spy murder extradition: Britain
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Russia has yet to respond formally to Britain's request five
weeks ago to extradite the chief suspect in the London murder of
ex-Russian agent Alexander Litvinenko, a British diplomat said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"In the last five weeks we have not received an official answer
to the request" to extradite Andrei Lugovoi, news agency Interfax
quoted British Ambassador to Russia Anthony Brenton as saying in
an interview.
</P>
<P>
British prosecutors have charged Lugovoi, a former KGB agent
turned businessman, with murdering Litvinenko last November using
the radioactive isotope polonium-210.
</P>
<P>
The case has severely strained relations between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Russia has said its constitution forbids extraditing Russian
citizens to face justice abroad, while Britain maintains that
previous agreements with Russia allow it.
</P>
<P>
Litvinenko was a former Russian intelligence agent and a fierce
Kremlin critic, who received political asylum and citizenship in
Britain.
