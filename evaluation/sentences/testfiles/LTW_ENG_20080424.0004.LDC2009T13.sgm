Ending the Guessing Game in Concussion Recovery
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As athletes at Hammond High School in Columbia, Md., headed off
to games and practices after school Friday, junior varsity
lacrosse player Jake Rotter strolled to an empty computer lab to
once again square off against his stiffest adversary: himself.
</P>
<P>
Rotter sustained a concussion during the junior varsity football
season, experienced lingering headaches that prompted him to
leave the wrestling team and then endured another concussion
playing lacrosse this spring.
</P>
<P>
In previous years, the school's athletic trainer and Rotter's
doctor would have monitored his symptoms -- if there were obvious
signs, which is not always the case -- and made a determination
about when he could return to action.
</P>
<P>
Now Howard County schools can join other school districts that
can make quantifiable decisions with the ImPACT (Immediate Post-
Concussion Assessment and Cognitive Testing) program, a tool to
help track recovery from concussions. The program, developed by
Mark Lovell at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, is
used by professional sports teams, colleges and hundreds of high
schools in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Howard began using it this school year, and it is free to
students, with parental permission.
</P>
<P>
Here's how it works: Before the season, an athlete takes the
computerized ImPACT test, which, in part, measures his memory and
reaction time after being shown a series of words, designs,
patterns and symbols. It takes about 25 minutes. There is no
particular score for which to strive; each athlete's results
provide a baseline of information.
</P>
<P>
"It definitely tests you," Rotter said.
</P>
<P>
If the athlete experiences a head injury, he retakes the test to
see how his results compare with his baseline reading. Is there a
lapse in memory? Reaction time? Some other decline in
performance?
</P>
<P>
If his retest results fall markedly short of his baseline
numbers, he probably will be deemed not ready to play. The
athlete will continue to sit out until his ImPACT scores are
close to his pre-concussion results.
</P>
<P>
The ImPACT test findings remove some of the guesswork about
whether an athlete is fit to resume play, and the graphic
representation of results makes it easy to explain to athletes
and their parents why the athlete might or might not be fully
recovered from a head injury.
</P>
<P>
"There's a real gap in the knowledge of this injury," said Gerry
Gioia, director of neuropsychology and director of the Safe
Concussion Outcome, Recovery and Education (SCORE) Program at
Children's National Medical Center in Washington. "What happens
is families and kids are getting lots of different messages about
whether they can go back to play or not, and many times it's not
based on any objective or systematic data."
</P>
<P>
To learn more about the ImPACT program, and to take the test
ourselves, we caught up with Rotter, 16, and Hammond athletic
trainer Tim Happel on Friday when Rotter was retaking the test
for the second time since sustaining a concussion late last
month.
</P>
<P>
Rotter first got concussed in first grade in a bike accident. He
lost his short-term memory for a few days. A person who sustains
a concussion can be more vulnerable to concussion than those who
have not sustained such an injury.
</P>
<P>
"Oh, another butterfly gave you a concussion?" a buddy said to
Rotter recently, jokingly suggesting that the middle linebacker-
offensive lineman and lacrosse defender, known for his physical
playing style, is soft.
</P>
<P>
When Rotter, who is enrolled in honors courses, is concussed, he
suffers from headaches and a lack of concentration. "It feels
like you have a haze over you, a fog, kind of," he said, adding
that his grade-point average dipped from about a 3.57 to a 2.71
in the fall when he had trouble focusing after his football
concussion.
</P>
<P>
"He's in all really, really intense classes, so concussions have
much more effect there than on the field," said his mother,
Julie.
</P>
<P>
Rotter could tell when he took the first retest April 2 that he
was not particularly sharp. He noticed further improvement Friday
afternoon, taking it for a second time since his lacrosse
concussion. But before clearing him to play, Happel wanted to
consult with Gioia, who helped develop the concussion treatment
program for Howard schools. (Gioia's children play sports at
Mount Hebron High in Ellicott City, Md.)
</P>
<P>
"It seemed like I could remember the shapes a lot easier," Rotter
said after his second retest. "I was a lot faster, it felt like.
It was a pretty obvious difference."
</P>
<P>
Mike Williams, coordinator of athletics for Howard schools, said
that the county's dozen high schools have tested an average of
about 200 athletes each. With the program becoming more
established, he expects that number to grow to 400 or more next
school year.
</P>
<P>
"They used to say after two days you could return" from a
concussion, Williams said. "Then it went to a week. Now research
shows that with high school students, their brains are still
developing, and a sustained concussion in a high school student
can impact their learning and development for a lifetime. When we
saw that, that's what really sold us. It's not a perfect science,
but it's the best thing out there."
</P>
<P>
The cost of the program is $9,000 for the software, about $750
for each of Howard's 12 high schools. But for school systems
without certified athletic trainers, administering and
interpreting the tests could be a problem. Howard has a trainer.
</P>
<P>
For athletes itching to get back on the field, the ImPACT test
can be friend or foe: friend if it raises no red flags, which
might result in getting back sooner, or foe if the athlete feels
fine -- or is downplaying symptoms, which is common -- but falls
short of baseline benchmarks when retaking the test.
</P>
<P>
Oh, and don't try to lowball your initial ImPACT test. Not only
could it be hazardous to your health, it could be embarrassing.
Gioia said the test has indicators that expose sandbaggers.
</P>
<P>
"I feel like (the ImPACT test) is holding me back a little bit,"
Rotter said, "but I'm also glad it exists. Because if it didn't
exist, I'd be back on the field and getting another concussion
and be in a worse state."
