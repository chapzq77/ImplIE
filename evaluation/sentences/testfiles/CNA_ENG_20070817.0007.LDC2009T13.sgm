Taipei,  Aug. 17 (CNA) 08/17/07  11:44:42 (By Deborah Kuo)

Taiwan is bracing for the largest storm to hit so far this year,
as Typhoon Sepat, for which the Central Weather Bureau (CWB)
issued a land warning at 8: 30 p.m. Thursday, continues to
approach Taiwan Friday.
</P>
<P>
CWB meteorologists forecast that Sepat will begin to pound Taiwan
with strong winds and torrential rain from Friday afternoon and
that its onslaught is expected to cover the entire island with a
radius of 250 km.
</P>
<P>
The typhoon was centered 390 km southeast of Taitung in eastern
Taiwan as of 9 a.m., moving northwesterly at 18-21 kph toward the
island and packing maximum sustained winds of 184 kph.
</P>
<P>
CWB chief meteorologist Lu Kuo-chen said strong winds and heavy
rains are expected to begin to hit Taiwan later Friday, with the
typhoon's influence on the island expected to peak between Friday
night and Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
Flash floods are expected to pound eastern and southern Taiwan
again throughout Saturday and Sunday in the wake of two tropical
storms -- Pabuk and Wutip -- which swept across Taiwan last week
and caused landslides and flash floods in those areas, Lu said.
