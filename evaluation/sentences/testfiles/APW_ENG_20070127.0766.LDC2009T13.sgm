Senegalese riot police fired tear gas at protesters calling for
early parliamentary elections, beating back the crowd with rifle
butts and detaining the head of the country's main opposition
party Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Moustapha Niasse, who in addition to leading the opposition has
twice served as Senegal's prime minister and is a former U.N.
special envoy, was dragged by the scruff of his neck through the
streets, before being taken into custody by police, witnesses and
opposition party officials said. The 67-year-old was released
several hours later, along with other detained members of the
opposition.

One opposition party leader, Mata Sy Diallo, who heads the
women's division of the Alliance for the Forces of Progress,
fainted in the onslaught of tear gas and was taken away by
ambulance, witnesses said.

Senegal, long touted as an example of democracy in a sea of
corrupt West African states, has met with criticism recently
after its government unexpectedly canceled parliamentary
elections last year, rescheduling them for February.
</P>
<P>
Sparking the protest was the interior ministry's decision two
weeks ago to reschedule the parliamentary elections a second time
-- now pushing them back to June.
</P>
<P>
"Today, Senegal is finishing dead last in the democracy class.
Security forces brutalized our people when all we're trying to do
is march. It's a right that's enshrined in our constitution,"
said Mamadou Ly, the permanent secretary of the Alliance for the
Forces of Progress.
</P>
<P>
The director of national security for the Senegalese police said
the demonstrator's had brought the violence onto themselves. "The
protesters did not have a permit to march. They chose to do so
anyway, violating the law. The police was simply doing its
homework," said Leopold Diouf, who oversees the country's
security forces.
</P>
<P>
Although the country's constitution allows marches, the
protesters were not granted a permit by Dakar authorities, a
technicality which opposition leaders say is being used to
undermine the basic tenet of the constitution. City officials
declined to give the permit saying they could not ensure the
safety of the marchers.
</P>
<P>
Opposition party leaders say the city has never granted a
marching permit to members of the opposition .

<P>
Senegal's President Abdoulaye Wade is up for re-election in
February.
</P>
<P>
Niasse was the country's foreign minister between 1978 and 1983,
when he briefly became prime minister. He was appointed prime
minister a second time under Wade in 2000, before resigning 11
months later. In 2002, he was appointed a U.N. special envoy to
the Democratic Republic of Congo by former U.N. Secretary General
Kofi Annan.
