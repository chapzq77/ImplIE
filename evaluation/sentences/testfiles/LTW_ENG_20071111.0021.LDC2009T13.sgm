CONSUMER CONFIDENTIAL: Why Car Shoppers Buy Foreign
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

"It's definitely not a cool-looking car," he decided as he
examined a 2008 model selling for $27,848 at a Toyota dealership
. "But people are talking about oil going to $100 a barrel.
That's just nuts."
</P>
<P>
I was curious to see what   effect skyrocketing oil and gasoline
prices were having on car buyers. I also wanted to see what the
view from the trenches was after General Motors Corp., the
world's largest automaker, reported a $39-billion quarterly loss.
</P>
<P>
Hartunian, who is 35 and single, wasn't sure about the Prius'
styling. It's not exactly a babe magnet. But  Hartunian was
pretty certain a Prius was the way to go, given its estimated 48
miles per gallon  in city driving.
</P>
<P>
And he was sure of this much: He didn't  want an American car.
</P>
<P>
"We don't make good cars," Hartunian said with a shrug.
</P>
<P>
There it is. True or not, that's a belief shared by many U.S.
drivers, and it's hammering domestic carmakers.
</P>
<P>
Asian  brands, led by Toyota, Nissan and Honda,  account for
slightly more than 41 percent of the U.S. market, and that
percentage is rising. GM, Ford and Chrysler account for slightly
more than  51 percent of the domestic market, and that percentage
is falling.
</P>
<P>
Caroline Wilmoth, 18, drives a 2007 Toyota Scion tC, which sells
for less than  $20,000 and gets about 23 miles per gallon in the
city. She told me that when she went shopping for her first  new
car  she didn't even consider a U.S. brand. "I heard that Toyota,
Nissan and Honda were the best cars you could buy," Wilmoth
explained.
</P>
<P>
I'd like to say I found plenty of people at domestic dealerships
who could refute that sentiment. But that would be a lie.
</P>
<P>
Maybe it was the time of day (morning). Maybe it was the day of
the week (Thursday). I don't know. All I know is that when I
stopped by various American-vehicle showrooms in the Pasadena,
Calif., area, I couldn't find a single customer on hand to chat
with. Not one.
</P>
<P>
Nick Nielsen, the sales manager at a Buick and Pontiac
dealership, made no secret of his displeasure as we chatted in
his all-too-quiet workplace.
</P>
<P>
"The car market is terrible, if you want to know the truth," he
said. "Across the board."
</P>
<P>
At his dealership, Nielsen observed, sales  were down about 40
percent from a year ago. And they were down last year as well.
</P>
<P>
It's not that U.S. cars can't hold their own against their
Japanese rivals, Nielsen insisted. American cars are every bit as
good as Toyotas and Nissans, he said. But there's a perception in
the marketplace that a Buick, say, is somehow inferior.
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to get rid of that perception," Nielsen said.
</P>
<P>
His face hardened. "I personally won't buy a non-American car,"
Nielsen said. "I'm an American. You have to support your
country."
</P>
<P>
That's a nifty bumper sticker, but it's not exactly a selling
point.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. car market is nothing if not competitive, and consumers
will look elsewhere if a particular automaker doesn't strike
their fancy. You have to give people what they want.
</P>
<P>
That's especially true as fuel  prices flirt with record highs.
The price of a barrel of crude topped $98 on Wednesday before
easing  a tad. Oil was trading around $96 a barrel on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Many analysts say oil soon will hit $100 for the first time,
which will ripple throughout the economy and  right into the gas
pump.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, the Automobile Club of Southern California reported
that gas prices in the region were within 20 cents of their all-
time highs after climbing about 2 cents a day last week in most
areas.
</P>
<P>
A gallon of self-serve regular was averaging $3.297 in the Los
Angeles-Long Beach area. That's 13.7 cents higher than a week
before, 31 cents above the month-earlier level and nearly $1 more
than a year ago.
</P>
<P>
"Crude oil prices have been breaking records since September, and
that increase has hit gas pump prices in a big way this week in
Southern California and throughout the U.S.," said Jeffrey
Spring, an auto club spokesman.
</P>
<P>
With that in mind, I stopped by a Hummer dealership to get a
sense of how things looked from the perspective of one of the
biggest, fattest, gas-guzzlingest vehicles on the road.
</P>
<P>
I had the lot to myself as I wandered among the shiny, tanklike
behemoths. A black Hummer H2 was selling for $65,955. As if it
were silly to even ask, the sticker said mileage info was "not
applicable to this vehicle."
</P>
<P>
In fact, most reviews place the GM-made H2's fuel efficiency at
around 10 miles per gallon in the city.
</P>
<P>
I approached a salesman and asked how business had  been. When he
learned I was from the newspaper, he  clammed up and said he
couldn't answer any questions.
</P>
<P>
I  asked  about who buys Hummers these days.
</P>
<P>
The salesman called his boss over. He, too, declined to answer
any questions and  made it clear that my presence at the
dealership wasn't welcome.
</P>
<P>
So I went back to the Toyota showroom, where rock music was
playing and a smattering of customers were browsing among the
vehicles.
</P>
<P>
William Stackhouse, 85, was having some maintenance done on his
2007 Prius. I asked how he felt about buying American.
</P>
<P>
"That's a nice idea," Stackhouse replied. "I just wish Detroit
made cars as good as the Japanese cars."
</P>
<P>
So does Detroit.
