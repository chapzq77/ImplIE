on long-haul plane tickets by as much as a third because of
tumbling oil prices which slash the cost of jet fuel.

"British Airways will drop its fuel surcharge by as much as a
third on longhaul services from Thursday, December 18," the
arline said in a brief statement.

"The move reflects the reduction in the price of oil and the
airlineâ€™s fuel hedging policy for 2009/10," it added.

Hedging is a practice of insuring against future price volatility
by buying future deliveries at pre-determined prices.
