32 Killed in Virginia Tech Shootings, At Least 24 Injured
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thirty-two people reportedly were killed and more than two dozen
injured during a shooting rampage Monday morning at Virginia Tech
University in Blacksburg, Va., making it the deadliest mass
shooting in U.S. history, law enforcement sources said.
</P>
<P>
The unidentified shooter was among the dead, according to
officials. The dead were at West Ambler Johnston, a dormitory,
and Norris Hall, which houses the College of Engineering.
Authorities said the first shooting was reported shortly after 7
a.m. at the dorm and the second about two hours later at Norris
Hall. Law enforcement sources said a single shooter was
responsible for both incidents.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, university officials confirmed a lower number
of fatalities.
</P>
<P>
Virginia Tech Police Chief Wendell Flinchum, speaking at a news
conference Monday, said he did not know whether the shooter was a
student. Some of those killed were students in a classroom at
Norris Hall, he said.
</P>
<P>
``Monday the university was struck with a tragedy that we
consider of monumental proportions,'' Virginia Tech president
Charles Steger said at the news conference. ``The university is
shocked and indeed horrified that this would befall us.''
</P>
<P>
Monday's shootings occurred on opposite sides of the 2,600-acre
campus, leaving students and workers under siege. The university,
founded in 1872, has more than 25,000 fulltime students.
</P>
<P>
The co-ed West Ambler Johnston dorm is one of the largest
residence halls on campus, housing 895 residents.
</P>
<P>
Area hospitals treating the wounded have reported at least 10
people are in critical condition and several are in surgery. At
least four area hospitals are treating the wounded.
</P>
<P>
On the first day of the school year last August, Virginia Tech
was shut down because of concerns that a gunman was on campus.
The man, an escaped inmate accused of killing a sheriff's deputy
and a security guard, was later captured on the school grounds.
</P>
<P>
The campus, about four hours southwest of Washington, was shut
down for the day Monday. Families trying to find students are
advised to meet them at the Inn at Virginia Tech.
</P>
<P>
Counseling has been set up in the Merriman Center for employees
and students. A convocation has been scheduled for noon Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The worst mass slaying in U.S. history occurred Oct. 16, 1991, at
Luby's Cafeteria in Killeen, Texas. George Hennard rammed his
truck into the cafeteria and opened fire on the lunchtime crowd,
killing 22 people before turning his gun on himself and taking
his own life.
</P>
<P>
At the White House, Dana Perino, deputy press secretary, said:
``The president was made aware of the Virginia Tech shootings. He
was horrified. And his immediate reaction was one of deep concern
for the families of the victims, the victims themselves, the
students, the professors and all the people of Virginia who have
dealt with this shocking incident. And his thoughts and prayers
are with them.''
</P>

Carol Chappell, spokeswoman for Lewis-Gale Medical Center in
Salem, Va., and Montgomery Regional in Blacksburg, said five of
the injured were being treated at Lewis-Gale, which is a 521-bed
facility. She said some of the injured at Lewis-Gale were
referred from Montgomery Medical. Of the five patients admitted,
four were students and one was a faculty member, she said. Two of
the most critical were in surgery at 3 p.m.
</P>
<P>
She said 18 students are being treated at Montgomery Regional.
Four of the most critical were in surgery in the middle of the
afternoon. All were being treated for gunshot wounds and other
unspecified injuries.
</P>
<P>
``It's so overwhelming,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
Eric Earnhart, spokesman for the Carilion New River Hospital near
Radford and the Carilion Roanoke Memorial Hospital said four
people were being treated at New River, which is about 20 minutes
from Blacksburg. Three are in stable condition and one is in
critical condition, he said.
</P>
<P>
Roanoke Memorial, 45 minutes from Blacksburg and part of
Carilion's 10-hospital system in western Virginia, is treating
three of the injured, all in critical condition, Earnhart said.
</P>
<P>
Earnhart confirmed that the four hospitals treating patients
involved in the shooting were Memorial Regional, New River,
Roanoke Memorial, a Level 1 Trauma Center, and Lewis-Gale.
</P>
<P>
Students and staff were notified by e-mail and automated
voicemails that a gunman was on the loose and that everyone
should stay in their buildings and ``away from windows.''
</P>
<P>
All across campus, people were trying to figure out what was
happening, with cell phones sometimes working and sometimes not,
the university Web site sometimes working and sometimes not, and
the sound of sirens everywhere. Many watched from inside dorm
rooms or offices, trading rumors and bad news.
</P>
<P>
Wayne Neu, a professor of ocean engineering, was in his office
across from Norris Hall when he heard shots, including what
sounded like a police shotgun. ``I saw one faculty member who was
shot in the arm apparently being led away,'' he said. ``I've been
here 25 years I've never seen something like this happen.''
</P>
<P>
Matteo del Ninno, a junior from Alexandria, Va., had overslept
and was rushing to his 10:10 a.m. class in Norris 200, when his
girlfriend text-messaged him to see if he was OK. He hadn't heard
anything about shootings but noticed the ambulances around; after
her warning he went back to his house next to campus and checked
all his messages. He's worried about his friends, engineering
students who always meet before class in the hall.
</P>
<P>
Staff and students contacted by telephone said the morning's
events were unnerving.
</P>
<P>
One woman who answered the phone in the school's Entomology
Department said that about 9:45, they were notified that everyone
was to remain in their offices and not venture out but were not
given any other details. ``There's cop cars everywhere,'' said
the woman.
