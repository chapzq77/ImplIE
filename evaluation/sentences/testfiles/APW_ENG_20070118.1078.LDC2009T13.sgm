Leading Moroccan journalist and regime critic resigns under
government pressure

<P>
A leading Moroccan journalist and critic of Morocco's King
Mohamed VI announced Thursday he is resigning under mounting
pressure from the government.
</P>
<P>
Aboubakr Jamai, gadfly editor of the political weekly Le Journal
Hebdomadaire, told The Associated Press he is stepping down
immediately to save the publication.
</P>
<P>
Jamai has been hit with numerous government-backed libel suits
and fines, and said disentangling his debts from the magazine's
finances was essential to keeping it afloat.
</P>
<P>
The government has said the prosecution of Jamai is not intended
to sink the Le Journal Hebdomadaire.
</P>
<P>
The weekly's co-founder Ali Amar will take over Jamai's post.
</P>
<P>
Jamai's departure was prompted by an order from the Justice
Ministry last month that Jamai and former Le Journal Hebdomadaire
journalist Fahd Iraqi pay damages of 3 million dirhams
(US$349,000; euro270,000) in one of the many suits against Jamai
-- the largest such fine in Moroccan history.
</P>
<P>
Jamai said he plans to move abroad with his family, but he hasn't
decided where he will go or what he will do.
</P>
<P>
Jamai said he would not continue to write for Le Journal
Hebdomadaire from abroad, saying that doing so would help the
government "succeed in tricking people that there's true freedom
of press in this country."
</P>
<P>
The libel suits, and the conviction of two journalists this week
over jokes their weekly published relating to Islam, have led to
concerns that the North African kingdom may be backsliding on
moves in recent years to relax long-standing restrictions on the
media.
