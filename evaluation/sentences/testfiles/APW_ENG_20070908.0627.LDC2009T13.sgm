A Serbian nationalist priest whose hunger strike at the border
with Montenegro has triggered a diplomatic row between the two
former allies has been hospitalized, Serbia's state television
reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Bishop Filaret, known for his support of Serbian ultra-
nationalists, and who was once photographed holding a machine
gun, started refusing food 10 days ago at a border crossing to
protest a ban on his entry into Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
He was taken to a hospital overnight Friday with his health
deteriorating, RTS TV said, adding that his life was not in
danger.
</P>
<P>
Montenegrin authorities said the priest was banned because he was
listed by the U.N. war crimes court for the former Yugoslavia as
an alleged helper of fugitives sought by the court -- including
former Bosnian Serb military commander Ratko Mladic and wartime
leader Radovan Karadzic -- and is subject to an EU travel ban.
</P>
<P>
Montenegro, however, on Saturday agreed to let Filaret into the
country, but only "to perform religious duties under a
supervision of the state authorities," Montenegro's Foreign
Minister Milan Rocen said.
</P>
<P>
Tensions between Belgrade and Podgorica escalated this week when
an adviser to the Serbian prime minister called Montenegro "a
quasi-state," prompting Podgorica to seek an apology and lodge a
formal protest with Serbia's government.
</P>
<P>
Serbia and Montenegro share the same historic and cultural
background, and formed a joint state until June 2006, when
Montenegro, which has 600,000 people compared with Serbia's 8
million, split from the union.
