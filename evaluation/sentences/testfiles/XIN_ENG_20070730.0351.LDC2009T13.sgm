<P>
At least eight senior military officers have been arrested for
having links to a cocaine cartel, Colombia's Defense Minister
Juan Manuel Santos told a press conference on Monday.
</P>
<P>
They took bribes from the Norte del Valle Cartel, led by
fugitives Wilber Varela and Don Diego, who are also wanted by
courts in the United States, said the minister, adding that there
would be more arrests in the coming days.
</P>
<P>
"With these infiltrations they had prevented us from following up
the investigations." said Santos.
</P>
<P>
Colombian military officers are long accused of receiving money
from paramilitaries and drug traffickers.

<P>
"Strengthening intelligence is a priority. The efforts we have
been making are yielding results," Santos said.
