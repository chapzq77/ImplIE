A six-year-old girl has been hospitalized after a horrifying
accident at a swimming pool, when she sat on an open drain and a
powerful suction pump tore out part of her intestinal tract.
</P>
<P>
Abigail Taylor was injured in the wading pool on June 29,
according to her family.

<P>
Her father, Scott Taylor, told WCCO-TV that the suction caused a
2-inch (5-centimeter) tear in Abigail's rectum and pulled out
much of her small intestine. Doctors had to remove the part of
her intestines that remained, according to the family's lawyer,
Bob Bennett.

Abigail remained in intensive care at Children's Hospital on
Thursday and appears to be doing better, Bennett said.

<P>
She was to undergo surgery on Friday, Bennett said. "She'll
receive her nutrition through a port for the rest of her life,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Bennett said that the swimming pool's drain hole was improperly
uncovered. However, the general manager of the club where the
pool is located told the St. Paul Pioneer Press he did not think
anything was wrong with the pool. He referred questions to the
attorney for the club's insurance company, who declined to
comment.
