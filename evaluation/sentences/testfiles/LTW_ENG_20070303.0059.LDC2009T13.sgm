Reporters on Thursday pressed White House spokeswoman Dana Perino
on news reports that the administration is backing away from its
absolute claims that North Korea has a uranium-enrichment
program. This was based on intelligence the White House used to
buttress its case that the regime was part of the ``Axis of
Evil.''
</P>
<P>
``Have you checked into this North Korea story,'' a reporter
asked, ``what -- exactly what our intelligence says about the
North Korean uranium-enrichment program?''
</P>
<P>
``I did try to check into it,'' Perino said. ``I think what I
need to do is refer you to the intelligence community.'' Ah, yes,
a crowd long known for on-the-record briefings on its sources and
process. ``We've said for a long time,'' she said, that ``North
Korea is an opaque regime,'' so it's hard to be sure what they're
doing.
</P>
<P>
``I'm sure the intelligence community continually tried to assess
and reassess and look at the information that they have,'' she
said. ``What we do know is that North Korea tested a nuclear
weapon. ... So, from our standpoint, that's what we know is
happening at the moment. In regards to intel and what they knew
and when they knew it, I think I'd have to refer you back to
them.''

Never mind.
