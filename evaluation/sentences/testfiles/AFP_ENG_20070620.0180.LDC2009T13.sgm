German prosecutor charges suspect in train bomb plot
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The German federal prosecutor's office said Wednesday it had
brought charges against a suspected mastermind behind a failed
plot to bomb two German trains last year.
</P>
<P>
The office said in a statement it had charged Lebanese national
Yusef Mohammed al-Hajj Dib, 22, on June 11 with "an unspecified
number of counts of attempted murder."
</P>
<P>
A court in the western city of Duesseldorf must now decide
whether to put him on trial.
</P>
<P>
Dib and Jihad Hamad, who is also Lebanese, are believed to have
placed suitcases containing homemade bombs on two regional trains
as they passed through Cologne station on July 31.
</P>
<P>
The devices failed to detonate, averting an almost certain
bloodbath in what German officials said was a bid to copy the
train blasts in Madrid and London.
</P>
<P>
The German prosecutor's statement said Dib and Hamad "agreed in
April 2006 in retaliation for the publication of caricatures of
the Prophet Mohammed to mount an attack in the Federal Republic
of Germany with homemade bombs."
</P>
<P>
Dib was arrested in August and is being tried in absentia in
Lebanon, where Hamad and four other alleged accomplices are also
on trial.
</P>
<P>
Hamad said in a German television interview in November that
caricatures of the Prophet Mohammed published in Denmark and
reprinted in German newspapers last year led them to plan the
attack.
