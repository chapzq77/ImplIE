Being a foster parent was one thing, but before taking in
developmentally disabled children, Ken Rowin had to pray for
strength.
</P>
<P>
This was not just feeling sorry for the children or occasionally
caring for them. This was diving into their lives, showing them
love at their most difficult times.
</P>
<P>
A counselor advised Rowin and his wife to visit with another
family who took care of developmentally disabled children, just
to get a taste of what their lives would become. After the visit,
one of Rowin's adopted kids asked him why they had visited with
the children in wheelchairs.
</P>
<P>
"I said, 'God wants us to love these children for him because
nobody else wants to,"' Rowin said. "As soon as those words fell
out of my mouth, I started crying. I just knew deep down in my
heart that's what God wanted us to do, to love these children."
</P>
<P>
The Rowin family has adopted three of those children into their
Mesa home.
</P>
<P>
"If we're looking to him (God) in our strength, our
encouragement, our guidance, then we have the capacity to do
those things," Rowin said. "If I'm looking at it from a human
perspective, and with all my inabilities and inequities, then,
yeah, it is an impossible task."
