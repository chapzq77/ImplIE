FDA approves drug to prevent hepatitis B reinfection in liver
transplant patients

WASHINGTON, April 6 (Xinhua)
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on Friday announced
the approval of HepaGam B for the prevention of hepatitis B
reinfection in certain liver transplant patients.
</P>
<P>
HepaGam B is the first product of its kind (an immune globulin
product) approved for this purpose.
</P>
<P>
Hepatitis B is a serious disease caused by a virus that attacks
the liver and can cause lifelong infection, liver cancer, liver
failure and death. Liver transplant patients who have already
been exposed to the hepatitis B virus (HBV) are at an increased
risk of reinfection because they have weakened immune systems.
</P>
<P>
"This approval provides a new treatment option for the reduction
of hepatitis B recurrence in liver transplant patients with a
prior history of this serious disease," said Jesse Goodman,
director of FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research. "
It is the first immune globulin product -- one of several classes
of proteins derived from human plasma -- approved for this use."
</P>
<P>
HepaGam B works by providing an immediate immune response to the
virus. This immunity protects patients previously exposed to HBV.
Patients must receive injections at the time of their liver
transplant and throughout their lives. This product is
manufactured from human plasma collected at U.S. licensed plasma
centers from healthy donors.
</P>
<P>
FDA based its approval on the company's clinical data in a study
of HBV-infected persons undergoing full liver transplants, which
showed a reduction in the virus recurrence rate from 86 percent
to about 13 percent. Adverse reactions were similar to other
immune globulin products for other indications and included
headache and hypertension.
</P>
<P>
In January 2006, FDA licensed HepaGam B to prevent infection with
HBV for the following other purposes: after acute exposure to
blood or certain body fluids containing HBV; perinatal exposure
of infants to mothers previously exposed to HBV; sexual exposure
to persons previously exposed to HBV; and household exposure to
persons with acute HBV infection.
</P>
<P>
HepaGam B is manufactured by Cangene Corp. of Winnipeg, Canada.
