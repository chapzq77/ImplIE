Europe dominates Olympic slalom racing again

BEIJING, Aug. 15 (Xinhua)
</P>
<P>
Again, the European paddlers dominated the Olympic canoeing
slalom event. They swept four gold medals, won three silver and
two bronze.
</P>
<P>
Three gold in the men's canoe single (C1) and canoe double (C2),
and women's kayak single (K1) went to Slovakia, and one in the
men's K1 to Germany.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Michal Martikan regained the men's C1 title, 12 years
after he won his first Olympic gold in Atlanta and Alexander
Grimm won the men's K1 gold.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, the powerful twin brothers Pavol and Peter
Hochschorner, Olympic champions in Sdyney and Athens, won the
unprecedented third slalom Olympic gold in the men's C2. Elena
Kaliska claimed her second Olympic gold in the women's K1.
</P>
<P>
Australia won silver in the women's K1 and bronze in the men's
C1. Togo took bronze in the men's K1, its first-ever Olympic
medal.
</P>
<P>
But Togo's Benjamin Boukpeti should by no means be counted as an
non-European. He was born and raised in France and has only
visited the western African country once. He chose to represent
Togo because his father was from there and the selection in
France was hard.
</P>
<P>
China's efforts to break the dominance on the home water also
came in vain. Its medal hopes, the men's C2 team of Hu Minghai
and Shu Junrong, and the women's kayaker Li Jingjing, failed to
make finals after incurring heavy penalties for missing gates.
</P>
<P>
Li and the C2 team finished second and third in the heats and had
looked very likely to win the host nation's first-ever slalom
Olympic medal.
</P>
<P>
Europe's domination would be more prominent if the International
Canoe Federation (ICF) allowed all the top paddlers to compete in
the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
ICF President, Ulrich Feldhoff, acknowledged on Thursday that
many top paddlers who were able to make final in the Olympics had
to stay at home because each country was allowed to send at most
one boat in each category.
</P>
<P>
"About 75 percent of the athletes qualified by performances, and
25 percent qualified by enthusiasm," said Feldhoff. "We have to
strive a balance at the Olympics, as it's no European
Championships."
</P>
<P>
Though no break of Europe's dominance was foreseen in the near
future, ICF would happy to see more emerging powers in the white
water sport, ICF Slalom Committee chairperson, Jean-Michel Prono,
told a briefing on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"We'd be happy to see the six medals (men's C2, women's K1)
shared by six different countries. it's a good signal of the
vigor of the sport," said Prono. "The most nations share the
medals, the most we get people involved into the sport. That's
our goal."
