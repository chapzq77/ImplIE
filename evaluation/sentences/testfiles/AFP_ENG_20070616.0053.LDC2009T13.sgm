Taiwan parliament partially passes US arms package
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan has passed part of a controversial arms bill to buy
weaponry from the United States in a bid to boost its defence
capabilities against China, an official said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Among the arms package, the parliament approved late Friday a
total of 6.1 billion Taiwan dollars (184 million US) for the
purchase of P-3C anti-submarine aircraft.
</P>
<P>
However, it only authorised 200 million dollars out of the
proposed 4.5 billion to acquire eight conventional submarines and
cut the 11.3 billion-budget for Patriot anti-missile systems.
</P>
<P>
Another 16-billion-dollar-budget that proposed to buy 66 F-16
fighter jets was frozen.
</P>
<P>
The defence ministry vowed to push for the full approval of arms
package in the next parliamentary session.
</P>
<P>
"We hope the parliament will reconsider the freezed or cut items
on the arms package in order to help enhance Taiwan's defence
capabilities," said Yu Sy-tue, a spokesman for the defence
ministry.
</P>
<P>
The bill had been blocked by the parliament's procedure committee
nearly 70 times before it was finally passed in December.
</P>
<P>
The 10-billion-US-dollar bill, scaled down from the original 16
billion, called for the purchase of six PAC-3 Patriot anti-
missile systems, eight conventional submarines and 12 P-3C
aircraft.
</P>
<P>
Some opposition lawmakers have said Taiwan cannot afford the arms
package while others say the submarines would be delivered too
slowly to enable the island to keep pace with China's military
build-up.
</P>
<P>
The US is the leading arms supplier to Taiwan despite its switch
of diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing in 1979.
</P>
<P>
China still considers the island part of its territory awaiting
reunification despite their split in 1949 at the end of a civil
war.
