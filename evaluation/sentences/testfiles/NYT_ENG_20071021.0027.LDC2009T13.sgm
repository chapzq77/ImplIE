IT ' S RAINING EARNINGS REPORTS
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A big increase, of a sort, is scheduled this week in corporate
earnings. The number of statements issued will grow
significantly, though not necessarily the profits reported in
them.
</P>
<P>
With a sparse economic calendar and a Federal Reserve interest
rate decision lurking a week away, the avalanche of earnings
reports may be foremost on traders' minds. Among the stalwarts of
Corporate America that are to announce results this week are
American Express, Merck, AT&amp;amp;T, DuPont, Boeing and
Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
"We're going to have a continuous stream of earnings that people
will be watching during the week," said Tobias Levkovich, chief
U.S. equity strategist at Citigroup Investment Research.
</P>
<P>
Results announced so far have been better than expected for many
companies, he noted. An important reason, though, is that
expectations have fallen in recent weeks, as often happens before
reports are issued.
</P>
<P>
Chief financial officers and analysts seem to do a quarterly pas
de deux that leads to a reduction in estimates. When numbers are
announced that a few weeks earlier would have seemed ordinary,
traders are impressed.
</P>
<P>
After rising at double-digit annual percentage rates for most of
the last five years, earnings for companies in the Standard
&amp;amp; Poor's 500-stock index are forecast by Thomson
Financial to decline 0.4 percent for the third quarter, dragged
down in part by banks taking steep write-offs for bad loans.
</P>
<P>
Expectations of a Fed rate cut have also diminished, Levkovich
said. Around a month ago, futures contracts suggested that
traders put the chance of a cut in the federal funds rate at 90
percent. Late last week, it was a tossup.
</P>
<P>
"Expectations have come down a lot" for a cut next week, he said,
but traders anticipate a cut later in the year if the Fed does
not move at this meeting. Either way, he said, the consensus
outlook is for "one more and done."
</P>
<P>
Wall Street considers the Fed's response to the summer credit
crisis to have been "broadly successful but not fully
successful," he said, explaining the market's call for one
further rate cut. "It seems we're past the worst but not out of
the woods yet."

DATA WATCH: This week's installment of woeful news from the
housing market is scheduled as a two-parter. On Wednesday, sales
of existing homes for September will be reported; a Bloomberg
News poll of economists forecasts that they will have declined to
an annual rate of 5.25 million units from 5.5 million in August.
A drop is expected the next day in sales of new homes for
September, to an annual rate of 770,000, from 795,000.
