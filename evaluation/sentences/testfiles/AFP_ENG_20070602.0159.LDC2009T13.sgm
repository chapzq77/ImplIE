Three Palestinians were injured and dozens of houses and other
buildings damaged on Saturday when Israeli forces blew up
concrete blocks barring their entry into part of the West Bank
town of Nablus, medics and security sources said.

<P>
An army spokeswoman confirmed the pre-dawn operation at the
entrance to Nablus' Old Town, saying the objective was to "gain
entry to an area where terrorist activities are being carried
out."
</P>
<P>
She claimed that numerous "bomb-making laboratories" had been
discovered there in recent months.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian information minister Mustapha Barghuti visited the
scene, calling the operation a "big crime."
</P>
<P>
Israel considers Nablus to be a militant hotbed and the army
regularly launches arrest raids in the city and its outlying
refugee camps.

<P>
Last year, the army said, Israel foiled 170 bomb plots against
it, 119 of which originated in Nablus.
