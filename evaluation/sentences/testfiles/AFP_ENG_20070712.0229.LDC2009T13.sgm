Underwear's historic role... in Western learning
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Underwear underpins the spread of Western culture, with discarded
underpants ranking alongside the invention of printing in the
spread of literacy, according to a medieval historian.
</P>
<P>
Delegates at the International Medieval Congress at the
University of Leeds, northern England, were told that social
migration from rural to urban areas in the 13th century brought
with it changes in attire.
</P>
<P>
Whereas rough and ready peasants thought little of wearing
nothing under their smocks, the practice became frowned upon in
the burgeoning towns and cities, leading to a run on
undergarments.
</P>
<P>
And when the underwear was worn out, it provided a steady supply
of material used by papermakers to make books.
</P>
<P>
"The development of literacy was certainly helped by the
introduction of paper, which was made from rags," Marco Mostert,
of Utrecht University in the Netherlands and one of the
conference organisers, said this week.
</P>
<P>
"These rags came from discarded clothes, which cost much less
than the very expensive parchment which was previously used for
books.
</P>
<P>
"In the 13th century, so it is thought, as more people moved into
urban centres, the use of underwear increased -- which caused an
increase in the number of rags available for paper-making."
</P>
<P>
The invention of the movable type printing press by Johannes
Gutenberg in the mid-15th century is generally credited with
spreading learning.
</P>
<P>
But Mostert said that although literacy did not become widespread
until the 19th century, it was more common in the Middle Ages
than many believe because of cheap paper made from rags.
