Closed Rulings Questioned in Contract Case
</HEADLINE>

LOS ANGELES
</P>
<P>
As Clive Cussler stumbled through seven days of trial testimony
during his legal showdown with billionaire Philip Anschutz, Judge
John P. Shook expressed skepticism about the 75-year-old
novelist's performance on the witness stand.
</P>
<P>
``Mr. Cussler is smart like a fox,'' Shook said. ``He has got an
iron-trap mind. He knows what is going on here.''
</P>
<P>
The judge made the statement April 20 when he huddled with
lawyers to discuss Cussler's responses before the jury. Like
nearly all of the sidebar conferences held in the high-stakes
trial, the meeting took place behind closed doors.
</P>
<P>
Transcripts of the sessions obtained by the Los Angeles Times
provide rare insights into legal maneuvering, finger-pointing and
posturing in the breach-of-contract case. They reveal how
entertainment lawyer Bertram Fields prevailed in persuading Shook
to ban testimony about Cussler's alleged use of racial and anti-
Semitic epithets. And they show Anschutz's attorneys repeatedly
challenging the way Fields sought to try the case.
</P>
<P>
The documents also raise questions about the court rulings and
oral arguments that took place inside Shook's chambers. Legal
experts say that routinely closing parts of a civil trial to the
public and the media violates the U.S. Constitution and
California's long-standing ``open court'' statute.
</P>
<P>
``This judge needs a little reminder of the First Amendment,''
said Laurie Levenson, a professor at Loyola Law School. ``In no
circumstances should every hearing be held in secret.''
</P>
<P>
Cussler is seeking about $38 million in damages based on claims
that Anschutz and his movie production company reneged on
contractual rights that gave the author ``sole and absolute''
approval over the adaptation of the novel ``Sahara.''
</P>
<P>
Anschutz alleges that Cussler acted unreasonably in exercising
those approvals and committed fraud by flagrantly inflating sales
of his Dirk Pitt novels to extract a $20 million fee for rights
to ``Sahara'' and one other book. Anschutz has lost about $105
million on the adventure film, which starred Matthew McConaughey
and Penelope Cruz.
</P>
<P>
Closing arguments continue Tuesday, and the case is expected to
go to the jury Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Lawyers who practice in Los Angeles Superior Court said it is
highly unusual for judges to close trial proceedings unless there
are compelling reasons such as the need to protect national
security interests or trade secrets.
</P>
<P>
Yet one morning last week Shook, a court reporter and several
lawyers shuffled in and out of the judge's chambers five times in
the span of an hour to discuss rebuttal testimony. The
participants offered conflicting explanations for why they
convened in private at least 59 times during the 58-day trial.
</P>
<P>
Marvin Putnam, Anschutz's lead counsel, said the hearings were
closed at the request of Fields. ``I didn't want this,'' Putnam
said. ``It is beyond extraordinary. I've never seen it.''
</P>
<P>
According to the transcripts, however, Putnam's associates from
the O'Melveny &amp; Myers law firm argued at least twice against
holding hearings in open court. In one instance, an Anschutz
lawyer specifically cited ``the problem'' of trying the case ``in
the press.''

<P>
Fields said it was Shook who wanted to hold sidebar conferences
in private. ``I see nothing sinister about it,'' Fields said.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Fields declined to discuss what took place during
several closed-door meetings. ``This judge gets very upset when
we talk about what goes on in chambers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
Shook replied: ``This judge doesn't get angry about anything.''
In an interview, he said the lawyers asked to retreat to his
office. ``They wanted to have sidebar conferences in chambers so
the jury wouldn't hear them,'' Shook said. ``It doesn't matter to
me one way or another.''

<P>
Before the trial, Fields said in interviews that he was outraged
at plans by Anschutz's lawyers to portray Cussler as a ``crazed
racist and anti-Semite.'' They claimed in court papers that
Cussler made derogatory remarks about blacks and Jews while
exercising his screenplay approvals. The author has denied the
allegations.
</P>
<P>
``They want to get these charges in front of a jury,'' Fields
said, ``so blacks and Jews will hate him.''
</P>
<P>
Shook ruled the alleged remarks were too prejudicial to be
introduced as evidence. The transcripts reveal that Fields was
vigilant about making sure no witness so much as suggested to the
jury that his client uttered a racial or anti-Semitic slur.
</P>
<P>
On March 27, Fields raised concerns in chambers about potentially
damaging testimony by screenwriter David Weisberg. ``If he gets
up there and says (Cussler) told me, `I don't want any more
blacks around. I hate them' -- that shouldn't be in. He can say
anything he wants as long as he doesn't do that,'' Fields said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the trial, Anschutz attorney Alan Rader protested that
Fields behaved inappropriately by telling a witness who referred
to Tom Cruise, ``You know who Tom Cruise's lawyer is?''
</P>
<P>
Rader said that Fields ``announced to that jury, I represent Tom
Cruise so I know best. I know more than this witness or any other
witness. It is outrageous and it is improper, and frankly, it was
arrogant and it poisoned this trial.''
</P>
<P>
After Shook denied a request for a mistrial, Rader shot back, ``I
believe Mr. Fields should be admonished and instructed never to
pull that stunt again.''
</P>
<P>
Shook replied, ``Well, I agree. I don't think we should make
statements that you represent Tom Cruise or any other movie star.
I don't think we are going to hear any more of this from Mr.
Fields or anybody else.''
</P>

<P>
Anschutz's lawyers also accused Fields of coming ``very close''
during his opening statement to violating a court order that
prohibited anyone from telling the jury the reason Cussler had
fired his longtime publicist. In a sworn deposition, Cussler said
he dismissed the employee for financial improprieties.
</P>
<P>
Cussler appeared to violate the order April 19 when he testified
that Shook wouldn't let him explain the firing.
</P>
<P>
``What Mr. Cussler did yesterday, beyond doubt, was
intentional,'' William Charron, an Anschutz lawyer, told Shook in
chambers. ``He had that smile on his face. He is no fool.''
</P>
<P>
Shook concurred that Cussler's remark ``was probably
intentional'' and summoned the novelist into his chambers. He
told Cussler, ``If it happens again, this case is going to be
over.''
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Shook said he wanted to warn Cussler ``in open court on
the record.'' But an Anschutz attorney balked.
</P>
<P>
``Your honor, if we are going to do that, I request that we do it
in chambers,'' Charron said. ``The problem is that this is not
just litigated in the courtroom. It is also litigated in the
press.''
</P>
<P>
Shook replied, ``I see. Good point. I agree.''

The California Supreme Court ruled in 1999 that a Los Angeles
Superior Court judge violated the state's ``open court'' statute
by improperly excluding the public and the media from all
courtroom proceedings held outside the presence of the jury.
</P>
<P>
Judge David M. Schacter sought to protect the litigants, actor
Clint Eastwood and his former lover, Sondra Locke, from
disclosures about their personal lives. Locke claimed that
Eastwood tried to sabotage her directing career after their
romance soured.
</P>
<P>
``The California Supreme Court spoke definitively and unanimously
that you cannot conduct proceedings that should be part of the
ordinary trial process in closed chambers,'' said Douglas Mirell,
a First Amendment lawyer at Loeb &amp; Loeb.
