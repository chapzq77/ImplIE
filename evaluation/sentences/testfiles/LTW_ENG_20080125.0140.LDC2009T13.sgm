Junior Trader Cost French Bank $7 Billion
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The alleged fraud by Jerome Kerviel, 31, staggered Societe
Generale, France's second-largest bank. Its disclosure delivered
a new blow to a European banking industry already reeling from
losses on American subprime mortgage securities -- including a $3
billion writedown announced Thursday by Societe Generale itself.
</P>
<P>
"With everybody already quite scared about financial stocks, this
creates even more of a threat to this sector," said Olivier de la
Ferriere, a financial analyst at Richelieu Finance in Paris.
"There is a real confidence crisis anyway ... this does not
help."
</P>
<P>
And it raised the possibility that the bank, in its haste to
unwind Kerviel's bad bets, may have exacerbated a European stock-
market plunge earlier this week. That decline, in turn, was at
least partially responsible for the Federal Reserve's
extraordinary 3/4-point rate cut on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Societe Generale's chairman, Daniel Bouton, said in a letter to
shareholders that immediately after discovering the scale of the
fraud on Jan. 19, he decided to liquidate Kerviel's futures
positions "in all urgency to avoid even worse consequences, given
(their) size."
</P>
<P>
During a conference call Thursday in Paris, bank officials said
that they completed unwinding all the transactions from Monday
through Wednesday before publicly disclosing the fraud. They said
the bank suffered an "enormous loss" because of unfavorable
market conditions.
</P>
<P>
The actual timing and nature of Societe Generale's sales were
unclear, however, as was its impact on European exchanges. Those
markets plummeted by more than 5 percent on Monday on the heels
of a steep sell off in Asian markets.
</P>
<P>
The Fed announced its rate cut early the following morning. A Fed
official said the central bank was unaware of the Societe
Generale situation when it implemented the rate cut, according to
Reuters and, in any event, the Fed maintained Tuesday that it
took the step in response to "a weakening of the economic
outlook" and to deteriorating financial markets.
</P>
<P>
Societe Generale's loss swamps the previous high-water mark for
activity by a rogue trader -- that set by Nicholas Leeson, who
lost $1.3 billion in Asian futures and other derivatives at
Barings Bank in 1995. That loss bankrupted the 233-year-old
British bank, which subsequently was taken over by the Dutch
financial firm ING.
</P>
<P>
Bank officials and securities analysts said it was unlikely that
the new scandal would have the same impact on Societe General,
which was founded in 1864 and currently has 120,000 employees in
77 countries.
</P>
<P>
It is the owner of Los Angeles-based TCW Group, the parent of
Trust Company of the West, which manages $153 billion for
clients. A TCW spokesman said the trust company was "in no way
directly or indirectly related to any of the losses announced
today by Societe Generale."
</P>
<P>
"This is a very big bank," said Ruth Lea, economic adviser and
director at Arbuthnot Banking Group in London. "It's not as if
it's unenviable. I'd be very surprised if it didn't see its way
through this."
</P>
<P>
French politicians took pains to paint the case as one without
implications beyond the management and regulation of Societe
Generale. French Prime Minister Francois Fillon called the fraud
"a serious matter," but said "it has nothing to do with the
current situation on the global financial markets."
</P>
<P>
Bouton announced Thursday that the bank would show a profit of
$875 million to $1.1 billion for 2007, a sharp decline from
$7.6-billion profit in 2006. He said he had offered to resign
after the disclosure of the trading fraud, but the bank's board
had rejected the overture.
</P>
<P>
Still, the bank said that it would raise $3 billion in capital
through an emergency stock sale that was already underwritten by
a consortium of banks. The capital increase was made necessary by
the trading loss as well as by the writedowns from its exposure
to U.S. credit securities, Bouton said.
</P>
<P>
Although Lea and other analysts speculated that the loss might
make Societe Generale more vulnerable to a takeover, Bouton
turned away questions about that possibility.
</P>
<P>
In trading Thursday on the Paris Bourse, Societe Generale lost
4.4 percent of its value while the CAC 40 index of Paris stocks
gained 6.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
Kerviel -- whom Societe Generale executives did not name but who
was identified in news reports from Europe -- began working at
the bank's back office in 2000, when he was assigned to help
fashion the internal programs that placed transaction limits on
individual traders.
</P>
<P>
In 2005, he was moved to a trading desk, where bank officials
said he was given only limited authority to hedge the bank's
trading positions in European stocks with stock index futures.
This involves making countervailing bets on the future
performance of stocks as an insurance policy against adverse
moves in the bank's stock portfolio.
</P>
<P>
His salary was pegged at 100,000 euros, or about $146,000 a year,
including bonus; the bank said his trades were expected to
generate a modest $20 million in revenue a year.
</P>
<P>
Instead, Kerviel regularly exceeded his trading limits without
detection, starting as early as 2006. Using the knowledge he had
gained in the back office, he concealed his actions by
fabricating balancing trades -- using "extremely sophisticated
and varied techniques," as Bouton said in his letter to
shareholders.
</P>
<P>
At least for a portion of 2007 his trading was profitable; just
before the start of the new year, however, he undertook a huge
bet that European stock markets would rise in January.
</P>
<P>
Instead, they fell sharply, losing nearly 10 percent through last
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The following day, Societe Generale officials confronted Kerviel
with evidence of his unauthorized trading.
</P>
<P>
He immediately confessed and was fired, but spent the weekend
helping superiors create a liquidation strategy.
</P>
<P>
The bank said it had filed legal charges against Kerviel and that
"four or five" officers responsible for financial surveillance
had also lost their jobs. But executives said they believed they
had discovered the full extent of the unauthorized trading.
</P>
<P>
Bank executives said that they could not explain the trader's
motivation, beyond the possibility that he was trying to show
that the bank's financial control procedures could be defeated.
There was no evidence that he personally profited from his
scheme. They had not yet determined whether Kerviel had
accomplices inside or outside the bank.
