A Taiwanese tourist was killed and five others injured in a
traffic accident in Jinan in the northern Chinese province of
Shandong, travel sources said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The dead was identified as Fu Hsueh-chin, a 52-year-old woman,
said a spokesman for Taipei-based Hifly Tourist Service Co. which
organized the eight-day tour of Shandong Province.

The traffic accident happened when the 16-member Taiwan tour
group was on its way from Jinan to Taian, the spokesman said,
adding that details of the accident, including the cause of the
mishap, remain unclear.

According to a name list presented by the travel agency to the
Tourism Bureau, five other members of the tour group, including
one man and four women, were injured in the accident.

Among the injured, one sustained serious injuries which Li Tao,
the information desk chief with the Jinan city government's
Taiwan Affairs Office, said are not life-threatening. But Li said
he has yet to receive full information about details of the
victim's injuries. The other four victims reportedly only
sustained minor injuries.

The tour group headed for Shandong Saturday and was originally
scheduled to return July 21. But the Hifly spokesman said the
tour group has decided to cancel all of its remaining travel
itinerary and will return home as soon as possible. The national
travel agent association will assist in handling travel fee
refunds issues, the spokesman said.

Meanwhile, the quasi-official Straits Exchanges Foundation (SEF)
said it will help families of the deceased and injured tourists
to travel to China as soon as possible to take care of relevant
affairs. A SEF official said the families will be able to head
for Jinan Monday. All injured tourists are receiving treatment at
a hospital in downtown Jinan.
