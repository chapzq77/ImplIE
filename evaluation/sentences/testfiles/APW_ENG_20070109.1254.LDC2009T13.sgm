Italian authorities are seeking the arrest of a British woman
suspected of helping her husband, a convicted Mafia boss, run his
underworld business empire from prison, police said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
A judge signed an arrest warrant on a charge of mafia association
for Ann Hathaway, 44, of Middleton, a town near Manchester, said
Maj. Bartolomeo Di Niso, a Carabinieri paramilitary police
official who led the investigation in the Sicilian town of Gela.
</P>
<P>
Hathaway's warrant was signed on the eve of Dec. 10-11 raids that
took place across Italy and led to 87 arrests among alleged
members of the clan led by her husband, Antonio Rinzivillo. Both
Hathaway and another suspect who was sought in the raids are
believed to be abroad, Di Niso said.
</P>
<P>
Interpol is dealing with Hathaway's case and her exact
whereabouts is unknown, he said in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors believe Hathaway worked as a go-between for her
husband, who is serving a life sentence for murder in the
northern Italian town of Tolmezzo.
</P>
<P>
Hathaway would speak in code while visiting with Rinzivillo and
with her brother-in-law, Gino Rinzivillo, who is imprisoned in
Rome, Di Niso said. She allegedly then relayed orders to mobsters
who were managing the clan's nationwide business interests,
including extortion, loan-sharking and money laundering, the
police official said.
