PITTSBURGH 2007-08-09 21:38:47 UTC

<P>
The supermarket chain Giant Eagle Inc. won a bankruptcy court
auction Thursday with a $20 million (euro14.57 million) bid to
buy the shuttered Latrobe bottling facility of bankrupt drinks
maker Le-Nature's Inc.
</P>
<P>
The regional company edged out the beverage arm of U.K.-based
Cadbury Schweppes PLC, which entered a $19 million (euro13.84
million) offer last week that it declined to increase during the
brief hearing.
</P>
<P>
Le-Nature's was forced into bankruptcy last year after a judge
ruled that founder and chief executive Gregory J. Podlucky and
other directors may have committed accounting fraud. A federal
investigation is under way.
</P>
<P>
The flagship plant closed in November, leaving 240 employees out
of work. Creditors say the company racked up debts of more than
$820 million (euro597.28 million), according to court documents.
</P>
<P>
Giant Eagle plans to begin operating the facility in about eight
weeks and hire some 50 people to work there, according to Dick
Roberts, a spokesman for the company. Former Le-Nature's
employees will be given special consideration, he said.
</P>
<P>
"It's hoped numbers (of employees) will increase," he said.
</P>
<P>
The facility about 35 miles (56 kms) southeast of Pittsburgh
initially will be used to produce Giant Eagle's branded bottled
water, teas and other beverages. It will also be used for outside
contract work, Roberts said.
</P>
<P>
A court-appointed trustee of Le-Nature's earlier agreed to sell
the plant to Giant Eagle $20 million (euro14.57 million) before
the company lowered its bid to $18.9 million (euro13.77 million)
after reviewing the property.
</P>
<P>
Daniel Shapira, an attorney representing the O'Hara Township-
based chain, renewed the $20 million bid during Thursday's
auction before U.S. Bankruptcy Court Chief Judge M. Bruce
McCullough.
</P>
<P>
He said the company had spent more than $500,000 (euro364,192)
researching the proposed acquisition, which would include
property, equipment, inventory and government permits, among
other assets.
</P>
<P>
The $20 million from the sale will be divided among creditors and
companies that leased equipment to Le-Nature's.
