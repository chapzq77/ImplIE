In the new comedy ``Wild Hogs,'' Tim Allen, John Travolta,
William H. Macy and Martin Lawrence play weekend warrior buddies
from Cincinnati who jump on their Harleys and take a road trip to
the Pacific in hopes of pepping up their humdrum suburban lives.
</P>
<P>
Although filled with slapstick and more than a few off-color
jokes, the movie's underlying theme is how many baby boomers feel
that they have compromised their values while losing the idealism
of their youth.
</P>
<P>
``We thought we could change the world and, to be fair, we did
change the world,'' said Macy. ``We stopped the war. We got rid
of the president and we changed everything. But life overtook us.
And there are hundreds of thousands of Harley riders who are
trying to regain that feeling.''
</P>
<P>
``The revolutionary . . . becomes the establishment,'' said
Allen. ``We would have burned down a stage had it been sponsored
by Pepsi Cola. The new generation of musicians, the first thing
they do is attach themselves to the corporation. We were anti-
establishment, and we became a bigger more powerful
establishment. We became what we hated.''
</P>
<P>
In the film, which opens Friday, Allen's Doug is happily married
with a young son but is bored with his mundane job as a dentist;
Travolta's fast-talking Woody has lost his swimsuit model wife,
his fortune and his job; Macy's Dudley is a computer nerd who is
too shy to talk to women; and Lawrence's Bobby is a henpecked
plumber.
</P>
<P>
Director Walt Becker -- who at 38 is too young to be a true
boomer -- said that every generation goes through crisis points.
``I had one after college. I just took a year and a half off to
travel and thought, What do I want to do in my life? I think what
was neat about the movie is that the (characters) are asking
themselves that question: Where is my life going and should I
make a change?''
</P>
<P>
All three actors, as well as Becker, had a history with
motorcycles.
</P>
<P>
``I financed my college education by buying and selling Harleys
with my father,'' said Becker. ``We would buy mainly, like,
mid-'70s Shovelheads and fix them up here and ship them over to
Europe in parts. I had a cousin there who was a mechanic and he
would reassemble them. Once we got there we would ride these
bikes around with a bunch of friends and sell them for, like,
four or five times what we paid for them.''
</P>
<P>
His father, he added, was a weekend warrior biker just like the
Hogs.
</P>
<P>
``He's a psychologist and a Baptist minister,'' said Becker, who
was born and raised in Pasadena. ``When he was, like, in his mid-
to late 40s, his friend had this idea -- we're getting 40 guys
together, we are going to fly to Wisconsin, buy Harleys and drive
them across the U.S. for two weeks. My dad got his ear pierced
and bought skull bandanas. I said, `Dad I hope you don't get
killed. You are such a poseur.' ''
</P>
<P>
Travolta has been riding motorcycles since he was a struggling
young actor in Los Angeles in the early 1970s.
</P>
<P>
``It was economical transportation in California,'' he said. ``I
would run around to my auditions in a motorcycle. You would store
it easily when you left town.''
</P>
<P>
He still borrows friends' Harleys to ride. ``For years I had a
Honda 450, which is a moderate-sized bike,'' said Travolta. ``I
am looking forward to owning a Harley again.''
</P>
<P>
Travolta is passionate about bikes because there's a certain
sensation to riding a bike. ``Your body gets exhilarated and you
get excited physically. There's a mental freedom from imagined
barriers that you have.''
</P>
<P>
Just like Travolta, Macy tooled around Los Angeles on a
motorcycle in the 1970s. But because he was rusty and had never
ridden a Harley, Macy took lessons from the film's stunt
coordinator, Jack Gill. It was love at first sight for Macy and
his machine.
</P>
<P>
``Macy took to it like a fish to water,'' recalled Becker.
</P>
<P>
``There is nothing like it, man,'' enthused Macy. ``It is as
close to flying as you get on the ground. It feels fantastic. It
has a little bit of the patina of the outlaw about it, and there
is the nature aspect of it.
</P>
<P>
''If you want to really see a place, get on a motorcycle.``
