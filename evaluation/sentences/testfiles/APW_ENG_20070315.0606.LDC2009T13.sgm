Saturday

GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip 2007-03-15 10:31:34 UTC

<P>
The rival Hamas and Fatah movements put the final touches on a
Palestinian unity government Thursday, but Israel quickly
condemned the coalition as a "step backward" and said it would
try to rally international opposition to it.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian factions hope their alliance will end bloody
internal fighting and lead the Palestinian government out of
international isolation. But the Israeli reaction signaled
trouble for the unity plan. Western countries have said they are
waiting for the new government to take office before deciding
whether to lift their economic sanctions against the Palestinian
government.
</P>
<P>
Hamas and Fatah leaders wrapped up months of tortuous coalition
talks late Wednesday, saying they would present their coalition
to parliament for approval on Saturday. On Thursday, Prime
Minister Ismail Haniyeh of Hamas was to present the list of
Cabinet ministers to President Mahmoud Abbas.
</P>
<P>
"Today is an occasion to celebrate. We have done everything,"
Haniyeh said late Wednesday, after a late-night meeting with
President Mahmoud Abbas of Fatah.
</P>
<P>
Haniyeh and Abbas agreed to the power-sharing deal last month in
Saudi Arabia, but had spent the past few weeks ironing out the
final details. Clearing the final obstacle, the men agreed on the
appointment of a new interior minister, a sensitive post that
oversees several powerful security forces.
</P>
<P>
Officials identified the new minister as Hani Kawasmi, a senior
Interior Ministry civil servant who has good relations with Hamas
and Fatah, but does not belong to either party. Mustafa
Barghouti, the incoming information minister, confirmed the
appointment.
</P>
<P>
Barghouti said other key appointments included Salam Fayyad, an
internationally respected economist, as finance minister, and
Ziad Abu Amr, an independent lawmaker, as foreign minister.
Haniyeh will remain as prime minister, and Azzam al-Ahmed, head
of Fatah's parliament bloc, will be deputy prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Haniyeh planned to formally announce the Cabinet on Thursday. In
all, Hamas will get nine Cabinet posts and Fatah will get six.
</P>
<P>
Israel and the Quartet of Mideast peace makers -- the U.S., EU,
U.N. and Russia -- have said Hamas must renounce violence,
recognize Israel's right to exist and accept past peace
agreements.
</P>
<P>
The government platform, posted on Hamas and Fatah web sites,
includes only a vague pledge to "respect" past peace deals,
falling short of explicit recognition of Israel.
</P>
<P>
The government program also affirms the Palestinians' right to
resist and "defend themselves against any Israeli aggression." At
the same time, the platform calls for maintaining and expanding a
truce with Israel.
</P>
<P>
While many in the West consider "resistance" to be a code word
for violent attacks, the Palestinians have a much vaguer
definition, including anything from armed attacks to street
protests.
</P>
<P>
In the first Israeli reaction to the deal, a senior Israeli
government official on Thursday called it a "step backward" for
peace prospects. The official who spoke on condition of anonymity
pending a formal Israeli announcement said Israel would try to
rally international opposition to the government.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian officials urged the international community to give
the government a chance, despite misgivings about Hamas. Israel,
the U.S, and European Union consider the Islamic militant group,
which has killed scored of Israelis in suicide bombings, a
terrorist group.
</P>
<P>
"We call on all parties, including the Arabs, to work and live
with this government, and to give it an opportunity," Nabil Abu
Rdeneh, an Abbas aide, said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The incoming deputy prime minister, Azzam al-Ahmed, said he hoped
the Arab world and the European Union would try to "pressure the
U.S. and Israel to change their position" against the new
coalition.
</P>
<P>
Hamas trounced the more moderate Fatah in parliamentary elections
last year, giving it control over most government functions. But
the Hamas-led government was crippled by Western sanctions
imposed over its refusal to recognize Israel's right to exist.
</P>
<P>
Abbas, who was elected separately in 2005, has been pushing Hamas
since last autumn to join Fatah in a more moderate coalition in
hopes of lifting the Western boycott. The negotiations collapsed
repeatedly, often sparking rounds of deadly factional fighting in
Gaza.
</P>
<P>
As negotiations continued, there was an exchange of fire between
Hamas and Fatah forces in the northern Gaza Strip. Security
officials said nine people, including five bystanders, were
slightly wounded in the shootout. More than 130 people have died
in the infighting since last May.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, a Fatah activist died of wounds he sustained the
previous night in a shootout with Hamas gunmen in the northern
Gaza Strip, Palestinian security officials said.
</P>
<P>
Fears of bloodshed led Abbas to agree to the power-sharing deal
at talks in Saudi Arabia last month, even though the agreement
falls short of the international demands to renounce violence,
recognize Israel and accept past peace agreements.
</P>
<P>
Abbas has told Western powers that the deal -- which includes a
vague pledge to "respect" past agreements with Israel -- is the
best he could get from the militant group.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian factions were eager to complete the coalition
talks ahead of an Arab summit later this month in Saudi Arabia,
where they hope to win wider recognition and funding for their
new government.
</P>
<P>
Also, U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice is expected in the
region at the end of next week as part of a push to restart peace
efforts.
