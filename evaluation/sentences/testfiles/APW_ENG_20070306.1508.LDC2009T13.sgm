LONDON 2007-03-06 19:01:22 UTC

<P>
The brown cloak worn by Obi Wan Kenobi in the "Star Wars" trilogy
-- and then forgotten for years in a warehouse -- was among 400
costumes sold Tuesday at a major auction of movie and television
memorabilia.
</P>
<P>
It sold for 54,000 pounds (US$104,000; euro79,000) to an
anonymous telephone bidder.
</P>
<P>
Audience members raised their paddles in rapid succession as
costumes flashed across television screens at Bonhams, a British
auctioneer, as staff fielded telephone bids from all over the
world. When the hammer dropped over a Bond girl's cat-suit or
Anthony Hopkins' army uniform, men in dark blazers whispered the
prices into their cell phones.
</P>
<P>
"It's nerve-racking, of course it is," costume collector Kamran
Raja said as the outfits from "Evita" were auctioned off. He made
a bid, paying 2,700 pounds (US$5,200; euro4,000) to add a fur-
lined dressing gown from the movie to his 40-piece collection,
which he said included one of Madonna's bras.
</P>
<P>
"I just aged 20 years in two minutes," he said.
</P>
<P>
Some of the more eye-catching costumes -- including William
Wallace's (Mel Gibson's) kilt from "Braveheart" and James Bond's
dinner jacket from "Thunderball," were modeled by Bonhams staff.
Sean Connery's stand-in grinned mischievously as the audience
made its bids, while a blonde Supergirl, dressed in a blue
elastic leotard and red knee-high boots, struggled to keep a
straight face as the audience competed for her costume.
</P>
<P>
While most of the bidders were dealers or collectors, a few were
looking for a cheap conversation piece from a famous film or
actor, Bonhams specialist Stephanie Connell said.
</P>
<P>
"You might just wear a suit to a dinner party and say, 'Look,
it's a Michael Caine suit.'" But she said the big ticket items,
like the Bond dinner jacket -- which sold for 33,600 pounds
(US$64,700; euro49,400) -- would probably see never see another
martini again.
</P>
<P>
The costumes came from Angels The Costumiers, whose chairman Tim
Angel said was trying to cut insurance costs by selling some of
the outfits from its 1.5 million-strong collection.
</P>
<P>
The auction's main attraction, the hooded cloak worn by Alec
Guinness in "Star Wars" had lain unnoticed in the company's
inventory -- and rented out for costume parties -- until its
provenance was discovered last year.
</P>
<P>
"How would anyone have known when that film was made that it
would attain cult status?" Angel said. Among the items the
company did keep track of was the beaten metal helmet worn by Sir
Bedevere (Terry Jones) in "Monty Python and the Holy Grail." It
sold for 10,000 pounds (US$19,300; euro14,700) -- 20 times more
than its pre-sale estimate.
</P>
<P>
Raja, the pop costume collector, was mystified.
</P>
<P>
"It's just a metal bucket," he said, shaking his head.
