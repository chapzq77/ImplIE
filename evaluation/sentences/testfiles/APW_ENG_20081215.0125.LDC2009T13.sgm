Members of Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin's church gathered in high
spirits at a middle school Sunday, two days after their building
was badly damaged by a fire authorities are investigating as
arson.
</P>
<P>
Palin, the former Republican vice presidential candidate, did not
attend services Sunday because she was in Juneau preparing to
propose a state budget, said her spokesman, Bill McAllister.
</P>
<P>
The congregation realizes the church is more than the building,
said John Doak, associate pastor at Wasilla Bible Church.
</P>
<P>
"The definition of the church is the body of Christ, made up of
God's people," Doak said after the hourlong service at Wasilla
Middle School attended by about 1,200 people. "The church is
still there. We are the church."
</P>
<P>
Damage to the 2 1/2-year-old church building is estimated at $1
million. The blaze was set at the main entrance Friday night
while a small group, including two children, were inside. No one
was injured.
</P>
<P>
Fire Chief James Steele said the blaze is being investigated as
an arson.
</P>
<P>
Patsy Inks said the news initially shocked and frustrated her.
But by Sunday, she was feeling blessed, she said at the school,
where worshippers lingered over a potluck dinner for a church
family leaving Alaska.
</P>
<P>
"This tragedy has brought us all together," Inks said, her eyes
tearing up.
</P>
<P>
Palin, who was not at the church at the time of the fire, stopped
by Saturday. According to McAllister, Palin told an assistant
pastor she was sorry if the fire was connected to the "undeserved
negative attention" the church has received since she became the
vice presidential candidate Aug. 29.
</P>
<P>
Worshippers acknowledged the possible Palin connection with the
fire, but more in a "gee, maybe" sort of way, said Rob Tracy, who
shuttled people to the school for services. But people are
speculating about other motives.
</P>
<P>
"It's just as likely to be some troubled person who has a beef
with God," Tracy said.
</P>
<P>
"Or some local punks," Doak said.
</P>
<P>
After Palin was named John McCain's running mate, the evangelical
church was the subject of intense scrutiny. Early in her
campaign, Palin's church was criticized for promoting in a Sunday
bulletin a Focus on the Family "Love Won Out Conference" in
Anchorage.
</P>
<P>
The conference promised to "help men and women dissatisfied with
living homosexually understand that same-sex attractions can be
overcome."
</P>
<P>
Wasilla, the governor's hometown, is 40 miles (64 kilometers)
north of Anchorage.
