Austrian authorities say a small earthquake set off a large World
War II-era bomb in the garden of a Vienna home. No one was
injured in the explosion.
</P>
<P>
Investigators think the bomb weighed up to 500 kilograms (half a
ton). It lay buried for decades in the garden, and no one knew it
was there.
</P>
<P>
But when a minor quake shook parts of the Austrian capital, the
bomb exploded.
</P>
<P>
Officials say the homeowner heard a dull bang Friday evening and
went outside to see what happened. Experts were still on the
scene Saturday to examine the crater left by the blast.
</P>
<P>
Unexploded ordnance from World War II remains strewn across
Austria.
