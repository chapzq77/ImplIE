US leads world outrage at Beirut bombing
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The United States led a global chorus of outrage Wednesday at the
slaying of an anti-Syrian Lebanese lawmaker in Beirut and warned
Syria and Iran against trying to destabilize their smaller
neighbor.
</P>
<P>
"I strongly condemn today's horrific assassination of Lebanese
member of parliament Antoine Ghanem," said Bush, who cited "a
tragic pattern" of attacks against champions of "an independent
and democratic Lebanon."
</P>
<P>
"We will continue to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with the Lebanese
people, as they resist attempts by the Syrian and Iranian regimes
and their allies to destabilize Lebanon and undermine its
sovereignty," he said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Britain, France, Greece, Italy, Russia, Spain, Canada, the United
Arab Emirates and the United Nations also denounced the car
bombing, which plunged deeply divided Lebanon into further chaos
days ahead of crucial elections.
</P>
<P>
The European Union condemned the killing as a "contemptible act,"
while urging the Lebanese government to go ahead with a hotly
contested September 25 presidential contest.
</P>
<P>
Ghanem's murder was the latest in a string of attacks since
October 2004 against prominent critics of Lebanon's neighbor and
former powerbroker Syria, and his colleagues were quick to point
the finger of blame at Damascus.
</P>
<P>
"Today's cowardly attack comes days before the Lebanese
parliament is scheduled to convene to elect a new president,"
Bush said.
</P>
<P>
"There has been a tragic pattern of political assassinations and
attempted assassinations designed to silence those Lebanese who
courageously defend their vision of an independent and democratic
Lebanon."
</P>
<P>
The United States opposes any attempts to intimidate the Lebanese
people as they seek to exercise their democratic right to select
a president without foreign interference," he said.
</P>
<P>
Syria denied any involvement, saying the bombing was a "criminal
act" aimed at undermining efforts at a rapprochement with
Lebanon, while Beirut launched its own investigation.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese Prime Minister Fuad Siniora also urged UN Secretary
General Ban Ki-moon to open an international probe into the
bombing, which left five others dead and wounded more than 50 in
a Christian neighborhood of Beirut.
</P>
<P>
Bush said the international community had to support "efforts to
bring to justice the perpetrators of these violent attacks, and
to stand with the citizens of Lebanon who continue to struggle to
protect their freedom."
</P>
<P>
Asked whether Damascus was involved, White House spokeswoman Dana
Perino said she was "not prepared to assign blame" but insisted
"there's been a pattern and this would seem to fit into the
pattern."
</P>
<P>
US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said the bombing was
"another act in a campaign of terror by those who want to turn
back the clock on Lebanon's hard won democratic gains."
</P>
<P>
"Enemies of peace and freedom want to gain through violence,
threat and intimidation what they cannot win in free and fair
elections," she said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"The world should speak with one voice in calling for an end to
violence in Lebanon intended to subvert democratic processes in
that country."
</P>
<P>
British Foreign Secretary David Miliband condemned what he called
a "ruthless attempt to destabilize Lebanon" before critical
September 5 elections to pick a successor to Syria-backed
President Emile Lahoud.
</P>
<P>
French President Nicolas Sarkozy expressed personal "sadness and
anger" at what he described as a "targeted attack."
</P>
<P>
"All light must be shed on the circumstances of this heinous
crime and its perpetrators must be brought to justice," said
Sarkozy, who, like Washington, linked it to other high-profile
assassinations of anti-Syrian Lebanese leaders.
</P>
<P>
France and the United States have led international efforts to
curb Syrian influence in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Russia said "the organizers and perpetrators must be found and
punished" while Italy denounced the bombing as a "terrorist
attack" aimed at "destabilizing Lebanese political life at a
particularly delicate time."
</P>
<P>
Canada said it stood "firmly" by Siniora and called the bombing
an "attack on Lebanonâ€™s independence, stability and democracy,
especially in view of the upcoming elections."
</P>
<P>
"I urge the people of Lebanon to continue to resist those who
seek to destabilize their country and to pursue their efforts to
find a political solution to the current crisis," Foriegn
Minister Maxime Bernier said.
</P>
<P>
Ghanem, a member of the Phalange party of former president Amin
Gemayel, was the eighth member of the ruling anti-Syrian majority
to be assassinated since the 2005 murder of former billionaire
prime minister Rafiq Hariri.
</P>
<P>
Ghanem's death has reduced the anti-Syrian majority in parliament
to 68 members out of the now 127-member house, amid a near-
complete deadlock between the Western-backed ruling majority and
the pro-Damascus opposition.
