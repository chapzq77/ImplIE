ATLANTA --If you have to pay $3.50 for a gallon of gasoline, you
may as well have fun, and look good, while you're burning it. The
2008 Nissan 350Z is flat-out fun to drive, built for sunny days
and back-country roads. Unlike another fun-to-drive roadster from
Japan, there isn't an ounce of cute in the looks of this car. The
350Z isn't big, but it's bad-looking. And by bad, of course, we
mean good. But you can see that.

CAR AND DRIVER
</P>
<P>
On the worst road surfaces, the 350Z keeps going where the driver
points it, but the way the suspension bucks ? requires a certain
amount of faith from the driver that the car will stay planted.
Think of the 350Z as a Japanese Corvette. It has plenty of speed
at a good price but lacks the refinement needed for all-around
greatness.
</P>
<P>
WHAT'S SPECIAL: No matter what gear you're in, no matter what the
speedometer says, you feel you can go a lot faster just by
stomping the gas pedal. The 3.5-liter V-6 cranks out 306
horsepower, and that power is accessible throughout the rpm
range. A radar detector might be a handy accessory to have should
you buy this car.
</P>
<P>
WHAT WE LIKE: The 350Z is a sports car with steering as precise
as a laser. It handles as well as German roadsters costing about
$10,000 more. The six-speed stick shifts quick and sure. The soft
top of the roadster folds down in about 20 seconds.
</P>
<P>
WHAT ISN'T THERE: Storage room. The trunk will hold a couple of
overnight bags, but you're unlikely to fit a set of golf clubs in
there. There isn't much storage space in the cabin either. You'll
have to be judicious in your CD selection for any road trip.
</P>
<P>
YOU OUGHTA KNOW: For the serious midlife crisis, consider the
NISMO 350Z, a coupe with an aggressively stylish aerodynamic
package that includes front spoiler. It also offers a sportier
suspension package and heavy-duty Brembo brakes. The NISMO is
available only with a six-speed manual transmission. And would
you want it any other way?
</P>
<P>
EXTRAS: The roadster interior is more Spartan than luxurious, but
offers the necessities of life: automatic temperature control,
six-speaker sound system and well-designed steering wheel
controls for sound and cruise control. The driver's seat offers
good lateral support to keep you in place through the curves, but
the upholstery seems a bit thin to be comfy all day. The safety
package includes seat-mounted side-impact air bags.

The 2008 Nissan 350Z offers performance equal to some of the best
sports cars available. The V-6 is quite docile, though, and
opening it up a bit produces an enjoyable and throaty growl.
Power delivery is linear and athletic and particularly
entertaining at higher revs. ? A manual transmission brings out
the most in the car.
