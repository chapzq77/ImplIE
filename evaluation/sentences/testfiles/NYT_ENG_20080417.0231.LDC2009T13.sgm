SUICIDE BOMBER KILLS 23 OUTSIDE MOSQUE IN REMOTE AFGHAN PROVINCE
Taimoor Shah contributed reporting from Kandahar, Afghanistan.
KABUL, Afghanistan
</P>
<P>
A suicide bomber struck outside a mosque in southwestern
Afghanistan on Thursday, killing 23 people, including two senior
police officials and several children, officials said Thursday
evening.
</P>
<P>
An estimated 31 people were wounded in the explosion, which
occurred just before evening prayers in the border town of
Zaranj, the capital of Nimruz Province.
</P>
<P>
Nimruz is a remote desert area, sparsely populated and poorly
policed, where traffickers smuggle drugs across into neighboring
Iran. There has also been an increase in insurgent activity in
the province.
</P>
<P>
Many of those killed and wounded were civilians, shopkeepers and
guests at a hotel, the provincial governor, Ghulam Dastagir Azad,
said by telephone.
</P>
<P>
He said he believed that police officials had been the bomber's
targets. One of those killed was Bismillah Khan, a district
police chief, and another was the commander of a battalion of
border guards, he said.
</P>
<P>
"They are the enemy of the poor people, the enemy of human
beings," the governor said of the attackers.
</P>
<P>
Also on Thursday, the American military said that two U.S.
Marines from a unit that arrived last month had been killed and
that two were wounded Wednesday morning when an explosion hit
their convoy in the southern province of Kandahar.
</P>
<P>
Under NATO rules their nationality was not released immediately,
said Capt. Kelly Frushour, the unit's public affairs officer. She
gave few details of the episode except to say it had been a
hostile attack, and that the wounded were being sent to the
American military base at Landstuhl, Germany.
</P>
<P>
The Marines came from the 24th Marine Expeditionary Unit, a force
of 3,200 that was sent to Afghanistan recently to help NATO
troops faced with a continued insurgency in southern and eastern
Afghanistan. NATO commanders in Afghanistan have called for more
forces repeatedly over the last two years, but were rebuffed
until the Marine unit arrived.
</P>
<P>
The Marines came with their own artillery, helicopters and
Harrier fighter planes, and were expected to add considerable
combat capability to the NATO forces, which have struggled to
contain the Taliban insurgency since being deployed in 2006.
</P>
<P>
About 2,200 of the Marines will work with NATO forces and serve
as a task force capable of being used across the country as
needed. The remaining 1,000 will provide training and support for
the Afghan army and police forces under U.S. command.
</P>
<P>
The Marine unit has been stationed at an air base just outside
the city of Kandahar, and has yet to see combat.
</P>
<P>
In comments reported in The Baltimore Sun, members of the unit
complained recently that the slow and cumbersome NATO command
structure had delayed them from being utilized, and that they had
been wasting time on the base rather than fighting insurgents.
