Palin urges Republican governors: check Democrats

Sarah Palin called on fellow Republican governors Thursday to
keep the new president and his strengthened Democratic majority
in check on issues from taxes to health care.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the Republican Governors Association, the vice
presidential nominee on Senator John McCain's ticket -- and an
oft-mentioned candidate for 2012 -- talked about the role of the
party's state governors after the Republicans lost the White
House and several seats in the Senate and House.
</P>
<P>
"We are the minority party," Palin said. "Let us resolve not to
be the negative party."
</P>
<P>
Palin never mentioned the name of President-elect Barack Obama,
but she took a swipe or two at the Democrat. She said with
governors, "the buck stops on our desk. ... We are not the many
voting yea or nay or present." While an Illinois state lawmaker,
Obama often voted "present," a practice the Republicans
criticized during the campaign.
</P>
<P>
Palin noted Congress said it was incumbent upon Republican
governors to ensure that the Democratic-led federal government
doesn't take over the health care system.
</P>
<P>
She said if Obama and the new Congress "err on the side of excess
taxes, we have to show them the way."
</P>
<P>
Facing the prospect of being out of power at both ends of
Pennsylvania Avenue for the first time since 1992, Republicans
are looking to their governors to fill the leadership vacuum.
</P>
<P>
Speculation has centered on the telegenic Palin despite her
tumultuous two months on the national political scene. She likely
would have competition for a possible 2012 bid from several of
the governors attending the three-day meeting.
</P>
<P>
One likely candidate Mississippi Governor Haley Barbour told his
colleagues Wednesday that now isn't the time to think about the
next presidential election.
</P>
<P>
"Anybody here tonight that has thought about the 2012
presidential election needs to keep their eye on the ball,"
Barbour, a former Republican Party chairman, told a reception for
the governors and their supporters. "We don't need to talk about
2012."
</P>
<P>
In a series of national television interviews, Palin did not rule
out seeking the presidency, saying, "It's crazy to close a door
before you know what's even open in front of you."
</P>
<P>
Asked about the 2012 talk at a news conference Thursday morning,
Palin said, "I, like all of our governors, we're focused on the
future. The future for us is not the 2012 presidential race. It's
next year and our next budget, and the next reforms in our states
and in 2010 we're going to have 36 governors' positions open
across the U.S. That's what we're focused on."
