World Bank increases budget supports for Mozambique
</P>
<P>
MAPUTO, Nov. 12 (Xinhua) -- The Mozambican government and the
World Bank have signed in Maputo two agreements whereby the Bank
is to grant 100 million U.S. dollars to support the Mozambican
state budget for 2009 and help it respond to the high cost of
foodstuffs.
</P>
<P>
Of the total amount. 90 million dollars which will be disbursed
by July 2009, is a loan to support the state budget, and the
remainder is a grant to help the food production to guarantee
Mozambican food security, according to local media AIM on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
This is a very substantial increase in direct budget supports
from the World Bank. The Bank has provided budget support of 70
million dollars this year, and the pledge made in May was that
the same amount would be provided in 2009.
</P>
<P>
The documents were signed by Planning and Development Minister
Aiuba Cuereneia and World Bank regional director Michael Baxter.
</P>
<P>
At the ceremony, Baxter said that this money is aiming at
sustaining high levels of growth through actions to facilitate
and deepen institutional reforms in the areas of macro-economic
and public financial management and procurement.
</P>
<P>
The 90 million dollar budget support credit comes from the
International Development Association, the World Bank's soft
loans arm, and was approved by the Bank's Executive Board a week
ago.
</P>
<P>
It is the Fifth Poverty Reduction Support Credit to Mozambique
and will support implement phase two of the government's Action
Plan for the Reduction of Absolute Poverty.
