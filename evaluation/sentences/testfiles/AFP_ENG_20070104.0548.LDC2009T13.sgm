Bush to appoint new Iraq commanders
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
US President George W. Bush reportedly plans to appoint two top
new commanders for Iraq before unveiling a shift in strategy for
the strife-torn nation that may include increasing the number of
US troops.
</P>
<P>
The US television network ABC said Thursday that Bush intends to
nominate Admiral William Fallon, head of US Pacific Command, to
replace General John Abizaid at US Central Command, which has
responsibility for the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
It said General George Casey, the US military commander in Iraq,
would be replaced by Lieutenant General David Petraeus, who has
played a major role in the training of Iraqi security forces.
</P>
<P>
Abizaid, 55, announced last month that he planned to retire early
this year and ABC said Casey, 58, would probably leave in the
next few months, earlier than a planned June departure.
</P>
<P>
"The president wants a clean sweep," an unidentified US official
told ABC.
</P>
<P>
Both Abizaid and Casey have expressed reservations about a
reported plan to increase the number of US troops in Iraq from
the current 140,000.
</P>
<P>
According to US media reports, Bush could announce an increase of
US forces in Iraq on the order of 9,000 to 40,000 extra troops in
a bid to end sectarian strife and restore security.
</P>
<P>
ABC said the military nominations would be announced next week,
before Bush delivers his speech on strategy for an increasingly
unpopular US war in Iraq that has cost the lives of some 3,000 US
servicemen.
</P>
<P>
As a naval officer, ABC said the appointment of Fallon to head
Central Command and oversee ground wars in Iraq and Afghanistan
would be "highly unusual."
</P>
<P>
The appointments come as Bush pursues an aggressive overhaul
among his top military, diplomatic and intelligence aides.
</P>
<P>
He is expected to announce Friday that he is moving Director of
National Intelligence John Negroponte to the State Department as
deputy to Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice.
</P>
<P>
He also will nominate next week Zalmay Khalilzad, the US
ambassador to Iraq, to be the new top US diplomat at the United
Nations, a senior US official said. The appointments are subject
to Senate confirmation.
</P>
<P>
Fallon, 62, who is tipped to replace Abizaid, was a navy combat
pilot during the Vietnam War, commanded an attack squadron during
the first Gulf War in 1991 and was involved in NATO's Operation
Deliberate Force in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
As head of Central Command, he would oversee US forces from North
Africa to Central Asia.
</P>
<P>
Petraeus, 54, currently serves as the commander of the US Army
Combined Arms Center at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.
</P>
<P>
From June 2004 to September 2005 he was in charge of training the
new Iraqi Army and security forces, an initiative which Bush has
identified as a priority if the United States is going to reduce
its troop strength in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Petraeus commanded the 101st Airborne Division during the 2003
invasion of Iraq and was widely praised for his subsequent work
administering the northern city of Mosul.
