Ticket crunch beginning for game at Wembley

NEW YORK 2007-05-15 23:19:15 UTC

<P>
The grousing by some National Football League fans over the first
regular-season game to be played overseas might not be limited to
the western side of the Atlantic Ocean.
</P>
<P>
More than half a million ticket requests poured in soon after
league commissioner Roger Goodell announced the New York Giants
would play the Miami Dolphins at the new Wembley Stadium in
London.
</P>
<P>
That outpouring of interest for the Oct. 28 contest means many
die-hard fans -- not to mention the curious observers the game is
intended to reach -- will be stuck watching on TV.
</P>
<P>
"This is a game for Europe and a game for hardcore fans of both
teams," said Alistair Kirkwood, managing director of NFL UK.
</P>
<P>
"The challenge we've got is to keep all the various stakeholders
happy."
</P>
<P>
Ticket preference will go to season ticket holders and members of
fan clubs, particularly in the United Kingdom. About 10,000 fans
are expected to travel from the United States, only a fraction of
the 90,000 capacity.
</P>
<P>
Tickets go on sale in Europe on Monday and within the next week
in the United States, but fewer than half will be immediately
available. The rest will go on sale once team and league
officials weigh the amount of interest the game generates among
American fans and those abroad.
</P>
<P>
Giants co-owner Jonathan Tisch said the club has received about
3,500 requests.
</P>
<P>
For those lucky enough to get a ticket, the game won't be cheap.
Prices range from about $90 (euro66.50) to $180 (euro133), using
a pricing structure similar to this weekend's FA Cup final
between Manchester United and Chelsea.
</P>
<P>
"When I was in Miami, one of the British journalists came up to
me in the dour, sour way that most of the journalists have in
Britain," London Mayor Ken Livingstone said. "He said, 'Wouldn't
it be humiliating if there are a bunch of empty seats?' And I
said, 'I suspect that won't be the case.'"
</P>
<P>
The game, which will kick off at 6 p.m. London time -- 1 p.m. on
the East Coast of the United States -- comes after Arizona beat
San Francisco in Mexico City in 2005. The league hopes to play
regular-season games again in Mexico, as well as Canada and other
cities in Europe in an effort to expand the game globally.
