Siemens probed over Iraq food-for-oil programme: report
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
German industrial group Siemens is being investigated on
suspicion of corruption in the oil-for-food programme in Iraq,
the Financial Times Deutschland claimed on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The paper, which released an advance extract of its Wednesday
edition,  quoted a spokesman for the state prosecutor in
Nuremberg as saying: "The prosecutor is investigating whether
Siemens contravened the law on foreign trade."
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the allegations against Siemens concerned
mainly its energy and medical equipment operations and involved a
six-figure sum, meaning at least 100,000 euros (133,000 dollars).
</P>
<P>
The money was allegedly paid as a bribe to Saddam Hussein's
regime to secure contracts as part of the UN-supervised food-for-
oil programme which ran from late-1996 to 2003.
</P>
<P>
The programme allowed the Iraqi government to sell limited
amounts of oil to purchase essential goods to alleviate the
effects of sanctions on the civilian population.
</P>
<P>
In late December, state prosecutors in Munich said they had
opened an investigation into German oil giant Linde, which faces
similar accusations over the food-for-oil programme.
</P>
<P>
An investigation ordered by UN Secretary General Kofi Annan found
in 2005 that more than 2,000 companies from 60 countries bribed
Saddam Hussein's government to be allowed to take part in the
programme.
</P>
<P>
Siemens is also facing an investigation by German prosecutors
over alleged embezzlement, bribery and tax evasion.
</P>
<P>
Some employees are suspected of collaborating in opening slush
fund accounts abroad, which are used for making illicit payments,
and of operating a system to embezzle company money.
</P>
<P>
Seven former and current employees were arrested late last year
but freed before Christmas after they made statements to
prosecutors.
