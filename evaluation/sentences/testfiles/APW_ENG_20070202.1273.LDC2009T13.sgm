WASHINGTON 2007-02-02 16:11:09 UTC

<P>
Democrats energized by their takeover of Congress began a
campaign to do the same with the U.S. presidency on Friday in the
first public gathering of all the party's White House hopefuls.
</P>
<P>
Sen. Barack Obama began his speech to members of the Democratic
National Committee with a joke about how the contest feels a
little like "American Idol" or "Survivor" reality shows. But he
quickly tried to tap into what he said is a sober mood in the
United States weighed down by the Iraq war and concerns about
health care and pensions.
</P>
<P>
He spoke softly and carried the crowd with his call for an honest
debate on the issues.
</P>
<P>
"Democrats, this is not a game," Obama said. "This can't be about
who digs up more skeletons on who, who makes the biggest slip-ups
on the campaign trail. We owe it to the American people to do
more than that. We owe them an election where voters are
inspired."
</P>
<P>
Obama said every candidate should pledge to provide health care
for all by the end of the next president's first term. He also
repeatedly reminded the largely anti-war crowd that he was
against the Iraq invasion from the beginning and said all
candidates, no matter where they stood at the start, have an
obligation to bring the troops home.
</P>
<P>
Other candidates tried to bring the crowd to its feet with sharp
jabs at Bush and memorable lines. Sen. Chris Dodd asked for a
chance to be heard in a race that includes stars Obama and New
York Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton. He offered a rousing promise to
reverse Bush's policies.
</P>
<P>
"Get the car out of the ditch, we aren't going to take fear for
an answer any more in America," Dodd said, bringing the crowd of
activists to its feet.
</P>
<P>
Dodd promised if elected he would bring troops out of Iraq,
overturn Bush's torture legislation and "begin to restore
America's leadership in the world." He said voters sent a clear
message in November that they wanted change in Iraq when they
elected Democratic majorities in the House and Senate, and they
deserve more than the nonbinding resolution being debated in the
Senate.
</P>
<P>
"Frankly, I'm disappointed that we can't do more than send a
meaningless message to the White House," Dodd said. "I don't
think that spending a week debating a nonbinding resolution is
the change that America voted for."
</P>
<P>
Four years ago, Howard Dean ignited the crowd with a fire-and-
brimstone speech in which he pointedly appealed to partisans
tired of a Democratic move to the middle by declaring he was from
"the Democratic wing of the Democratic party."
</P>
<P>
Dean, now the chairman of the DNC, started the gathering by
celebrating the party's reversal of fortune from minority to
majority in Congress and governor's offices. "We are in charge
again and we will really be in charge in 2008," Dean said.
</P>
<P>
Others scheduled to speak Friday included Clinton, Wesley Clark,
2004 vice presidential nominee John Edwards and Dennis Kucinich.
</P>
<P>
Saturday's lineup of speakers included Sen. Joseph Biden, New
Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson, former Alaska Sen. Mike Gravel and
former Iowa Gov. Tom Vilsack.
