Temple fires tenured professor who had complained about grade

PHILADELPHIA (AP)
</P>
<P>
A tenured math professor who complained Temple University wanted him
to inflate grades and ``dummy down'' course work has been fired on
grounds of incompetence, his attorney said.
</P>
<P>
Martin Eisen, 69, who worked at Temple for nearly 35 years, had been
on paid leave since August 1999 while the university investigated
students' complaints about his grading practices.
</P>
<P>
Three separate faculty committees reviewed 1,200 pages of testimony
before finding Eisen to be ``incompetent,'' Eisen's attorney, F.
Michael Daily Jr., said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
``Our position is that he is not incompetent,'' Daily said. ``What
Temple demanded that Dr. Eisen do ... was dummy down the course so
these kids would get college credit for a college-level course which
was really a high school course.''
</P>
<P>
University spokeswoman Harriet Goodheart refused to comment Wednesday,
calling it a personnel matter.
</P>
<P>
The firing of a tenured professor is a ``remarkably serious and
difficult decision, and you have to look at this with great care. And
I think that has happened,'' said economics professor Michael Goetz,
president of the Faculty Senate.
</P>
<P>
Daily claimed Eisen was fired because he refused to make the course
work easier or give students grades they did not deserve. Eisen's
students had a high failure rate and many of them complained, Daily
said.
</P>
<P>
Upset students have yelled obscenities at Eisen and physically blocked
the doorway to his class, Daily said.
</P>
<P>
Anticipating he would be fired, Eisen filed a federal civil rights
lawsuit against Temple last summer. He seeks reinstatement to his job,
back pay and other monetary damages. Temple has moved to get the
lawsuit dismissed.
</P>
<P>
Goetz maintained that classes at Temple have not been dumbed down. He
said grade inflation does exist, but no more than at ``any other
university in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
Grade inflation recently became an issue at Harvard University when a
university study found that nearly half of all grades awarded were A
or A-minus, a sharp increase from a decade earlier.
