U.S. gasoline stockpiles dropped 2.3 million barrels in the week
ended July 13, a weekly report by the statistical arm of the U.S.
Energy Department showed Wednesday. The average expectation had
been for a 560,000-barrel gain, according to an earlier Dow Jones
Newswires survey of analysts.

Gasoline demand over the previous four weeks has surged to record
levels, keeping the fuel as one of the leading drivers of oil
prices. Gasoline supplies have been a concern since a round of
refinery outages in the spring left the U.S. with supplies deemed
insufficient for the North American summer driving season.

Stockpiles of crude oil and distillates, which include heating
oil and diesel fuel, also fell last week.

Crude oil stockpiles fell 500,000 barrels, compared with a
forecast for a 760,000-barrel drop. Distillates, which include
heating oil and diesel, fell 200,000 barrels. Expectations had
been for a 780,000-barrel gain.

Refinery use rose 0.8 percentage point to 91 percent of capacity,

U.S. refinery outages in the lead up to the summer driving season
have been a major factor the past six months in crude oil's 45
percent gain from around US$50 a barrel.
</P>
<P>
U.S. gasoline demand in the four weeks ended July 13 was 9.626
million barrels a day, the Energy Information Agency's data show,
a gain of 1.3 percent from a year ago and the highest on record
for any four-week period. Demand the past week was 9.71 million
barrels a day, the second-highest ever and just 11,000 barrels a
day below the record weekly level set July 1, 2005.
