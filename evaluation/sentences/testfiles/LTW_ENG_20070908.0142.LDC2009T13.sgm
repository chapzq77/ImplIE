The day before Hurricane Katrina made landfall, Sal and Mabel
Mangano waffled, then decided against evacuating the mom-and-pop
nursing home they owned.
</P>
<P>
By morning, 35 of their frailest patients would be dead, drowned
in their wheelchairs and beds by the storm surge.
</P>
<P>
On Friday night, after four hours of deliberations, a jury
acquitted the Manganos of negligent homicide, charges that could
have put them in jail for life. The case raised broader questions
about who, if anyone, deserves to be punished for the deaths in
Katrina's deadly flooding.
</P>
<P>
While numerous government agencies have been faulted for the
disaster, the Manganos were the first and only people to be tried
in a criminal court for any of the countless mistakes of planning
that led to 1,800 deaths in the flooding that followed the storm
late in summer 2005.
</P>
<P>
After the verdict was read, Sal, 67, and Mabel, 64, hugged and
sobbed. The Manganos, who still face civil lawsuits in the
deaths, declined to comment on their acquittal.
</P>
<P>
"Thank you so very much," Mabel told a juror, and then the two
embraced.
</P>
<P>
"I went back and forth for sure, but when it came down to it, the
Manganos were not criminals," the juror, Kim Maxwell, 46, a
secretary at a power plant, said later. "I just wanted to hug
them."
</P>
<P>
Louisiana Attorney General Charles Foti Jr., who had pushed
forward with the controversial case, said in a statement: "I feel
for the victims of this tragedy. ... I hope they will be able to
find some peace."
</P>
<P>
Voluminous engineering studies, congressional hearings and a host
of other reports have put the blame for the Katrina deaths on
government officials.
</P>
<P>
The breachings and overtoppings in the flood defenses have been
blamed on the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Many people pointed
at the state and local governments -- and especially their
leaders, Louisiana Gov. Kathleen Babineaux Blanco and New Orleans
Mayor C. Ray Nagin, both Democrats -- for the chaotic evacuation
effort, which left behind many of the poor and infirm. And the
Federal Emergency Management Agency, FEMA Director Michael Brown
and President Bush were castigated for slow rescue and relief
efforts.
</P>
<P>
But of all the potential villains, only Sal and Mabel Mangano
have been tried on criminal charges.
</P>
<P>
"Sal and Mabel are the only two people on the planet charged with
anything," defense attorney James Cobb noted in closing
arguments.
</P>
<P>
The day before Katrina made landfall, Mabel Mangano, the
administrator of the nursing home, was getting worried calls from
relatives of her elderly residents: Shouldn't you evacuate? they
asked. Mangano and staff members said an evacuation would be done
"if necessary," and in preparation she called a nursing home in
Baton Rouge, out of harm's way, to inquire about available beds.
</P>
<P>
But at some point, the Manganos aborted their evacuation efforts.
Maybe it was because they feared the potentially lethal dangers
of transporting their frail clientele, or maybe they were trying
to avoid the expense -- they have never explained why publicly,
and did not testify in their own defense.
</P>
<P>
On the day before Katrina, the Manganos, having stocked up on
food, generators and medications, hunkered down at the nursing
home in St. Bernard Parish with their son, his wife, the staff, a
few of their children and 59 elderly clients.
</P>
<P>
When the levees broke the next morning, the home filled with
water up to the ceiling in about 20 minutes. The Manganos and
their staff scrambled to put their feeble clients onto plastic-
wrapped mattresses, which floated. Those who made it were brought
to the roof of the home, then ferried to a parish courthouse.
</P>
<P>
During the trial, prosecutors had suggested that the Manganos
were too cheap to evacuate their residents, amounting to a
"reckless disregard" for their patients' safety.
</P>
<P>
Noting that three other nursing homes in St. Bernard Parish did
evacuate, the prosecutors argued that the Manganos decided to
gamble with people's lives.
</P>
<P>
"They stuck their heads in the sand, tails in the air and hoped
that Mother Nature wouldn't kick them in the butt," Assistant
Attorney General Paul Knight told jurors in closing arguments.
</P>
<P>
The evidence that financial concerns drove their decision,
however, was relatively scant: A witness testified that after a
hurricane-preparedness meeting several years ago, Mabel Mangano
told her, "Unless the hurricane is coming in my back door, I'm
not putting my residents through an evacuation and wasting
money."
</P>
<P>
The defense attorneys argued that the Manganos chose to "shelter
in place" because they cared about their residents and feared the
potentially lethal dangers of transporting their frail clientele.
</P>
<P>
In their first vote Friday afternoon, jurors voted 5 to 1 for
acquittal.
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't just any one reason," juror Michael Cavalier said
afterward. "There were a lot of reasons why."
</P>
<P>
By all accounts, the Manganos' nursing home offered good care to
its residents before the storm.
</P>
<P>
Mabel, the administrator, sometimes helped bathe and dress the
residents; Sal, in charge of maintenance, stopped to spoon-feed
those who could not feed themselves. Their son and daughter-in-
law helped out.
</P>
<P>
Having been through Hurricane Betsy in 1965, the Manganos also
believed that their nursing home had been built on a high spot
and was less vulnerable to flooding.
</P>
<P>
The Manganos' fears for residents' safety during an evacuation
were well-founded, too, according to expert witnesses who
testified that nursing homes often suffer fatalities when
evacuated.
</P>
<P>
The trial has been fraught with tears and bitterness, and the
relatives of the dead and the Manganos have relived the tragedy.
</P>
<P>
"They killed 35 people," Joy Lewis, whose mother died in the
flooding, said after closing arguments. She added that while she
doesn't necessarily think the Manganos should go to jail, "they
should pay" and the specific form would be up to God. "When they
put their heads on their pillow at night," she said, "they'll
pay."
