Indonesia rediscovers its own rock legend
</HEADLINE>

JAKARTA, Indonesia 2008-08-03 00:12:42 UTC
</P>
<P>
It took a half century and YouTube to bring Indonesia's rock 'n'
roll legends back home.
</P>
<P>
Andy Tielman and his three brothers left for Europe in 1957,
where they packed clubs and stadiums with their high-energy
shows, tossing guitars across the stage, plucking strings with
their teeth and playing while perched on top of the standing
bass.
</P>
<P>
But while some music critics say the Tielman Brothers' rapid-fire
Les Paul riffs and rough interpretations of country-western
helped shape the sound of a generation, most fans in their native
Indonesia only learned about them this year.
</P>
<P>
A story in the local version of Rolling Stone magazine sent
curious readers to YouTube, where they could hardly believe their
eyes: "Insane !!!!!" a new fan wrote on one site. And "why did I
never hear of these guys?"
</P>
<P>
When Andy, now 72, returned to Indonesia for the first time to
perform this month, hundreds turned out to twist the night away,
calling out for old headliners written before most of them were
born and snapping pictures with their mobile phones.
</P>
<P>
"Magnificent! Fabulous! He TOTALLY rocks!" gushed Nada Yangrifqi,
a 22-year-old college student, after watching Tielman play
alongside an Indonesian band. "I'm so proud!"
</P>
<P>
Andy, Reggy, Ponthon and Loulou Tielman were born to a Dutch-
Indonesian father and German-Arab mother on the eastern island of
Sulawesi during the final years of Holland's centuries-long
colonial rule.
</P>
<P>
The boys, then 9 to 14, started out playing before family and
friends. Before long, they were going city-to-city with their
banjos, drums, guitars and bass, playing mostly folk songs. Often
their little sister, Jane, joined them on stage dancing.
</P>
<P>
"These were the happiest moments in my life," Andy, one of two
surviving brothers, said at an emotional post-gig press
conference in Jakarta, the Indonesian capital. "It was fun when
we were older, too, of course. But when I was a child, with my
brothers, that was really something."
</P>
<P>
Soon after Indonesia formally became independent in 1949, the
country's first president, the fiery Sukarno, condemned rock 'n'
roll as a symptom of Western decadence. The Tielmans reluctantly
left for Holland, settling in the small, southern city of Breda.
</P>
<P>
Though already falling under the influence of Elvis Presley,
Chuck Berry, Bill Haley and others, Andy said he and his brothers
knew they had to be more than imitators and created a sound and
style that came to be known as Indo Rock by some -- by others,
pure R&amp;R.
</P>
<P>
"We started playing country-western but my brother Loulou, who
played the drums, complained because there nothing for him to
do," he said, pounding the table as he belted out "Hey Good
Lookin'." "See? Load drums to that and you get rock and roll."
</P>
<P>
Andy, the band's lead guitarist and singer, introduced many
changes of his own.
</P>
<P>
He decided his Gibson was too heavy for stage throwing and
switched to a lighter Olympic White Jazzmaster, which he
converted from six to 10 strings, using a hot nail to drill extra
holes into the headstock. He added four much-thinner banjo
strings, creating a sought-after tighter, deeper sound that many
others later mimicked.
</P>
<P>
The boys went to Brussels and soon after Germany, where they
became an overnight sensation, selling out concert halls and
appearing on live TV. Next came Israel, where they became among
the first musicians ever to perform in a football stadium, a
45,000-seater.
</P>
<P>
Asked if the Tielman Brothers left their mark on the Beatles and
the Rolling Stones, as his fans so often claim, Andy said: "I
know John Lennon, then playing backup for the Tony Sheridan band,
saw us perform, a lot of the British did. But I'd never dare say
we influenced them."
</P>
<P>
The rocker returned to Indonesia at the invitation of the Jakarta
Rock Parade organizers -- a 100-band, three-day extravaganza that
wrapped up July 13.
</P>
<P>
Dressed in black with colored spotlights setting his long gray
hair ablaze, he played "Rock Little Baby of Mine," which in
January was officially recognized as Holland's first-ever rock 'n
roll song (1958). That accolade got the Tielman Brothers their
first press coverage in Indonesia -- the article in Rolling
Stone.
</P>
<P>
He went on to play "Little Bird," "Rollin' Rock" and "Beethoven
Rock," as well as the classics of others: "Blue Suede Shoes,"
"One Night," and "Oh My Love, My Darling." But there was no
strumming the guitar over his head or with his toes -- things he
said were better left to the young.
</P>
<P>
When Andy finally got around to his last song, a national
favorite, "Rajuan Pulau Kelapa" or "Coconut Tree Serenade," it
was well past 1 a.m. But neither he nor his audience wanted to
see the night end, swaying gently as they sang together, their
hands raised to the sky.
</P>
<P>
For Andy it was an emotional return. He said he felt honored to
be invited back for his music -- something he never dreamed would
happen -- and hoped to find a way to return soon.
</P>
<P>
"I feel I'm at home," he said, accompanied by his wife and 12
-year-old daughter. His only remaining sibling, Reggy, is 75 and
no longer able to perform.
</P>
<P>
"My only regret," he said, "is that my brothers couldn't be here
with me."
