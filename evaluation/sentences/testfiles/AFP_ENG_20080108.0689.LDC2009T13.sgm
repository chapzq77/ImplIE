Cricket: Australian press lash 'ugly' cricketers
</HEADLINE>

Australian media turned on the nation's world champion cricketers
over a bitter dispute with India Tuesday, branding their
behaviour "boorish" and "arrogant", with one newspaper demanding
captain Ricky Ponting be axed.
</P>
<P>
Sydney's Daily Telegraph said the crisis that had engulfed the
game since Australia's ill-tempered second Test victory over
India here on Sunday was the worst since the infamous Bodyline
series against England in 1932-33.
</P>
<P>
The row erupted after Indian spinner Harbhajan Singh received a
three-match suspension for allegedly calling Australia's only
black player Andrew Symonds a "monkey" and the Indians accused
the host nation of not playing in the spirit of the game.
</P>
<P>
"The arrogant Ponting must be sacked," ran the front page
headline in the Sydney Morning Herald, while the banner heading
The Australian newspaper's feature page screamed "Ugly
Australians".
</P>
<P>
With India delaying the next stage of its tour Down Under over
spinner Singh's suspension for racism, the media turned the
spotlight on the Australian behaviour that has left the tourists
seething.
</P>
<P>
"It has become apparent in recent years that the attitude and
behaviour of Australian players worsens the moment their
superiority is seriously challenged," The Australian's Mike
Coward wrote.
</P>
<P>
He said the Australian cricketers regarded themselves as hard-
nosed and aggressive but failed to understand that many in their
own country and beyond found their antics "boorish, arrogant and
ungracious".
</P>
<P>
The Sydney Morning Herald's Peter Roebuck singled out Ponting as
the main culprit, saying he should be sacked because he was so
intent on victory that he allowed his team to behave in a way
that embarrassed Australia.
</P>
<P>
"He turned a group of professional cricketers into a pack of wild
dogs," Roebuck wrote, citing the failure by some players to walk
when clearly out, the sledging aimed at the Indians and
Australia's strutting victory celebrations.
