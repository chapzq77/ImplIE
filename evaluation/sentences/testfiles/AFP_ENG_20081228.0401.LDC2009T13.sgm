Storm clouds gather for world economy in 2009
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If you thought 2008 was bad for the world economy, just wait for
2009. After a year when leading economies slid into recession,
the forecasts paint an even grimmer picture for the 12 months
ahead.
</P>
<P>
The slowdown in global demand will mean more job cuts, factory
closures and bankruptcies, as well as budget-stretching rescue
plans and government bailouts running into the hundreds of
billions of dollars (euros), economists said.
</P>
<P>
"We see 2009 as really being a bad year, with recession for most
advanced economies and growth decreasing for emerging economies,"
the head of the International Monetary Fund, Dominique Strauss-
Kahn, said earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
The IMF's chief economist, Olivier Blanchard, urged world
governments to spend more in order to boost domestic demand "if
we want to prevent this recession developing into a Great
Depression" like the downturn of the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
In the past 12 months, the OPEC oil cartel has implemented record
cuts in production amid plummeting demand, stock markets have
plunged and the world financial and auto sectors have been
reshaped by state intervention.
</P>
<P>
The Institute of International Finance, a Washington-based
association of 375 leading world banks and financial
institutions, has predicted a contraction for the world economy
in 2009 for the first time since at least the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
The IIF said the global economy will shrink 0.4 percent in 2009
after 2.0 percent growth this year, with IIF managing director
Charles Dallara calling it "the most severe, globally
synchronized recession in modern economic history."
</P>
<P>
A report on Friday by the Centre for Economic and Business
Research in London forecast contraction of 2.9 percent for the
British economy over 2009 -- the worst full-year growth figure
for Britain since the end of World War II.
</P>
<P>
It was just the latest in a relentless round of depressing 2009
forecasts.
</P>
<P>
The world's biggest economy, the United States, will shrink by
0.9 percent, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and
Development said this month despite hopes that US president-elect
Barack Obama will help stimulate growth.
</P>
<P>
Obama has promised a "bold" stimulus plan of vast public works to
pull the US economy out of recession after he takes office on
January 20, drawing parallels to the 1930s New Deal that helped
end the Great Depression.
</P>
<P>
Germany's Ifo economic institute said Europe's largest economy
will contract by 2.2 percent and the Japanese government has
forecast zero growth for 2009 as Japan's export-oriented economy
takes a hard hit from the slump in demand.
</P>
<P>
"We need to take unprecedented measures when in an extraordinary
economic situation," Japanese Prime Minister Taro Aso said this
week soon after his cabinet approved a record-high budget aimed
at stimulating the ailing economy.
</P>
<P>
While all the growth forecasts remain positive for the world's
leading developing economies -- Brazil, Russia, India and China
-- these recently booming giants have also been hit hard by the
decline in global demand.
</P>
<P>
The Russian government is forecasting a budget deficit for 2009
for the first time since the chaotic 1998 financial crisis and
wage arrears and layoffs have prompted Russian officials to warn
about the prospect of popular unrest.
</P>
<P>
In a rare admission of trouble ahead, China's top economic
planner, Zhang Ping, said this month: "We are confronted with
great challenges resulting from a dramatic change in the world
economic and financial situation."
</P>
<P>
In Iceland and Ukraine, the two European countries worst hit by
the economic and financial crisis, 2008 has seen street protests
and bank closures.
</P>
<P>
Both countries are predicting their economies will shrink
massively in 2009 despite getting IMF loans, with Iceland
forecasting a contraction of 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
"We are protesting against the arbitrariness of the government,"
said Irina Kulich, 46, in a crowd in Kiev this month as
protesters held placards reading: "No to the Impoverishment of
the People!" and "Patience is not Unlimited!"
