<P>
One of Denmark's national treasures, a set of two horns made in
the 1800s, was recovered by police Tuesday after being stolen in
the early hours of Monday, local television station TV2Syd
reported.
</P>
<P>
Police inspector Steen Edeling told the station in the central
town of Vejle that the horns had been found. He did not give any
details, but a press conference was to be held in Vejle at 0800
GMT Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Called "Guldhornene" in Danish, or the Golden Horns, the pieces
are silver replicas of two original gold horns made in 400 AD
which were stolen in 1802 and destroyed.
</P>
<P>
The replicas, with a thin gold coating, were on loan from the
National Museum of Denmark for an exhibit in Jelling, near the
central Danish town of Vejle, when they were stolen by thieves
who smashed a display case.
</P>
<P>
Even though the works are replicas they are part of the country's
cultural heritage, National Museum curator Carsten Larsen said.
</P>
<P>
The originals were discovered in the town of Gallehus in southern
Denmark in 1639 before they went missing and were found again in
1734.
</P>
<P>
They were stolen in 1802 from the Royal Chamber of Art by an
indebted jeweller, Niels Heidenreich, who melted the gold to make
jewellery and counterfeit coins.
</P>
<P>
The horns are a national symbol known to all and have even
inspired a famous poem penned by Danish writer Adam
Oehenschlaeger.
