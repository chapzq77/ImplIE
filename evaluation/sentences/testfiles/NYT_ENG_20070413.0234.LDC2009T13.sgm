BANKER GATHERS HIS DEFENDERS, BUT THERE AREN'T MANY

WASHINGTON
</P>
<P>
Paul D. Wolfowitz, the embattled president of the World Bank,
worked behind the scenes on Friday to gain the support of finance
and development ministers from around the world, but there were
few endorsements of his leadership outside the Bush
administration.
</P>
<P>
"We must just allow the process to work through," said Trevor
Manuel, the finance minister of South Africa, referring to the
bank board's announcement on Friday that it would continue to
weigh Wolfowitz's role in the transfer and pay raise of his
companion after he became president of the bank in 2005.
</P>
<P>
Manuel also said the bank must avoid a rush to judgment. But
Manuel is close to Wolfowitz, and the failure to praise him was
significant. Wolfowitz visited South Africa this year and has
called Manuel one of Africa's most talented leaders.
</P>
<P>
In Paris, a Foreign Ministry spokesman was similarly tepid and
noncommittal, noting that the bank's board had a process under
way. He said France would make its own views known when
appropriate.
</P>
<P>
Throughout the day, Bush administration officials praised
Wolfowitz's leadership, but at an evening news conference,
Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. said that because the
bank board was still considering the matter, he would not comment
on what he thought the outcome should be.
</P>
<P>
"This should not be read as any lessening of the United States'
support for Paul Wolfowitz," he said. Asked specifically if he
would call for Wolfowitz to remain as head of the World Bank, he
responded, "I said what I said."
</P>
<P>
The disclosure on Thursday of Wolfowitz's involvement in the
raise given to his companion, Shaha Ali Riza, has stirred a furor
within the bank and prompted demands from its staff association
that he step down. Board members are said to be considering
whether to reprimand him or encourage him to resign.
</P>
<P>
Bank officials familiar with the thinking of some of the 24
members of the board, who represent countries or groups of
countries, said they were uncertain how to proceed and would be
consulting this weekend with finance ministers here for meetings
of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
The bank leadership was also looking for a signal from the United
States, including an indication as to whether President Bush
would insist that Wolfowitz had done nothing wrong, or whether
some in the administration might encourage him to resign from an
institution that is in a virtual uprising against his leadership.
</P>
<P>
"He could decide that his relationship with the staff and the
board is so soured that he doesn't have the trust he needs to go
forward," one administration official said, adding that he saw no
evidence the White House was pushing for that.
</P>
<P>
Early Friday morning, after meeting the previous evening, the
bank's board released a sheaf of documents about Wolfowitz's
decision to direct the bank's vice president for human resources
to reassign Riza to the State Department with a promotion, a
raise and guarantees of future raises and promotions.
</P>
<P>
The staff association has charged that several of Wolfowitz's
actions violated normal bank rules.
</P>
<P>
The board issued a statement saying that Wolfowitz did not
involve the ethics and legal counsel in many of the decisions
relating to the transfer, contrary to earlier suggestions by
Wolfowitz. But it did not conclude that he had deliberately
flouted the rules.
</P>
<P>
The 7,000 employees of the World Bank in Washington have been
exchanging e-mail messages and comments, many of them critical of
Wolfowitz but some expressing sympathy with his situation and his
dealings with Riza, who had been a bank officer for seven years
when he became president in 2005.
</P>
<P>
Supporters and critics of Wolfowitz seized on the documents as
evidence for the two different points of view.
</P>
<P>
On one hand, the documents made it clear that Wolfowitz was very
much involved in the decision to give Riza a raise to more than
$190,000 a year, with the aim of compensating her for the
disruption of the transfer, but critics said he violated his own
preaching to the bank about the need for transparency and
integrity.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Wolfowitz's defenders noted that the documents
showed he had tried to recuse himself from involvement in
personnel decisions affecting Riza when he arrived at the bank,
and reluctantly became involved in her transfer only after the
head of ethics for the board directed him to do so.
</P>
<P>
Wolfowitz remained out of public view on Friday, as did Riza, a
British citizen who was born in Libya. But the board's documents
provided a glimpse into the emotions of both as they struggled to
reconcile their professional and personal lives.
</P>
<P>
In his first month at the bank, Wolfowitz appeared from the
documents to have been almost preoccupied by the matter. He had
at first tried to allow Riza to stay at the bank and even to deal
with her professionally there, with the promise to recuse himself
if conflicts arose. That wish was denied by the ethics staff.
</P>
<P>
With some irritation, Wolfowitz wrote a note in August 2005
saying the ethics committee had "explicitly directed me to
resolve the matter by providing instruction" to a vice president
for human resources. Later, he sent that vice president a
directive that Riza be given promotions and pay raises. The
documents show that the officials involved in making arrangements
for the transfer to the State Department included J. Scott
Carpenter, a deputy assistant secretary of state.
</P>
<P>
Riza displayed even more displeasure in a letter written to the
board this month from her position as an adviser to a semi-
independent foundation that promotes democracy. She said she felt
"victimized for agreeing to an arrangement that I have objected
to, and that I did not believe from the outset was in my best
interest."
