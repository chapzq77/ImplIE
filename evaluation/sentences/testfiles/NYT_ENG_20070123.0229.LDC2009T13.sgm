NYMEX ABANDONING PLANS FOR BRITISH TRADING FLOOR
</HEADLINE>

LONDON
</P>
<P>
Nymex Holdings, parent company of the New York Mercantile
Exchange and a lonely champion of open-outcry trading, is cutting
its last ties to an ill-fated plan to set up a trading floor in
Britain.
</P>
<P>
The commodities market has quietly applied for "derecognition of
exchange" with British regulators, traders here in London said.
Markets that trade in London are required to certify to the main
regulator, the Financial Services Authority of Britain, that they
are "recognized investment exchanges."
</P>
<P>
With the request for "derecognition," Nymex's presence in London
reverts to a marketing office, a far cry from the ambitious
expansion plans it undertook less than two years ago.
</P>
<P>
"We've had to adjust our business model," a Nymex spokeswoman,
Anu Ahluwalia, said Tuesday, confirming the application. "We were
very ambitious and went in and built a trading floor, and that is
not the way that business is going, so we adapted very quickly."
</P>
<P>
Since Nymex went public last November, investors and analysts
have wondered how the company might expand internationally and
take advantage of the worldwide boom in commodities. Nymex's
British foray could provide a good road map of the wrong way to
do so.
</P>
<P>
The movement across the Atlantic started after the International
Petroleum Exchange in London went fully electronic in April 2005,
following 25 years of open-outcry trading. That market is part of
the IntercontinentalExchange, or ICE, Nymex's big rival. The New
York exchange had already tested an open-outcry exchange in
Dublin, which it opened in 2004.
</P>
<P>
But Nymex was not able to move quickly, and it took five months
to get the trading floor up and running, a result in part of
regulatory snarls. Nymex spent millions trying to encourage
traders to use its London floor, and on the first day of trading,
in September 2005, 12 companies and 76 traders showed up. Nymex
was expected to start open-pit exchanges in Dubai, Singapore and
possibly Tokyo or Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
But the British initiative proved short-lived, and appears to
have discouraged plans for open pits elsewhere. By March 2006,
Nymex in London was trading fewer than 20 contracts a day for
Brent crude futures, the most common oil contract here, compared
with about 200,000 on ICE Futures.
</P>
<P>
Executives at other exchanges and commodity traders said that
Nymex's five-month delay in opening gave the International
Petroleum Exchange time to learn how to trade electronically, or
time to drift into another business. The IPE's electronic
exchange was also faster than some critics expected.
</P>
<P>
Nymex's foray also inspired ICE to start trading an important
Nymex product, West Texas intermediate crude oil. By June 2006,
Nymex had closed its London open-outcry floor and transferred
trading of European commodity contracts onto an electronic and an
over-the-counter exchange.
</P>
<P>
Open outcry in London "never took off the way that we hoped,"
Ahluwalia said. "This is by no means an end to our global
growth."
</P>
<P>
Nymex Holdings also includes the Comex metals market in New York.
It has offices in Singapore and Tokyo, and is working with the
Dubai government to open a mercantile exchange there, which will
be electronic. "We're going to expand our brand globally,"
Ahluwalia said, "just not through a trading floor."
</P>
<P>
Though Nymex failed in London, some open-outcry exchanges still
exist here. The London Metal Exchange does the bulk of its
trading by open outcry, and had record volume in 2006.
</P>
<P>
Open outcry "is still the most efficient and most popular method
of trading," a spokesman for the London Metal Exchange, Adam
Robinson, said.
