<P>
Ruling Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Wu Poh-hsiung and his KMT
delegation departed for Japan Sunday for a week-long visit aimed
at cementing bilateral relations with Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
It marked the first time the KMT chairman has headed to Japan to
promote party- to-party exchanges since the KMT came to power in
May.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, Wu and his team are expected to meet with
leaders of major political parties in Japan and several senior
politicians who have assumed important government positions.
</P>
<P>
Noting that President Ma Ying-jeou is attaching great importance
to the trip, Wu told the media prior to his departure that the
president asked him to pass on some messages to the Japanese
side.
</P>
<P>
One of them, Wu said, was that in view of the "special
partnership" Taiwan and Japan have maintained, the two sides
should spare no effort to further bolster bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan and Japan are very close to each other geographically,
share many common interests and have deep historical links, with
bilateral trade amounting to US$60 billion and more than 2.5
million visitors traveling between the countries per year, Wu
quoted Ma as saying the day before.
</P>
<P>
Wu said that although Taiwan cannot relinquish its sovereignty
claim over the disputed Tiaoyutais, a group of islets in the East
China Sea claimed by both sides along with China, the president
believes that Taiwan and Japan "can put aside the dispute and
move toward pursuing their common interests, like fishery
cooperation."
</P>
<P>
Wu said Japan may suffer some losses as a transportation hub
after direct air and shipping links between Taiwan and China are
developed, but that overall Japan will continue to benefit from
closer Taiwan-China exchanges.
</P>
<P>
For example, he said, a great number of Taiwanese enterprises
have purchased machinery and production equipment from Japan and
then exported their products to China, allowing both Taiwan and
Japan to prosper from the triangular relationship.
</P>
<P>
"Taiwan and Japan can work together to crack China's vast
market," he said.
</P>
<P>
One of the key members of Wu's delegation is former Taiwan
representative in Japan Hsu Shui-teh. Wu said Hsu will contribute
a lot to the visit because he has maintained close connections
with Japanese politicians  and has clout in bilateral  Taiwan-
Japan relations.
