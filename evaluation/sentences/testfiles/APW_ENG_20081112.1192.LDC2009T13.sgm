Congo rebels make roadblock out of bodies
</HEADLINE>

KILIMANYOKA, Congo 2008-11-12 19:24:42 UTC
</P>
<P>
The road that leads into rebel-controlled Congo begins with a
makeshift roadblock made from the corpses of two government
soldiers strewn across the dark volcanic earth.
</P>
<P>
The pair on Wednesday blocked the main two-lane track running
north from the regional capital, Goma -- one with a bullet in his
forehead and a frozen fist grasping the air above.
</P>
<P>
The scene was meant as a warning to government troops just a few
hundred yards down the road whom the rebels had battled the night
before. And for the few fearful civilians trickling past the
frontline, it was clear message that Congo's savage war is not
easing amid fears it could draw in Angola and others in the
region.
</P>
<P>
"We don't want any more of it," said 18-year-old John Biamungu,
who pushed a wooden bicycle past the corpse-strewn checkpoint as
rebels stood in a clutch of trees on both sides staring silently.
</P>
<P>
Years of sporadic violence in eastern Congo intensified in
August, and fighting between the army and fighters loyal to rebel
leader Laurent Nkunda has displaced at least 250,000 people since
then -- despite the presence of the largest U.N. peacekeeping
force in the world.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Angola's Deputy Foreign Minister Georges Chicoty
said Angola was mobilizing troops to send to Congo; if confirmed
it would add to fears the conflict could engulf the region.
</P>
<P>
It was not clear whether the soldiers would be intended to serve
a peacekeeping role or back Congolese troops, as they did during
a ruinous 1998-2002 war that drew in more than half a dozen
African nations.
</P>
<P>
Associated Press reporters have already seen Portuguese-speaking
soldiers wearing green berets with pins in the shape of Angola
appearing to guard a road alongside Congolese soldiers. But
Angola has denied their presence.
</P>
<P>
The overt entry of Angolans into the conflict could draw in
Rwanda, which Congo has already accused of sending troops to
support Nkunda.
</P>
<P>
Rwanda battled highly trained Angolan troops during the 1998-2002
war, which tore Congo into rival fiefdoms. Rebels backed by
Uganda and Rwanda seized vast swaths of territory rich in coffee,
gold and tin in the east, while Angola and Zimbabwe, sent tanks
and fighter planes to back Congo's government in exchange for
access to lucrative diamond and copper mines to the south and
west.
</P>
<P>
Eastern Congo has been unstable since millions of refugees
spilled across the border from Rwanda's 1994 genocide, which saw
more than 500,000 ethnic Tutsis and moderate Hutus slaughtered.
</P>
<P>
Many of the Hutu extremists who orchestrated the mass killings
have remained in Congo, prompting Tutsi-led Rwanda to invade the
mineral-rich nation twice. Nkunda, who quit Congo's army in 2004,
has taken up the cause. He claims he is fighting to protect
Tutsis, who like Hutus are a minority and one of an estimated 200
ethnic groups in Congo.
</P>
<P>
The bodies blocking the maroon-tinged road at Kilimanyoka
Wednesday were dressed in olive green military uniforms. Each
wore the blue armbands of the army. Both were barefoot, their
boots apparently removed by rebels.
</P>
<P>
A white four-wheel drive belonging to a humanitarian aid group
slowed down and wound off the road around them. Civilians covered
their mouths as they passed in silence, aghast at the scene.
Rebels standing in trees on both sides of the road stared coldly
at approaching journalists and the few civilians who passed by.
</P>
<P>
Asked how the army troops came to be placed in the road, one
rebel wearing an olive green poncho grinned.
</P>
<P>
"The army attacked," he said, looking out at the bodies and a
light rain drizzled from a dark sky. "This is what happens when
the army attacks."
</P>
<P>
He refused to give his name because his commander was not
present.
</P>
<P>
After walking a few hundred yards south through an empty no-mans
land that separates the two sides, Biamungu stopped and spoke to
a reporter.
</P>
<P>
"The rebels said to us, 'What are you looking at?' Biamungu
recounted. "We didn't say anything. We kept moving. Honestly, we
are afraid."
</P>
<P>
Exhausted Congolese soldiers sat leisurely by the road,
apparently unworried rebels were so close. It was a bizarre mix,
neither war nor peace.
</P>
<P>
"When we get orders to attack, we will," said Congolese army
Capt. Alex Kazadi, as a couple soldiers cooked stews in the
fields behind him, the steam from boiling water evaporating into
the chilly air. "This has gone on too long."
</P>
<P>
The rebels, however, are far more disciplined on the battlefield
than Congo's ill-trained army, which was forced into a
humiliating retreat in late October as Nkunda's forces advanced
toward Goma and suddenly halted.
</P>
<P>
Both sides blamed each other for starting Tuesday's clash.
</P>
<P>
Asked if he had lost any troops in the gunbattle, Kazadi
shrugged. "It's normal to lose men in a war," he said.
</P>
<P>
A few miles (kilometers) to the south at Kibati, thousands of
people lined up to get survival kits being handed out from five
white International Committee of the Red Cross trucks. The kits
contained buckets, blankets, soap, hoes and cooking utensils,
said Abdallah Togola, an ICRC official in Kibati.
</P>
<P>
Togola said the area was reaching its capacity to handle
refugees.
</P>
<P>
"All the schools and churches are full," he said, adding that
local families have taken in about six people each.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's fighting, which lasted nearly an hour, sent some
families rushing for what they hoped was the safety of refugee
camps. Others ran into the bush.
</P>
<P>
Biamungu said he'd slept with his mother and two siblings in the
open under a banana field, fearing the camp could be targeted. It
wasn't.
</P>
<P>
Many are to afraid to return to villages to the north seized by
rebels in the last few weeks. Biamungu said he fled the village
of Rugari months earlier. He risked going back Wednesday to bring
back a sack of sweet potatoes and illegal charcoal he hoped to
sell in Kibati for $10.
</P>
<P>
U.N. peacekeeping spokesman Col. Jean-Paul Dietrich urged both
sides to show restraint.
</P>
<P>
"It's not acceptable that in the proximity of 75,000 people (in
Kibati), they cannot cease hostilities for a few days," Dietrich
said. "We are working hard to separate them. They have to be
responsible actors."
