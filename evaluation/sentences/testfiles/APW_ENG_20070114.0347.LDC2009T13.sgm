US negotiator calls for ' good agreement '  with South Korea on
free trade

The chief U.S. negotiator in free trade talks with South Korea
said Sunday that the two sides need to make progress this week
toward achieving an agreement.
</P>
<P>
Assistant U.S. Trade Representative Wendy Cutler told reporters
upon arrival that the sixth round of negotiations, set to begin
Monday in Seoul, are important. The key objective, she said, is
"to get an agreement, a good agreement." She said she was
"looking forward to a productive week."
</P>
<P>
Since launching the talks in June, Seoul and Washington have so
far reported little progress toward a deal that, if completed,
would be the biggest for the U.S. since the North American Free
Trade Agreement of 1993.
</P>
<P>
The latest round in the United States last month failed to bridge
numerous gaps, including Seoul's request for Washington to change
its antidumping laws and patent protections for American
pharmaceutical companies. Other thorny issues include autos and
agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Cutler and South Korean counterpart will be in overtime, having
missed their initial, albeit informal, goal of wrapping up a
basic deal by the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President George W. Bush's ability to "fast track" an
agreement through Congress -- meaning he can submit it for a
straight yes-or-no vote without amendments -- expires on July 1.
</P>
<P>
But any agreement would have to go to Washington at least 90 days
before that because lawmakers would need to review the agreement
before a vote. The deal also requires approval by South Korean
lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
An agreement would slash tariffs and other barriers on a wide
range of goods and services from the two nations, which already
do US$72 billion (euro56 billion) worth of business a year. South
Korea, the world's 10th-largest economy, is already the U.S.'s
seventh-biggest trading partner.
