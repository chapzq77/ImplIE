Security Comes at a Price for Poles

PROCHNIK, Poland
</P>
<P>
One grave stands out in the tiny, unfenced village cemetery.
Andrzej Zielke's plot is the only one enclosed by an ironwork
fence and the only one with a small bench that sits in front of
flickering candles and the black, broken heart of a headstone.
</P>
<P>
``He died tragically executing a fighting order in the second
change of the Polish military contingent in Iraq,'' reads the
inscription, in Polish, on the broken heart, which is etched with
the young soldier's face.
</P>
<P>
Zielke's black army beret, soaked recently by a winter rain, sits
next to the headstone.
</P>
<P>
About 400 yards down the only road in the village of Prochnik is
a farmhouse -- home to a gentle-voiced Polish woman who lost her
beloved son in a desert far away and who can't figure out why he
was in Iraq, fighting an American war.
</P>
<P>
``I have no idea,'' said Stanislawa Zielke, 49, when asked why
she thought Poland had sent its troops -- the third largest Iraq
coalition force after the United States and Britain.
</P>
<P>
Many Poles wonder why their government seems so keen to help out
the United States in its wars at a time when many other countries
are distancing themselves from Iraq and, to a lesser extent,
Afghanistan. Al-Qaida did not attack Poland, people say -- though
perhaps now it will, they quip. Saddam Hussein, even if he had
possessed weapons of mass destruction, was not likely to have put
Warsaw near the top of his target list.
</P>
<P>
Polls regularly show at least 70 percent of Poles disapprove of
their roughly 1,000-strong contingent being in Iraq. But
successive Polish governments have continued a policy of
cooperation with the United States on military and intelligence
matters that is perhaps unmatched by any country other than
Britain.
</P>
<P>
Poland announced late last year that its troops will stay in Iraq
through this year and, privately, politicians expect levels to be
maintained for years. Poland also is upping its troop levels in
Afghanistan from about 100 to more than 1,000 at a time when it
is increasingly hard to find NATO volunteers for the ever-more
dangerous war there.
</P>
<P>
And, soon there will be up to 500 troops helping keep peace
between Israel and Hezbollah in southern Lebanon, a region the
U.S. cares very much about since Israel is the United States'
most important Middle East ally.
</P>
<P>
Add to the list of Polish favors to the United States the
forthcoming negotiations between the two governments over the
proposed location of an American missile defense system in Poland
that would help protect the United States but not Poland itself
and the CIA's widely reported use -- which Poland has officially
denied -- of a Polish air base for transporting terrorist
suspects to secret interrogation sites.
</P>
<P>
There is a simple calculation that explains this unfashionable
support of the U.S. and its military ventures, Polish
politicians, Western diplomats and analysts say: Surrounded by
historically hostile countries such as Russia and Germany and
abandoned in the face of Nazi invasion in 1939 by European allies
such as Britain, Poland looks across the Atlantic for bankable
friendship. A Russian invasion may seem unlikely now, experts
say, but Poles have learned -- through centuries of occupation
and vast suffering -- to be extremely wary of their neighbors.
</P>
<P>
``Insurance,'' said Konstanty Gebert, a leading Polish columnist
and author, using a single word to explain his country's strong
pro-U.S. foreign policy. ``This is not a country that feels it's
future is assured. Most of that is paranoia -- but not all.''
</P>
<P>
Other than its membership in NATO and the agreement of all member
states to help defend any state that is attacked, Poland has no
guarantees that its gentleman's agreement with the United States
will pay off.
</P>
<P>
``What they get for it is the security umbrella,'' said a Western
diplomat in Warsaw who requested anonymity. ``It keeps that
favorable impression of Poland in Washington high.''
</P>
<P>
There are signs of cooling toward the United States, however,
among Polish politicians. Marian Pilka, a leading member of
parliament in the ruling Law and Justice Party, told Newsday that
when the government sits down to negotiate the missile system
with the United States, it will expect something in return.
</P>
<P>
``If this system is to be in Poland, it will make some danger to
our country and should be balanced by our own missile defense
system,'' he said, referring to U.S.-made Patriot missile defense
systems, which could help protect Poland from attacks on its
territory.
</P>
<P>
But for those who have suffered from Poland's decision in 2003 to
join the war in Iraq, the idea of a theoretical American
insurance policy for their country seems irrelevant given the
cost.
</P>
<P>
``I'm mad at everybody who had anything to do with the war,''
Stanislawa Zielke said when asked if her son's death was a
sacrifice worth making for the sake of Poland's security.
</P>

As she stood in her kitchen sipping tea and playing with a
grandchild -- the daughter of another son -- her husband,
Krzysztof, opened the door and heard the conversation. He opened
a cupboard, pulled out a wrench and, leaving again, said: ``I
don't want to speak because I know I'll cry.''
</P>
<P>
His wife remembered one of her last conversations with Andrzej
before he left for Iraq. He told her: ``I just need to catch this
Osama guy and I'll be back.''
</P>
<P>

Andrzej, 26, was killed by Iraqi insurgents in June 2004, about a
month before his tour of duty was to end. He was hit by a rocket,
his body torn into pieces. He left a wife and two sons, one of
whom he never got to see.
</P>
<P>
To this day, his mother rushes to the television when news of
Iraq appears. She wants to see the country where she believes the
parts of her son that weren't scooped up and brought back to
Prochnik for burial still lie.
</P>
<P>
A few days after she spoke, Poland lost its 19th soldier in Iraq.
