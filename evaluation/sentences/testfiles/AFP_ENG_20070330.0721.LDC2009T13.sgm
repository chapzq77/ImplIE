Brazilian government, unions agree to end airport strike
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The Brazilian government and striking air traffic controllers
reached agreement late Friday about ending a strike that has
closed 49 of the nation's busiest airports, local television
reported.
</P>
<P>
Globo TV reported the deal was reached during an emergency
meeting between members of the Brazilian cabinet and unions
representing the controllers.
</P>
<P>
The government has agreed to suspend planned transfers of
striking workers from the airport of Brasilia, the capital, to
other parts of the country, increase worker salaries, and begin
talks about "demilitarizing" the industry.
</P>
<P>
The Brazilian military exercises significant control over traffic
in the country's airspace, and most air traffic controllers
technically work for it.
</P>
<P>
The negotiations took place while Brazilian President Luiz Inacio
Lula da Silva was out of the country, visiting the United States,
where he is scheduled to meet Saturday with President George W.
Bush.
</P>
<P>
But according to the report, Lula called top defense and airline
industry officials and urged them to step back from a
confrontation with the strikers.
