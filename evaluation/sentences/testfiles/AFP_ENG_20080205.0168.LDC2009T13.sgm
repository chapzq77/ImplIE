Zimbabwe's Mugabe to face polls challenge from ex-minister
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe's hopes of cruising to victory
at polls next month suffered a severe jolt Tuesday as his
respected former finance minister Simba Makoni announced his
candidacy.
</P>
<P>
Makoni, a member of the ruling Zimbabwe African National Union -
Patriotic Front (ZANU-PF) party, said he would take on Mugabe at
the ballot box as an independent in a move analysts said could
unite the president's opponents.
</P>
<P>
"Following very extensive and intensive consultations with party
members and activists countrywide and also with others outside
the party, I have accepted the call and hereby advise the people
of Zimbabwe that I offer myself as candidate for the office of
president," Makoni told a press conference.
</P>
<P>
"Let me confirm that I share the agony and anguish of all
citizens over the extreme hardships that we all have endured for
nearly 10 years now," added Makoni who was Mugabe's finance
minister from 2000-2003.
</P>
<P>
"I also share the widely held view that these hardships are a
result of failure of national leadership and that change at that
level is a pre-requisite for change at other levels of national
endeavour."
</P>
<P>
Mugabe, who has ruled the former British colony since
independence in 1980, is hoping to secure a sixth term in office
at joint parliamentary and presidential elections on March 29.
</P>
<P>
Since Makoni left office, Zimbabwe's economy has been in a
dramatic downward spiral and it now has an annual inflation rate
of more than 26,000 percent, the highest in the world.
Unemployment also stands at around 80 percent.
</P>
<P>
But despite the economic woes, the opposition has been in
disarray with the two factions of the Movement for Democratic
Change (MDC) party unable to agree on a candidate to take on the
soon-to-be 84 Mugabe.
</P>
<P>
Takavafira Zhou, an analyst at Zimbabwe's Masvingo State
University, said Makoni would present a stiff challenge,
especially if he could attract other disillusioned members of the
establishment.
</P>
<P>
"He will pose a real challenge to Mugabe. For the first time
Mugabe will have a hard time dealing with opposition from his own
ranks," said Zhou.
</P>
<P>
"The move by Makoni could mean the demise of Mugabe, particularly
if Makoni can get the support of the Mujurus and the army."
</P>
<P>
Vice President Joyce Mujuru and her husband Solomon Mujuru, a
former head of the armed forces, have previously been touted as
possible challengers to Mugabe but have been reluctant to break
ranks and their stance is seen as critical.
</P>
<P>
The 57-year-old Makoni said he had hoped to have stood as ZANU-
PF's official candidate but had been left with no alternative
after the party congress endorsed Mugabe at its conference in
December.
</P>
<P>
George Katito, a Zimbabwe analyst at the Johannesburg-based South
African Institute of International Affairs, said Makoni would
face formidable hurdles.
</P>
<P>
"His challenge will breathe new life (into the contest) but
whether it's a feasible platform is questionable considering the
very strong political machine that Mugabe has run," said Katito.
</P>
<P>
Katito however said Makoni could expect to win over voters who
were "disillusioned with the MDC" and saw him as a more credible
alternative.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe won the last presidential elections in 2002 in a contest
against the MDC's main leader Morgan Tsvangirai but the result
was disputed by Western governments which subsequently imposed a
package of sanctions.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Tsvangirai's faction welcomed the prospect of
Makoni running for president while refusing to say whether the
MDC would step aside.
</P>
<P>
"A weak and limping ZANU-PF is good news for the opposition and
this is most welcome," Nelson Chamisa told AFP.
</P>
<P>
The MDC splinter group led by Tsvangirai's rival Arthur Mutambara
also welcomed Makoni's announcement.
</P>
<P>
"We welcome anyone who is willing to fight poverty, hunger and
the dictatorship of Robert Mugabe's government," said Gabriel
Chaibva.
