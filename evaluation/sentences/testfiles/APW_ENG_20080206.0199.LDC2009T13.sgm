SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- BHP Billiton formalized its unwelcome
takeover bid for Rio Tinto on Wednesday and raised the stakes
with an all-share offer worth US$147.4 billion (euro100.35
billion) that would create a global mining monolith.
</P>
<P>
Rio Tinto, which rejected an initial approach from BHP Billiton
last year as too low, said it would consider the new offer, and
urged its shareholders not to act hastily.
</P>
<P>
BHP Billiton is offering 3.4 of its shares for every one Rio
Tinto share, an increase from the initial informal proposal of
three-for-one, the Melbourne-based company said. The offer
applies to both companies in the Rio Tinto Group, the Australian-
listed company Rio Tinto Ltd. and British-listed Rio Tinto PLC.
</P>
<P>
BHP Billiton is already the world's largest diversified mining
company, and Rio Tinto is the third-largest and analysts say that
if the deal succeeds it would be the biggest takeover in the
mining sector and one of the biggest ever in the corporate world.
</P>
<P>
Steelmakers in China, Japan and Europe have protested BHP
Billiton's bid for Rio Tinto, contending that a takeover would
give it too much influence over global iron ore supplies and
pricing.
</P>
<P>
The deal would be subject to regulatory approvals in Australia,
the United States, Europe and elsewhere, and to 50 percent
shareholder approval, BHP Billiton Chief Executive Officer Marius
Kloppers said.
</P>
<P>
He said the proposed merger would deliver efficiency benefits
worth US$3.7 billion (euro2.5 billion) a year and raise the value
of shareholdings in both companies.
</P>
<P>
"I believe there is widespread support for the compelling logic
of the proposal to combine the companies," Kloppers told a
briefing for reporters and analysts in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
Rio Tinto Chairman Paul Skinner said the company would carefully
consider BHP Billiton's latest offer, and asked shareholders not
to take any action yet.
</P>
<P>
"The boards of Rio Tinto will consider the terms of the proposal
carefully in the light of all circumstances and will make a
further statement once they have completed this assessment,"
Skinner said. "In the meantime, the boards encourage shareholders
not to take any action."
</P>
<P>
Rio Tinto's shares in Australia surged Wednesday, defying a broad
market plunge to rise more than 2 percent to 129.91 Australian
dollars. Shares in BHP Billiton -- which also Wednesday reported
a 2.4 percent drop in net profit on-year for the six months to
end-December -- fell almost 5 percent to A$37.79.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said BHP Billiton's new offer would be more attractive
to Rio Tinto than the earlier bid.
</P>
<P>
"It's a good starting point, it should get Rio to the negotiating
table," Rob Patterson, managing director of Argo Investments,
told Dow Jones Newswires.
</P>
<P>
In documents accompanying the announcement, BHP Billiton valued
its latest offer at US$147.4 billion (euro100.35 billion) using
its closing share prices on Monday. BHP Billiton also said that
based on its share prices as of Oct. 31 last year, the last
trading day before it first approached Rio Tinto, the deal would
be worth US$173.6 billion (euro118.19 billion).
</P>
<P>
The value of the all-share swap changes daily as the shares of
BHP Billiton trade in their separate listings on Sydney and
London.
</P>
<P>
BHP Billiton's approach to Rio Tinto was complicated last week
when Aluminum Corp. of China and Alcoa Inc. bought a 12 percent
stake in Rio Tinto's London-listed stock, which equated to a 9
percent stake in the whole group.
</P>
<P>
Kloppers said the development was interesting but did not affect
BHP Billiton's offer.
</P>
<P>
The purchase by Aluminum Corp. of China, known as Chinalco, and
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania-based Alcoa followed rumors that some
Chinese entity might try to block BHP Billiton's takeover bid for
Rio Tinto.
</P>
<P>
Chinalco President Xiao Yaqing said this week in Australia that
the stake it took in Rio Tinto reflected his company's confidence
in the global economic outlook and the ability of Rio Tinto's
management.
</P>
<P>
He suggested Chinalco might be prepared to sell its stake in Rio
Tinto as part of a BHP bid "if the return is attractive."
</P>
<P>
Chinalco and Alcoa have said they have no intention to raise
their stake in Rio Tinto, though they reserved the right to
participate in a takeover offer within the next six months.
</P>
<P>
BHP Billiton said it had already secured a committed bank
financing facility of US$55 billion (euro38 billion).
</P>
<P>
Under the offer, Rio Tinto would hold 44 percent of the merged
entity -- more than the 36 percent of the merged group BHP
Billiton made in its earlier offer.
</P>
<P>
If the offer is successful, BHP Billiton said it will return up
to US$30 billion (euro20 billion) to shareholders through a share
buyback within 12 months of completing the acquisition.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Wednesday, BHP posted a net profit of US$6.02 billion
(euro4.11 billion) in the six months ended Dec. 31, down 2.4
percent from a year earlier because of moderating global growth.
</P>
<P>
The company's profit for the last half of 2006 was US$6.2 billion
(euro4.23 billion).
