Palestinian negotiator: Timetable for state is condition for US-
sponsored peace conference
</HEADLINE>

The chief Palestinian peace negotiator raised the stakes for a
U.S.-sponsored peace conference on Tuesday, saying there will be
no talks with Israel unless it agrees to set a deadline for
establishing a Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
Ahmed Qureia's ultimatum is the latest problem to beset already
troubled plans for the conference. Arab nations have been slow to
endorse the effort, and Israel is making only general promises
instead of specific proposals.
</P>
<P>
However, it was unclear if the Palestinians could afford to
follow through with their ultimatum, boycotting a conference
called by U.S. President George W. Bush at a time when moderate
President Mahmoud Abbas needs Western support and U.S. aid in his
struggle against the Islamic Hamas, which expelled his loyalists
and took over Gaza in June. Instead, the threat could be a ploy
to wring concessions from Israel.
</P>
<P>
In violence late Tuesday, Israeli aircraft hit a Hamas police
station in the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis, killing four
people in uniform, hospital and Hamas officials said. The Israeli
military said it targeted a Hamas position after the Islamic
group pelted southern Israel with mortar shells earlier in the
day.
</P>
<P>
Israel and the Palestinians differ over the issue of a timetable
for setting up a Palestinian state, and talks between Abbas and
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert have so far failed to solve
the impasse.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, lead Palestinian negotiator Ahmed Qureia tightened
the screws.
</P>
<P>
"The Israeli prime minister has stated that he will not accept a
timetable, and we say we will not accept negotiations without a
timetable," Qureia said at a news conference with the European
Union's external affairs commissioner, Benita Ferrero-Waldner.
</P>
<P>
Qureia indicated the talks with Israel weren't going well.
</P>
<P>
"We haven't gotten closer yet concerning the issues," he said.
"We are talking in general about the issues that should be
included in the document. (But) we haven't yet touched the core
issues."
</P>
<P>
What the Palestinians want, he said, is "a clear and specific
document, without vagueness,, that lays the basic foundation for
all final status issues. Without that, the conference will be
hindered."
</P>
<P>
Israeli government spokeswoman Miri Eisin said negotiations
should be held behind closed doors, not through the media.
</P>
<P>
"We're not at the ultimatum stage," Eisin said. "They agreed to
work to go forward, and we are committed to going forward to a
joint statement."
</P>
<P>
No date has so far been set for the peace conference in
Annapolis, Maryland, because the two sides remain so far apart on
the starting point. Israel wants a vague joint statement of
objectives, but the Palestinians want a detailed outline that
would address core issues.
</P>
<P>
These include final borders, sovereignty over disputed Jerusalem
and a solution for Palestinians who fled or were expelled from
their homes in the war that followed Israel's creation in 1948.
</P>
<P>
In the past, deadlines for establishing a Palestinian state have
been set and ignored. The latest was the "road map" plan of 2003,
a three-stage process ending in creation of a Palestinian state
in 2005. The plan stalled at the first stage.
</P>
<P>
Qureia said a U.S. envoy, Lt. Gen. Keith Dayton, is meeting with
both sides to try to revive the "road map."
</P>
<P>
In Egypt on Tuesday, Abbas lashed out against Israel for cutting
fuel supplies to Gaza in an effort to pressure militants there to
stop their daily rocket fire into southern Israel.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Israel's attorney general held up the government's
plan to cut back electricity supplies to Gaza, demanding more
work be done to prevent humanitarian harm.
</P>
<P>
"We have told the Israelis that they are wrong in adopting these
measures, which we fully reject," Abbas said after meeting with
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in Cairo. "We do not accept at
all this collective punishment."
</P>
<P>
British Foreign Secretary David Miliband criticized the Israeli
measures Tuesday. In a statement, he condemned the rocket fire
but said Israeli reprisals must "not cause suffering to innocent
civilians."
</P>
<P>
Palestinians in Gaza rely on Israel for all of their fuel and
more than half of their electricity.
</P>
<P>
If the energy cutbacks don't halt rocket attacks, then Israel
threatens an invasion. Defense Minister Ehud Barak told Army
Radio on Tuesday, "Every day that passes brings us closer to a
broad operation in Gaza."
