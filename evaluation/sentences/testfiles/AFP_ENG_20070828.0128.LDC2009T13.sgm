Fifteen people are trapped under the rubble of a high-rise
residential building that collapsed in the Azerbaijani capital
Baku on Tuesday, a spokesman for the emergency situations
ministry told AFP.
</P>
<P>
"Twenty-two workers were inside at the time, seven people escaped
and 15 remain under the rubble," ministry spokesman Tural
Museyibov said.
</P>
<P>
Museyibov said two representatives of the construction company
working on the building had been detained.

Earlier, ANS television quoted a senior emergency ministry
official, Kamil Bagirov, as saying that a preliminary
investigation had found that violations of safety rules were
behind the collapse.
</P>
<P>
Azerbaijani prosecutor general Zakir Garalov told reporters that
he had "issued an order to initiate a criminal case over this
incident based on violations of safety rules during construction
of the building."

Teams of rescuers were working to clear the rubble and search for
survivors. The neighbourhood surrounding the area was thick with
orange dust. The building was reduced to a massive pile of
mangled steel girders and crushed concrete.
</P>
<P>
Azerbaijani television showed teams of emergency workers clearing
the rubble by hand.
</P>
<P>
State-run Azerbaijan Television reported that 12 of the
building's planned 16 storeys had been completed at the time of
the collapse. Other local media reported that the building was
between 12 and 17 storeys high.
</P>
<P>
AzTV also reported that three people were pulled from the rubble,
one dead and two wounded. It said cracks had appeared in two
nearby buildings following the collapse and that the buildings
were being evacuated.
</P>
<P>
Russia's Interfax news agency earlier quoted emergency workers as
saying one person had died and one been injured.
</P>
<P>
Baku is in the midst of a major construction boom and high-rise
buildings are cropping up across the city as energy-rich
Azerbaijan enjoys record economic growth from surging oil and gas
exports.
