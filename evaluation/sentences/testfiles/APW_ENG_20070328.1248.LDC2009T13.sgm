Britain freezes contacts with Iran over detained naval crew

Iran broadcast the first pictures Wednesday of the 15 British
sailors and marines it seized last week, including a female
captive who wore a white tunic and a black head scarf and said
the British boats had "trespassed" in Iranian waters.
</P>
<P>
Britain immediately protested the airing of the footage, calling
it "completely unacceptable for these pictures to be shown on
television." Earlier in the day, Britain had announced it was
freezing all contacts with Iran apart from negotiations to free
the sailors.
</P>
<P>
The 15 have been caught in the middle of a tense dispute between
the two governments about whether the sailors were operating in
Iraqi waters when they were captured Friday, as Britain says, or
whether they had illegally entered Iranian waters, as Iran says.
</P>
<P>
In the footage aired by Al-Alam, an Arabic-language, Iranian
state-run television station, British sailor Faye Turney
contradicts her government's claim that the team had not entered
Iranian waters.
</P>
<P>
"Obviously we trespassed into their waters," Turney, 26, says on
the video. "They were very friendly and very hospitable, very
thoughtful, nice people. They explained to us why we've been
arrested, there was no harm, no aggression," she said.
</P>
<P>
Turney, sitting in a room with a floral background, was also
shown in uniform eating with sailors and marines and at one point
was shown smoking a cigarette with eyes downcast.
</P>
<P>
British officials declined to comment on whether showing the
video footage of the sailors and marines violated the Geneva
Conventions, which prohibit countries from putting captured
military personnel on display.
</P>
<P>
The chief spokesman for the International Committee of the Red
Cross also declined to comment, saying the ICRC was not involved
in the situation.
</P>
<P>
The video footage included a brief scene of what appeared to be
the British sailors sitting in an Iranian boat in open waters
immediately after their capture.
</P>
<P>
At one point, a handwritten letter from Turney is shown. In it,
Turney writes, "I have written a letter to the Iranian people to
apologize for us entering their waters."
</P>
<P>
Turney was the only person to be shown speaking in the video.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki, speaking during an
Arab leaders summit meeting in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, had said
that Turney -- the only female crew member -- could be released
later on Wednesday or on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Tony Blair called the capture of the 15 Royal Navy
crew "unacceptable, wrong and illegal." He told the House of
Commons Wednesday that it was "now time to ratchet up the
international and diplomatic pressure" on Tehran.
</P>
<P>
That included the release by the British Defense Ministry
Wednesday of GPS coordinates it said proved the 15 were in Iraqi
waters when they were arrested -- about 1.7 nautical miles inside
Iraqi waters on the Shatt al-Arab waterway. The ministry also
said the Iranians had made inconsistent designations of the
location where the incident occurred.
</P>
<P>
In a first act of retribution against Tehran, Foreign Secretary
Margaret Beckett suspended bilateral talks with Tehran on all
other issues. Visits by officials were stopped, issuing visas to
Iranian officials suspended and British support for events such
as trade missions put on hold, her office said.
</P>
<P>
President Bush spoke to British Prime Minister Tony Blair over a
secured video conference call about the standoff Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"The president fully backs Tony Blair and our allies in Britain,"
she said.
</P>
<P>
Oil prices rose by more than US$1 a barrel Wednesday as the
sailor standoff continued and on rumors that Iran had fired a
missile at a U.S. ship in the Persian Gulf.
