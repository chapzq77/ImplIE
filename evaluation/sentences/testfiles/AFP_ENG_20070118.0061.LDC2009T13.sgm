Israel 'strong enough' to handle military chief resignation: FM
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Israel's foreign minister said Thursday the country was strong
enough to withstand the resignation of its military chief who
quit over failures in the Lebanon war.
</P>
<P>
"Israel is strong enough to face these challenges. The prime
minister was elected in a democratic election," Foreign Minister
Tzipi Livni told reporters on a visit to Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
She said she had "high respect" for Lieutenant General Dan Halutz
and stressed that Israel had a separation of powers.
</P>
<P>
"I think in his resignation he expressed his values as an officer
in the Israeli army. And this is part of the values that we are
trying also to teach to our young soldiers," Livni said.
</P>
<P>
Halutz resigned Wednesday over this summer's war in Lebanon,
which came under fire in Israel for not meeting its objectives of
freeing captive Israeli soldiers and stopping Hezbollah from
attacking the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
The conflict killed more than 160 Israelis, mostly soldiers, and
more than 1,200 Lebanese, mostly civilians.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah, a Shiite Muslim militia backed by Iran and Syria,
celebrated his resignation by setting off fireworks in Beirut.
</P>
<P>
Halutz was appointed in June 2005, the first man with an air
force background to be chosen as army chief of staff.
</P>
<P>
He resigned just hours after Israel's chief prosecutor ordered a
criminal investigation against Prime Minister Ehud Olmert over a
corruption scandal and amid his plunging popularity ratings.
