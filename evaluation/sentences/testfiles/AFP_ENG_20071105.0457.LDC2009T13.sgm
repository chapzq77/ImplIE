EADS suffers fresh setback at key Airbus unit
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Aerospace group EADS sustained a fresh body blow Monday, warning
that delays to its new military aircraft will cost up to 2.0
billion dollars as it grapples with an insider trading scandal
and costly setbacks to its flagship A380 superjumbo.
</P>
<P>
The news sparked a heavy sell-off in EADS shares in early trading
here as the group disclosed that it would now have to reconsider
its operating profit projections for 2007 when it announces
quarterly results November 8.
</P>
<P>
Shares in EADS, which controls European aircraft manufacturer
Airbus, fell 4.19 percent to 21.93 euros on an overall Paris
market that was 0.66 percent weaker.
</P>
<P>
EADS, the European Aeronautic Defence and Space Company, said
delays of at least six months in deliveries of the Airbus A400M
military transporter would cost it between 1.2 and 1.4 billion
euros.
</P>
<P>
"While the calculations have not been finalised, EADS currently
estimates it will have to spend between 1.2 and 1.4 billion
euros, of which more than one billion for Airbus," the group said
in a statement.
</P>
<P>
EADS said on October 17 that delivery of the A400Ms to the French
airforce would be moved back six months to 2010 because of engine
problems. But it also warned at the time of an "additional risk
of a further slippage of six months."
</P>
<P>
"The problems with the A400M programme show that EADS has still
to demonstrate that it can overcome and improve a defective
execution strategy," said analyst Harald Liberge-Dondoux of the
bank Credit Mutuel CIC.
</P>
<P>
Revelations last month of new difficulties with the A400M
dampened some of the euphoria that had surrounded the delivery
two days earlier of the first A380, the world's largest civilian
aircraft, to Singapore Airlines.
</P>
<P>
The handover was 18 months behind schedule as the A380 has been
bedeviled by production problems dating back to March 2006, which
sparked a 93 percent slide in first half profit at EADS this year
to 71 million euros.
</P>
<P>
Scrambling to repair the damage, EADS and Airbus devised a
controversial restructuring plan that would slash thousands of
jobs at Airbus production sites, principally in France and
Germany, and in July carried out a sweeping management shakeup.
</P>
<P>
EADS scrapped a cumbersome dual Franco-German management
structure, giving the sole executive job at EADS to Louis Gallois
of France while making Thomas Enders, a German, the top man at
Airbus.
</P>
<P>
Then in early October this year EADS was rocked anew by a press
report that the French stock market regulator had prepared a
document naming around 20 top EADS executives and shareholders
alleged to have engaged in insider trading.
</P>
<P>
A Paris judge is currently looking into accusations that
management and shareholders sold their shares in the group just
before the problems with the A380 were publicly disclosed in June
2006, prompting a 26 percent plunge in the EADS shareprice.
</P>
<P>
Several of those suspected of insider trading have denied any
wrongdoing while the French government, which has a 15 percent
stake in EADS, has insisted its conduct in the matter has been
"beyond reproach."
</P>
<P>
In its statement Monday EADS said the announced costs connected
with the A400M would not cover any new difficulties that arise
with the programme.
</P>
<P>
The aircraft is Europe's response to the ageing C-130 Hercules
transporter, produced by the US firm Lockheed. EADS has said it
will have greater airlift capacity and range than both the
Hercules and the Transall, another ageing but widely used
military transport plane.
</P>
<P>
The A400M, the most important military industrial programme ever
carried out between European partners, was launched by seven
countries in May 2003. Germany has ordered 60 planes, France 50,
Spain 27, Britain 25, Turkey 10, Belgium 7 and Luxembourg 1.
