US authorities shutter worldwide spam operation

<P>
One of the largest spam operations in the world, a vast network
involving countries from New Zealand to China and the United
States, has been shut down, the Federal Trade Commission
announced Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The spammers sent out billions of e-mails in recent years
encouraging people to click through to Web sites that allegedly
used false claims to peddle prescription drugs, as well as "male
enhancement" and weight-loss pills.
</P>
<P>
The FTC has received more than 3 million complaints about the
spam and related Web sites, illustrating the scale of the
operation, officials said.
</P>
<P>
The sites, including one called "Canadian Healthcare," were
difficult to distinguish from legitimate online pharmacies --
making the pitches more persuasive, said Steve Baker, the FTC's
Midwest Region director.
</P>
<P>
"These sites are really professionally constructed," he said.
"Some years ago you used to be able to tell the bogus things
because they looked cheesy and had misspellings. Anymore, I don't
think that's true."
</P>
<P>
The operation violated the federal CAN-SPAM Act of 2003, meant to
restrict commercial spam, by using false header information to
hide the origin of messages, not offering an opt-out link and
failing to list a postal address, the FTC said.
</P>
<P>
The FTC hasn't determined a total sales figure, but it likely to
ran into the millions of dollars, Baker said.
</P>
<P>
The case should remind consumers to beware of spam, he said.
</P>
<P>
"If you find your way to these Web sites through spam, you should
really be asking yourself if you can trust them at all," Baker
said.
</P>
<P>
A federal judge in Chicago issued a temporary injunction to halt
the operation and also froze its assets. The Federal Bureau of
Investigation is investigating and those involved could also face
criminal charges, Baker said.
</P>
<P>
Those spearheading the enterprise, known as "Affking" on the
Internet, included a U.S. and a New Zealand citizen, according to
court documents.
</P>
<P>
Servers in China hosted the Web sites and the drugs were shipped
from India, while operatives in Cyprus and the former Soviet
republic of Georgia processed credit card information, Baker
said.
</P>
<P>
As part of their inquiry, FTC staff made undercover purchases
from the sites. No one asked the clandestine buyers to provide
verification of a prescription and the shipped drugs did not
include doctors' instructions or dosage information, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, federal prosecutors in Detroit have won their first
conviction in a case involving spam e-mail and efforts to
manipulate the price of Chinese stocks.
</P>
<P>
A 56-year-old East Lansing woman pleaded guilty Tuesday to
conspiracy and aiding fraud. Judy Devenow is one of 11 people
charged with illegally sending spam to generate excitement about
Chinese stocks.
</P>
<P>
Devenow worked for Alan Ralsky of suburban Detroit, who is
accused of running the spam scam. Authorities say he made $3
million just in summer 2005 by trading in and out of Chinese
stocks on U.S. exchanges.
</P>
<P>
Devenow says she was paid $150,000 to send several million
e-mails a day from January 2004 through September 2005. She has
agreed to cooperate with prosecutors against her co-defendants.
