OBAMA UNAWARE OF STATUS OF AUNT, CAMPAIGN SAYS (SUBS for rewrite,
with new comments from officials; NO PICKUP.) Reporting was
contributed by Abby Goodnough, Eric Lipton, Michael Luo and Jeff
Zeleny.      WASHINGTON
</P>
<P>
Responding to a report that a Kenyan relative of Sen. Barack
Obama was living in the United States illegally, his campaign on
Saturday said that he had no knowledge of her immigration status
and that "any and all appropriate laws" should be followed.
</P>
<P>
The woman, Zeituni Onyango, referred to as "Auntie Zeituni" in a
passage in Obama's memoir, applied for political asylum in the
United States in 2004, but a federal immigration judge rejected
her request and instructed her to leave the country, said a
government official with knowledge of the case who asked not to
be identified because of its sensitive nature. Onyango's legal
status was first reported by The Associated Press on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The disclosure came as the presidential campaign hurtled toward
Election Day on Tuesday, and it left the Obama campaign answering
questions about what he knew of her situation.
</P>
<P>
Some Democrats suggested that the timing of the disclosure could
have been politically motivated, and some immigration lawyers
said that for government officials to disclose information about
an asylum applicant was unethical or perhaps illegal.
</P>
<P>
"People are suspicious about stories that surface in the last 72
hours of a national campaign, and I think they're going to put it
in that context," David Axelrod, Obama's chief strategist, told
reporters on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Sen. John McCain's campaign declined to comment, and neither
McCain nor his running mate, Gov. Sarah Palin, raised the issue
on the campaign trail.
</P>

Kelly Nantel, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Immigration and Customs
Enforcement Agency, said that the matter had been referred to the
agency's inspector general and office of professional
responsibility. Nantel said that she could not comment on the
matter. A White House spokesman, Scott Stanzel, said the White
House had no involvement in the matter. Onyango is the half-
sister of Obama's father and is part of an extensive network of
paternal relatives with whom Obama has had limited contact, his
aides said. Obama, who was largely raised by his maternal
grandparents in Honolulu, first met Onyango when he traveled to
Africa as an adult.
</P>
<P>
Axelrod said that Obama and Onyango did not have "a real close
relationship."
</P>
<P>
Onyango attended the ceremony when Obama was sworn in to the U.S.
Senate in 2004, but campaign officials said the senator had
provided no assistance in getting her a tourist visa and did not
know the details of her stay. At the time of the ceremony,
Onyango and another relative said in interviews that they had
flown to the United States from Kenya to witness the moment.
</P>
<P>
Obama last heard from her about two years ago when she called to
say she was in Boston, but he did not see her there, the campaign
said.
</P>
<P>
Federal Election Commission records list a Zeituni Onyango in
South Boston as making a series of contributions, totaling $265,
to the Obama campaign, with the most recent contribution, $5,
made on Sept. 19.
</P>
<P>
Obama's campaign said the money was being refunded. It is illegal
for foreign citizens and immigrants without green cards to make
political donations. Aides said that the donations came through
the normal channels, and that no one at the campaign knew that
Onyango was related to Obama or of her immigration status.
</P>
<P>
The Times of London first reported on Thursday that Onyango lived
in public housing in Boston. On Friday, The Associated Press
reported that she was in the country illegally and that her case
had led to an unusual nationwide directive from the Immigrations
and Customs Enforcement requiring that any deportations before
Tuesday's election be approved at least at the level of regional
directors.
</P>
<P>
Onyango lives in a disabled-access apartment, and worked as a
volunteer resident health advocate for the Boston Housing
Authority before stopping recently for physical therapy following
back surgery, said William McGonagle, deputy director of the
authority.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, a police officer was stationed outside the low brick
public housing complex where Onyango lives. The officer said she
was not at home and told reporters not to enter the building.
