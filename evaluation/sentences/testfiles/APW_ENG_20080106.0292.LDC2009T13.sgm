TBILISI, Georgia 2008-01-06 10:36:00 UTC

<P>
President Mikhail Saakashvili headed for victory in Georgia's
election, according to an exit poll and early results released
Sunday, but the opposition claimed the vote was rigged and called
for protests.
</P>
<P>
Saakashvili's supporters waved flags and tooted car horns in the
capital after the exit poll showed him winning 53.8 percent of
the vote Saturday. But the poll had a margin of error of plus or
minus 3 percentage points -- casting doubt on whether the
president would hang onto the absolute majority needed to avoid a
runoff.
</P>
<P>
Early results released by the Central Election Commission Sunday
also indicated Saakashvili was poised for victory. With some 3
percent of precincts counted, Saakashvili had 61.5 percent, while
his main challenger Levan Gachechiladze received 21.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
Gachechiladze, received 28.3 percent of the vote, according to
the exit poll, which the opposition said was falsified.
</P>
<P>
About two hours before the polls closed Saturday night, the head
of an international election-monitoring mission said the election
appeared fair.
</P>
<P>
"From what we're seeing now ... there does not appear to be
anything to suggest there is an election being stolen," said U.S.
Rep. Alcee Hastings, heading a mission sent by the Organization
for Security and Cooperation in Europe.
</P>
<P>
But opposition leaders said the campaign was held under unfair
conditions and claimed there were widespread violations during
the vote.
</P>
<P>
Gachechiladze, speaking on television early Sunday, claimed he
had won in most precincts and the vote count was being held under
conditions of "terror." He called for protests Sunday afternoon,
urging "all of Georgia to come to make sure we don't lose our
country."
</P>
<P>
Saakashvili, while still waiting for official results, said the
exit poll showed him winning and called for reconciliation in a
speech to supporters at a celebratory concert.
</P>
<P>
"If the final results confirm that I have won in the first round,
then I will assume the honor and responsibility to serve all of
Georgia for the next five years," he said. "I'm extending my hand
to those who voted for me and to those who took part in the
elections," he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-educated Saakashvili led mass street protests that
ousted a Communist-era veteran from power following fraudulent
elections in late 2003. He won a January 2004 election with more
than 96 percent of the vote and set out to transform the bankrupt
country into a modern European state.
</P>
<P>
Now the Rose Revolution hero, who was much lauded in the West, is
accused by his opponents at home of sidelining his critics and
displaying an authoritarian bent.
</P>
<P>
After casting his ballot in Tbilisi, Saakashvili said he was
dedicated to having a free and fair election. "We are committed
to having Georgia as a beacon of democracy in our part of the
world," he said.
</P>
<P>
Saakashvili's opponents took to the streets in November, holding
peaceful demonstrations for five days before police violently
dispersed them. Saakashvili imposed a state of emergency that
included banning independent TV news broadcasts.
</P>
<P>
The violent crackdown angered many Georgians and called into
question Saakashvili's commitment to democracy. Saakashvili
defused the crisis by calling an early election, cutting short
his own five-year term.
</P>
<P>
A runoff vote could allow the opposition, now split among six
candidates, to unite behind Gachechiladze, a businessman and
lawmaker.
</P>
<P>
Gachechiladze, 43, represents an opposition coalition that wants
to do away with the presidency. If a parliamentary system is
established, as the coalition wants, he would step down.
</P>
<P>
The opposition has been undermined by a scandal that has
discredited one of the leading candidates, billionaire Badri
Patarkatsishvili. He has been accused of plotting to overthrow
the government and has acknowledged offering large sums of money
to police if they side with protesters. Georgian authorities say
he offered US$100 million (euro68 million).
</P>
<P>
The exit poll showed Patarkatsishvili finishing third with 6.2
percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
Saakashvili says the election has put at stake his plan to
transform Georgia into a country worthy of membership in NATO and
the European Union. Sixty-one percent of voters approved of
joining the Western military alliance in a referendum that was
held alongside the Saturday election, according to the exit poll.
</P>
<P>
During his four years in office, he has cracked down on organized
crime and corruption, modernized the police force and the army,
restored steady supplies of electricity and gas, and improved
roads. The result has been annual economic growth of about 10
percent and a steady rise in foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
The economic success has not yet defeated poverty, and after the
November protests, Saakashvili made social welfare one of his top
priorities.
