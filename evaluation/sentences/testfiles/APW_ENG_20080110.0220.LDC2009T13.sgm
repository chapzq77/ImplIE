Australian aluminum producer Alumina Ltd. downgraded its
underlying earnings forecast for last year by 17 percent Thursday
to 405 million Australian dollars (US$358 million; euro244
million).
</P>
<P>
It said lower-than-expected aluminum prices, higher costs and a
stronger Australian dollar led to the downgrade in its
announcement of the revision to the Australian Securities
Exchange.
</P>
<P>
It had forecast in July 2007 underlying earnings of $A490 million
(US$433 million; euro295 million) for the year to Dec. 31, 2007.
</P>
<P>
Alumina's chief financial officer Ken Dean said the cost
pressures that forced the earnings downgrade look set to continue
in 2008.
</P>
<P>
Dean said rising freight and energy prices accounted for much of
the production cost increases and the company does not expect any
relief from these in 2008.
</P>
<P>
"We don't necessarily see them getting worse, but we don't really
think the 2008 outlook looks very different to the second half of
2007," he told Dow Jones Newswires.
</P>
<P>
Dean said he believes, though, given the outlook for the market,
that there is now potential for aluminum prices to rise.
</P>
<P>
"I think there are some fundamentals that give you some
indication that sooner or later the higher costs of production
will flow through to higher realized prices," he said.
</P>
<P>
Alumina said the July forecast had assumed an average 2007
aluminum price on the London Metal Exchange of US$1.24 per pound
and an exchange rate of 83 U.S. cents to one Australian dollar.
</P>
<P>
But the company now says that the average aluminum price for last
year had come in at US$1.21 per pound and the average exchange
rate for the year was 84 U.S. cents to the Australian unit.
</P>
<P>
Refining costs were also substantially higher for 2007 than was
earlier estimated.
