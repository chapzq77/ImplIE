Slovak doctors have successfully separated twins joined at the
chest in what was the second operation of this kind in the
country, an official said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The 5-month-old twin boys were separated during almost a 20-hour
operation that was successfully concluded Saturday, said Daniel
Zitnan, the head of Bratislava's Children University Hospital.

<P>
Zitnan said that the two, named Marek and Misko, were in stable
condition but it was too soon to say what their chances for
recovery recover were. He said the most difficult task for the
doctors was to separate the liver and the gall bladder that the
baby boys shared.

<P>
The operation was necessary for their survival, Zitnan said.
</P>
<P>
"I do thank the doctors and nurses from my heart," the boys'
mother, Marianna Muellerova, was quoted as saying on Sme daily's
Web site Saturday. "I have an enormous admiration for them."
</P>
<P>
Zitnan said it was the second surgery of this kind in Slovakia.
In 2000, doctors successfully separated two baby girls who are
now doing well, he said.
