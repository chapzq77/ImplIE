Ex-prosecutor in Detroit terror trial acquitted of conspiring to
hide evidence

<P>
A jury on Wednesday acquitted a former federal prosecutor of
charges that he conspired to hide evidence in America's first
major terrorism trial after the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks.
</P>
<P>
The government said Richard Convertino, a former assistant U.S.
attorney, so badly wanted to see convictions in the terrorism
case, which went to trial in 2003, that he broke the law himself.
But lawyers for Convertino argued he did nothing wrong and had no
reason to conspire to hide evidence.
</P>
<P>
The jury also acquitted Harry Smith III, an ex-U.S. State
Department investigator, in the case.
</P>
<P>
"It's a just end to a politically motivated prosecution,"
Convertino, 46, said after the verdict was read.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors say Convertino was e-mailed photos of a Jordanian
hospital that should have been turned over to the defense at the
2003 trial. And prosecutors say Convertino allowed Smith to
testify that it would be difficult to get photos of the hospital
even though they both knew photos existed.
</P>
<P>
"We believe in the case and the importance to the system and
respect the jury's verdict," said government lawyer Daniel
Schwager.
</P>
<P>
The defense said the government didn't prove that Convertino
intentionally withheld the photos and no conspiracy existed.
Smith's lawyer Thomas Cranmer also argued that his client's
testimony was truthful.
</P>
<P>
Outside the courtroom, Cranmer said Smith was relieved by the
verdict. "Overall, the prosecution's case -- at least to me --
didn't make sense and I was hopeful the jury would see that,"
Cranmer said.
</P>
<P>
Jurors started deliberations in the case Wednesday morning
following nearly three weeks of testimony before U.S. District
Judge Arthur Tarnow, and reached the verdict after less than a
day of deliberations.
</P>
<P>
For two years, Convertino led the government's case against four
North African men accused of operating a "sleeper" terrorist
cell. Two of the four, Karim Koubriti and Abdel-Ilah Elmardoudi,
were convicted in 2003 of conspiring to provide material support
and resources to terrorists, and Convertino won praise from the
Bush administration for his successful convictions.
</P>
<P>
Smith helped in the investigation and testified for the
government at the trial.
</P>
<P>
A federal judge overturned the 2003 verdicts at the Justice
Department's request after prosecutors discovered that some
documents that could have aided the defense during the trial were
not turned over by the government as required.
</P>
<P>
Convertino and Smith were indicted last year on charges of
obstruction of justice, making false declarations before a court
and conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
The indictment said the photographs of the Jordanian hospital
could have helped defense lawyers at the 2003 trial undermine a
government argument about how well a surveillance sketch of the
hospital matched reality. The sketch was found in an apartment
used by part of the suspected Detroit cell.
</P>
<P>
But the defense at the current trial said the photos would have
helped prosecutors at the 2003 trial.
