student activists

The mothers of two missing student activists filed a petition
Wednesday urging the Philippine Supreme Court to compel the
military to release the women, claiming soldiers had abducted
them more than a year ago.
</P>
<P>
The mothers of Sherlyn Cadapan and Karen Empeno, who disappeared
last June northwest of Manila, invoked the court's new "writ of
amparo" rule, which allows judges to order authorities to find
missing persons as part of efforts to protect civil liberties
amid a spate of extrajudicial killings blamed on soldiers.
</P>
<P>
The mothers asked for the release of their daughters and a
farmer, Manuel Merino, from military custody if they are still
alive, or for the military to disclose the location of their
graves. They also want to be allowed to inspect military
detention areas to look for their daughters.
</P>
<P>
They named President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, military chief Gen.
Hermogenes Esperon, national police chief Avelino Razon, two
retired generals and two colonels among the respondents.
</P>
<P>
Military officials earlier denied they were holding the students.
</P>
<P>
The mothers claim their daughters were taken by soldiers from a
house in Hagonoy township, 40 kilometers (25 miles) northwest of
Manila, on June 26, 2006. Members of a local human rights group
said they saw a jeep with the same license plate number as the
vehicle used by the abductors at the 56th Infantry Battalion's
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
The petitioners cited new evidence, including an account by
Adoracion Paulino, Capadan's mother-in-law, who said Cadapan was
escorted by soldiers to her house on April 11, 2007. Cadapan took
some clothes and left without speaking because she was being
tightly guarded, Paulino said.
</P>
<P>
The petition also cited the testimony of brothers Raymund and
Reynaldo Manalo, who said they escaped military detention and
sought protection from the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
The two men said they were with Cadapan, Empeno and Merino in a
military camp in Bataan, northwest of Manila, where they said
Merino was killed.
</P>
<P>
Activists have expressed hope that the "writ of amparo," or rules
of protection, which took effect Wednesday, will help the
families of missing persons find their loved ones.
</P>
<P>
"It is now up to the Supreme Court to make the law work and
protect us," said Cadapan's mother, Erlinda.
</P>
<P>
The human rights group Karapatan says nearly 200 people, mostly
left-wing activists, have disappeared over the past six years,
and more than 800 others have been killed since 2001.
</P>
<P>
The military says the figures are exaggerated and has denied
involvement, but Esperon recently revealed that 13 soldiers are
being investigated for involvement in killings.
