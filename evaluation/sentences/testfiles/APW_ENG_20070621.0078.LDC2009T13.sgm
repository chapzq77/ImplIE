Famed American World War II cemetery in France gets visitor

Photos of fresh-faced privates, wizened U.S. generals and the
largest amphibious military operation in history. Dented army
canteens that once dotted killing fields in France. The booming
sounds of gunships echoing over the waves in Normandy -- this
time, on video.

The Normandy American Cemetery in Colleville-sur-Mer, best known
for its sober rows of white grave markers honoring fallen U.S.
troops in World War II, has at last gotten a visitor's center.
</P>
<P>
Nearly a million visitors trek every year to the cemetery
overlooking Omaha Beach, one of the two landing points where U.S.
troops stormed ashore on D-Day -- June 6, 1944 -- and helped the
Allies rid the menace of Nazi Germany over Europe.
</P>
<P>
Six years in the making, the new center was inaugurated recently
by U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates for the 63rd anniversary
of the start of "Operation Overlord" that helped end the war.
</P>
<P>
"We build memorials like this to remind us of the past. So that
successive generations will know the enormous cost of freedom,"
Gates said at the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Designers faced a delicate task balancing the desire to educate
while not overshadowing sacrifices of nearly 10,000 Americans
buried nearby.
</P>
<P>
The US$30 million (euro22.4 million) visitor center is purposely
understated, with most of the 10,000-square-feet (929-square-
meters) of display space underground, though it is now the
entryway for tourists onto the cemetery's manicured lawn.
</P>
<P>
"The cemetery has always had this extremely powerful emotional
component," said Macarena Aristegui of the American Battle
Monuments Commission, which runs the cemetery and memorial. "What
was lacking was a story to go with the names written on the
headstones."
</P>
<P>
The site is one of the most visited U.S. military cemeteries in
the world. It draws veterans' relatives, many of them Americans
who feel proud of their country's contribution to the liberation
of France and Europe, as well as veterans themselves whose
numbers are dwindling -- but who still have many thoughts for
their fallen comrades-in-arms.
</P>
<P>
The center displays scratched and dented weapons, photos of
soldiers who carried them, and excerpts from letters they sent
home. It also shows documentary films and news reports about the
war's progress.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Congressmen David Obey, D-Wis., and John Murtha, D-Pa.,
proposed building the center in 2001, and it was designed by
French-American architect Nicolas Kelemen. The first stone was
laid two years ago.
</P>
<P>
Some 200 American World War II veterans were on hand for the
center's June 6, 2007, inauguration, along with 15 who had fought
on the beaches, some of whom hadn't been back since the war,
Aristegui said.
</P>
<P>
Admission to the visitor center is free. A small private room is
available for veterans and their families to give them privacy
before or after a visit to the cemetery.
