Former first lady Nancy Reagan was in a hospital early Monday
after taking a tumble in her Bel-Air home.
</P>
<P>
Reagan, 86, was doing well after falling on Sunday morning,
spokeswoman Joanne Drake said. Reagan was taken to St. John's
Health Center, where doctors determined she did not break a hip
as initially feared.
</P>
<P>
Drake said Reagan stayed the night in the same room where former
President Ronald Reagan stayed after he broke his hip at home in
2001. He died June 5, 2004, after a 10-year battle with
Alzheimer's disease. The two were married for 52 years.
</P>
<P>
Reagan's family physician recommended the overnight stay "as a
precaution," Drake said. The former first lady was expected to be
released from the hospital later Monday.
</P>
<P>
"She's joking and visiting in her room," Drake said.
</P>
<P>
A message left for a hospital spokesman Sunday night was not
immediately returned.
</P>
<P>
Nancy Reagan's last major public appearance was at the Jan. 30
Republican presidential debate at the Reagan Library in Simi
Valley, California, where she sat with Gov. Arnold
Schwarzenegger.
</P>
<P>
She did not attend a 97th birthday celebration held for her late
husband at the library on Feb. 6.
