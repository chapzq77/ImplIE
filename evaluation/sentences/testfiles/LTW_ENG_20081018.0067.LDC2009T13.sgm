raising student achievement among poor minorities via
collaborating with parents and community services.

To educate the lowest achieving students (who are most often
poor, in rural isolation, or from marginalized minorities), it
will be necessary to turn traditional schooling on its conceptual
head. The current, mechanical, input-output model that pervades
our schooling system and focuses immediately on curriculum,
instruction, and assessment must be changed to a model that
focuses primarily on relationships, creating a positive culture,
and student development.
</P>
<P>
What reads like a slight difference is a huge and profound change
in practice. Development and learning are inextricably linked and
take place through a critical dynamic: From birth caretakers
interact with the young in ways that make emotional attachment
and bonding possible. Through this arrangement, as the young act
on their environment to build their own survival and expressive
capacities, they can imitate, identify with, and internalize the
attitudes, values and life management styles of their meaningful
caretakers.
</P>
<P>
Also, through this arrangement, caretakers can mediate the
physical (including brain construction), psycho-emotional, moral-
ethical, linguistic, cognitive-academic learning growth and
development of children and students. Most students from
mainstream backgrounds -- regardless of their socioeconomic,
racial or regional backgrounds -- experience this dynamic.
Children who do not come from mainstream backgrounds, or who have
a non-mainstream experience, are more likely to be
underdeveloped, or differently developed, and are less likely to
be successful in school and in life.
</P>
<P>
Such children often lack the competencies, confidence and sense
of belonging needed to perform well in school. They often
withhold or withdraw, or act in inappropriate ways as they sense
failure in the school setting. Nonetheless, many of these
students are from vibrant and meaningful subcultures. Their
emotional attachment to kin, friends and the cultural
organizations to which they feel they belong is very powerful.
Many of these students, even when making academic progress in
school, may eventually be highly conflicted about or reject the
mainstream school and life culture if there are no positive
sanctions and there is no collaboration between home, school, and
community.
</P>
<P>
Most teachers and administrators -- through no fault of their own
-- are not prepared to create school cultures that create a sense
of belonging, support student development, and positively
sanction activities and behaviors that make success possible in
school and in the mainstream of the society. Student
underdevelopment and staff under-preparation is the major reason
that capable students are performing badly.
</P>
<P>
The way to change this is simple to state, but difficult to bring
about. The entire 3 to 4 million-person education workforce needs
to create the kind of school culture that supports development,
teaching, academic success and life preparation. There is
evidence that this can be done. But leadership within each
element of the education enterprise -- parents, teachers, school
administrators, policymakers at every level and school staff
preparatory programs -- must work collaboratively and
synchronously to make it possible.
</P>
<P>
With a focus on the underlying problem, commitment to and an
appropriate framework for change, it will be possible to educate
all children well.
