Asia signs 'green region' environment pact
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Leaders of 16 Asian nations including China and India signed a
pact on the environment Wednesday, pledging action on climate
change and forest cover, and promoting the use of nuclear energy.
</P>
<P>
The East Asia Summit members threw their support behind a UN plan
as the "core mechanism" for tackling global warming.
</P>
<P>
They committed to work harder to develop alternative energy
sources and cleaner fossil-fuel technologies, and to improve
energy efficiency and conservation.
</P>
<P>
The East Asia Summit, which embraces the 10-nation ASEAN bloc
plus Australia, China, India, Japan, New Zealand and South Korea,
now sets the stage for next month's UN-backed global climate
change talks in Bali.
</P>
<P>
After the United Nations warned that illegal logging is
devastating Southeast Asia's tropical rain forests, the leaders
set a goal to increase forest cover by at least 15 million
hectares (37 million acres) by 2020.
</P>
<P>
They also agreed to cooperate on the "development and the use of
civilian nuclear power," amid concerns soaring oil prices could
hurt regional economic growth, according to their joint
declaration.
</P>
<P>
But they stressed that the use of atomic energy will be carried
out in a "manner ensuring nuclear safety, security and non-
proliferation" by adopting safeguards within the framework of the
International Atomic Energy Agency watchdog.
</P>
<P>
Environmental groups have voiced concerns over the disposal of
nuclear waste and the danger that plutonium -- a key ingredient
for making atomic weapons -- could fall into the wrong hands.
</P>
<P>
A key focus of concern is Southeast Asian extremist group Jemaah
Islamiyah, blamed for a series of attacks in the region including
the 2002 Bali bombings that killed 202 people.
</P>
<P>
The 16 nations also agreed to work towards reducing energy
intensity -- a measure of the energy efficiency of a nation's
economy -- but dropped plans to aim for a 25 percent reduction by
2030.
</P>
<P>
An earlier draft of the declaration obtained by AFP indicated
that India had objected to the 25 percent goal.
</P>
<P>
Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer expressed optimism
that China and India would agree to eventually cut greenhouse gas
emissions and said the East Asia Summit pact helped "pave the way
for a successful Bali meeting."
</P>
<P>
"I think there has been a turning of the tide in terms of China
and India's positions on climate change," Downer told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"Now we are at last seeing these major developing countries
saying yes, we need to do things as well to stabilise greenhouse
gas emissions," he said.
</P>
<P>
Two of the world's worst polluters, China and India ratified the
Kyoto Protocol on climate change but, as developing nations, were
not obliged to achieve fixed emissions reduction targets.
</P>
<P>
Delegates to the Bali talks will discuss a successor treaty to
the Kyoto Protocol, which developed nations say must push China
and India to cut pollution.
</P>
<P>
China's Prime Minister Wen Jiabao said earlier Wednesday that he
will seek to increase cooperation with Asian nations on climate
change and that the country will try to freeze its key pollution
emissions at 2005 levels.
</P>
<P>
He said he would propose an international climate change forum in
China next year to improve the region's ability to address global
warming.
</P>
<P>
Japanese Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda also unveiled a hefty two-
billion-dollar aid package over five years for developing Asian
nations to help them tackle climate change.
</P>
<P>
It includes soft loans and training programmes aimed at helping
developing nations address the issue while pursuing economic
growth, and is focused on improving sewage processing and
fighting pollution.
