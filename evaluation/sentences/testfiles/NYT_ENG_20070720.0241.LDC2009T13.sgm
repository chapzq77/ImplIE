EUROPE, U.S. WITHDRAW KOSOVO INDEPENDENCE MEASURE
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS
</P>
<P>
The European and American sponsors of a resolution that would put
Kosovo on the path to independence withdrew the measure from the
Security Council on Friday in the face of a promised Russian veto
and said a six-nation European group would now seek a way to
settle the contentious statehood question.
</P>
<P>
"We regret that it has been impossible to secure such a
resolution in the United Nations Security Council," said Jean-
Marc de la Sabliere, the French ambassador. "We will therefore
put on hold discussions of the resolution."
</P>
<P>
He made the announcement after a morning meeting held to test the
ongoing Russian resistance to the resolution despite repeated
revisions adopted in recent weeks to try to meet Moscow's
objections.
</P>
<P>
Vitaly I. Churkin, the Russian ambassador, said he had told the
15 council ambassadors that Russia was not prepared to vote yes
or to abstain, leaving a veto the sure response if a vote were
called.
</P>
<P>
Asked beforehand why the sponsors would not allow a vote to go
forward and let the Russians cast their veto, Emyr Jones Parry,
the British ambassador, said, "We didn't want high drama, which
might have had consequences in the region."
</P>
<P>
De la Sabliere said the so-called contact group -- Britain,
France, Germany, Italy, Russia and the United States -- would
meet on Wednesday in Vienna, Austria, and start a process of
talks on Kosovo that would be limited to 120 days.
</P>
<P>
Asked if the sponsors were "abandoning" the Security Council,
Zalmay Khalilzad, the American ambassador, said, "The council is
blocked." He declined to say whether the issue would return here
one day.
</P>
<P>
The resolution was an attempt to provide a managed way to move
Kosovo to statehood with protection for the 10 percent Serbian
minority and promised membership in the European Union.
</P>
<P>
The original resolution was modeled on a plan for "supervised
independence" developed by Martti Ahtisaari, the U.S. envoy who
delivered the proposed resolution to the Security Council in
March, saying that 13 months of direct negotiations between
Belgrade and Pristina has produced an impasse.
</P>
<P>
The series of language changes made since then removed the
certainty of an outcome promising independence, but Churkin, the
Russian ambassador, held that the measure was still "permeated
with independence for Kosovo" and therefore unacceptable. Earlier
this week he bluntly portrayed its chance for passage as "zero."
