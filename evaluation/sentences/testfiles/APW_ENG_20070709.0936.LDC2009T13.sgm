4 guilty of plotting suicide bombing attack on London ' s transit
system

LONDON 2007-07-09 17:53:07 UTC
</P>
<P>
Four men were convicted Monday of plotting to bomb London's
public transport system on July 21, 2005 -- an attack with
deliberate echoes of suicide bombings that killed 52 commuters on
the network two weeks earlier.
</P>
<P>
Inspired by al-Qaida, the four attempted to detonate explosives-
laden backpacks on three subway trains and a bus, as in the July
7, 2005, attacks. The devices -- made from a volatile mix of
hydrogen peroxide and flour -- failed to explode, and no one was
injured.
</P>
<P>
A jury unanimously found Muktar Said Ibrahim, 29; Yassin Omar,
26; and Ramzi Mohammed, 25, guilty of conspiracy to murder.
Several hours later they returned another guilty verdict on
Hussain Osman, 28.
</P>
<P>
Unlike the July 7 bombers, who were British-born, those in the
July 21 plot had come to Britain as young men from places like
Eritrea, Ethiopia and Somalia in the war-wracked Horn of Africa.
There was no indication any were in the country illegally -- some
had become British citizens, others had refugee status.
</P>
<P>
The verdicts, at the end of a six-month trial, came days after
police uncovered a plot to detonate car bombs in London's
entertainment district and two men rammed a flaming Jeep Cherokee
into Glasgow International Airport.
</P>
<P>
The jury was still deliberating on two alleged accomplices. Judge
Adrian Fulford told the jury of nine women and three men he would
accept 10-2 majority verdicts on the other two defendants, Manfo
Kwaku Asiedu, 34; and Adel Yahya, 24.
</P>
<P>
All six suspects denied the charges, saying the devices were duds
and their actions a protest against the Iraq war. But police and
prosecutors said scientific tests proved the bombs were all
viable. They do not know why they did not work.
</P>
<P>
The gang convicted Monday had bought 442 liters (117 gallons) of
hydrogen peroxide -- an easily available chemical commonly used
for bleaching and coloring hair. At a makeshift "bomb factory" in
Omar's north London apartment, they boiled the chemical to a
concentration of 70 percent to increase its explosive potential.
</P>
<P>
The bombs' main explosive charge was 70 percent liquid hydrogen
peroxide and 30 percent flour of the sort used to make chapatis,
a type of Indian flat bread.
</P>
<P>
The explosives were packed in plastic tubs, with screws, bolts
and other pieces of metal taped to the outside as shrapnel. The
detonators contained triacetone triperoxide (TATP), an explosive
used by the July 7 bombers.
</P>
<P>
Omar, Mohammed and Osman tried to set off their devices aboard
three subway trains; a couple of hours later, Ibrahim's bomb
failed aboard a double-decker bus.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors say Asiedu lost his nerve and abandoned his device in
a London park. Yahya left Britain for Ethiopia several weeks
before the attacks.
</P>
<P>
During the trial, Asiedu turned on the others and claimed
Ibrahim, the gang's self-proclaimed leader, had wanted the
attacks "to be bigger and better" than the July 7 bombs.
</P>
<P>
The botched plot rattled a city already shaken by the July 7
attacks, as detectives launched the biggest manhunt in British
history.
</P>
<P>
A day after the failed attacks, police shot dead Jean Charles de
Menezes, a Brazilian electrician they mistook for one of the
bombers.
</P>
<P>
Police said they were under enormous pressure to capture the men,
uncertain over whether they would try again and anxious to avoid
a repeat of the aftermath of the hunt for terrorists responsible
for the 2004 Madrid train bombings. Then, suspects killed a
police officer and themselves when they exploded booby traps as
police stormed their hideout.
</P>
<P>
Most of the suspects were arrested in England a few days after
the attacks. Osman fled to Italy and was detained in Rome a week
later.
</P>
<P>
Giving evidence at the trial, a specialist firearms officer,
identified only as PC 7512, described how he almost shot Omar
dead when police tracked him down to a house in Birmingham,
central England, and found him standing in a bathtub, fully
clothed and wearing a backpack.
</P>
<P>
"In all honesty, I still don't know to this day how I did not
shoot him," said the officer, describing how his submachine gun
was trained on Omar's head.
</P>
<P>
Much of the prosecution's case was based on eyewitness testimony
and closed circuit television footage from the targeted subway
cars and bus.
</P>
<P>
In one of the most chilling pieces of footage, Mohammed attempts
to detonate his charge with his backpack facing a mother and
young child. Moments, later passengers are seen running to the
other side of a carriage, while an off-duty firefighter, Angus
Campbell, remonstrates with Mohammed.
</P>
<P>
Police believe the planning for the attack started after Ibrahim
returned to Britain from a trip to Pakistan in March 2005. He was
in the country at the same time as two of the July 7 bombers --
Shezhad Tanweer and Mohammed Sidique Khan -- but officials do not
know if they ever met.
</P>
<P>
They believe the transit system was not the group's original
target, but was chosen following the successful attacks two weeks
earlier. Their original target is unknown.
</P>
<P>
Following the men's arrests, police acknowledged they had video
evidence of Ibrahim at a training camp in the northern English
countryside taken a year before the attacks but had failed to
identify him.
