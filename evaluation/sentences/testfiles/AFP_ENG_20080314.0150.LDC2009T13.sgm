Case against suspected Russian arms dealer 'all lies': brother
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The case against Viktor Bout, the alleged Russian arms dealer
dubbed the "Merchant of Death" who was arrested in Thailand last
week, is fabricated and unjust, his brother told AFP on Friday.
</P>
<P>
"If he's such a bandit, then show me some facts. If you can't,
then it's all lies," Sergei Bout, 47, who said he worked with his
brother in the 1990s, said in an interview. "He's just a normal
guy," he added.
</P>
<P>
Viktor Bout, 41, was arrested last week in an elaborate sting
operation by Thai police and US agents following a 12-month
undercover operation, and held on charges of conspiring to
provide arms to Colombian rebels.
</P>
<P>
US authorities have accused Bout of trafficking weapons around
the world.
</P>
<P>
But Sergei said the operation to arrest his brother was a
"provocation" by the United States and added that his brother was
only a "transporter" of air cargo who never knew what the planes
he chartered were carrying.
</P>
<P>
"So far there are no charges against him... This is lawlessness,"
said the charcoal-haired Sergei, who was dressed in a black
T-shirt during the interview in a central Moscow restaurant.
</P>
<P>
Sergei said Viktor Bout's family and business associates were
preparing a documentary film about Bout's life. The film, which
will include revelations about Bout's activities in Africa, will
be called "Who Are You, Viktor Bout?"
