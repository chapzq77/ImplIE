Illinois lawmakers to focus on ousting governor
</HEADLINE>

<P>
SPRINGFIELD, Illinois 2008-12-15 14:33:54 UTC
</P>
<P>
Illinois lawmakers could begin impeachment proceedings Monday
against Gov. Rod Blagojevich, who has been accused of seeking
bribes for the Senate seat vacated by President-elect Barack
Obama.
</P>
<P>
State legislators were to meet Monday afternoon for the first
time since Blagojevich was arrested last week on charges related
to the Senate seat and that he tried to get businesses seeking
state deals to pay up. As governor, Blagojevich holds the power
to appoint a new U.S. senator representing the state.
</P>
<P>
The session's focus was supposed to be about considering a
special election, but impeachment is likely to be the chief topic
of conversation.
</P>
<P>
Republicans and Democrats alike were calling for the state
lawmakers to act quickly.
</P>
<P>
"The General Assembly must move to impeach Rod Blagojevich
immediately," said DuPage County State's Attorney Joe Birkett, a
potential Republican candidate for governor in 2010.
</P>
<P>
"We should have started yesterday," agreed Democratic Rep. Jack
Franks.
</P>
<P>
Blagojevich emerged briefly from his house early Monday but
answered no questions from reporters. Spokesman Lucio Guerrero
said the governor "has no plans on resigning Monday."
</P>
<P>
Guerrero didn't respond directly to whether the governor could or
would do anything to slow down the Legislature's move toward
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
"The governor has indicated in the past there is more to this
story that he's wanting to tell at an appropriate time," he said.
</P>
<P>
The calls for impeachment put the spotlight on House Speaker
Michael Madigan, who ultimately will decide the timing of any
impeachment effort.
</P>
<P>
Madigan, a Democrat representing Chicago, hasn't taken any public
position beyond saying Sunday that he will talk to the House
Republican leader about the issue Monday.
</P>
<P>
David Dring, spokesman for House Minority Leader Tom Cross, said
Republicans will step up the pressure on Democrats to remove
their fellow party member Blagojevich, perhaps raising the issue
on the House floor.
</P>
<P>
"If they won't work with us, you'll probably see some good
theater," Dring said.
</P>
<P>
The Republicans also plan to run television ads pressuring
Democrats to approve a special election to replace Obama.
Blagojevich still holds the power to appoint a new senator, and
if he resigned, that power would go to Democratic Lt. Gov.
Patrick Quinn.
</P>
<P>
Madigan often has clashed with the Democratic governor, and his
office produced a memo this year outlining all the arguments
legislative candidates could make in favor of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
But spokesman Steve Brown wouldn't say Sunday whether Madigan was
even considering impeachment proceedings. Brown said Madigan
wants to "maintain some neutrality" in case he winds up presiding
over an impeachment.
</P>
<P>
Madigan's daughter, Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan, has
asked the state Supreme Court to remove Blagojevich from office,
claiming he is unfit to serve. Madigan said Sunday she expects
word on whether the court will hear her request "probably just in
a few days."
</P>
<P>
Lisa Madigan is considered one of the top Democratic candidates
for governor in 2010.
</P>
<P>
The state constitution gives lawmakers broad authority to impeach
a governor for any reason they consider sufficient. The House
would decide whether to file charges against the governor, and
the Senate would ultimately rule on them.
</P>
<P>
Democrats first made the call for a special election, but some
are now having second thoughts.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Sen. Dick Durbin, for instance, was an early supporter, but
the Illinois Democrat is now calling for Blagojevich to resign so
that the lieutenant governor could appoint a senator.
</P>
<P>
Opponents of a special election cite the time and expense. It
would cost tens of millions of dollars and not produce a new
senator until April.
</P>
<P>
Republicans claim Democrats are wavering because they don't want
to risk a Republican candidate winning the special election.
