Basketball: Yao shines as Rockets rally to dump Wizards
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Yao Ming became forceful at the finish and Tracy McGrady scored
14 points in the last eight minutes, rallying Houston past
Washington 103-91 Friday with both stars showing no signs of
nagging injuries.
</P>
<P>
McGrady's hot shooting combined with a powerful slam dunk and key
jumper by Yao sparked a 27-6 Houston run over the final 8:30
minutes as the Rockets scored the last 13 points for the National
Basketball Association triumph.
</P>
<P>
"We had a very good eight minutes in the fourth quarter," Yao
said. "I'm not happy about the first three quarters. I'm not
happy about how we played. It was not too late for us to wake up
in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes it's too late. But not tonight."
</P>
<P>
The 28-year-old Chinese center missed Wednesday's loss to Dallas
with a sore left foot, the same foot he broke to miss the last 26
games of last season, but the 2.26m superstar said it was "no
problem" now.
</P>
<P>
Yao dominated Wizards rookie center JaVale McGee, forcing two-man
coverage from Washington that left McGrady open outside in the
closing minutes.
</P>
<P>
"Yao got really aggressive inside," Rockets coach Rick Adelman
said. "We always want him to get aggressive. Tonight it turned
the game around for us.
</P>
<P>
"He took it right at (McGee) and there was nothing he could do.
Somebody had to cover and Tracy got the hot hand."
</P>
<P>
McGrady, nursing a sore left knee, hit 5-of-6 shots in his
streak, four of them 3-pointers, to finish with 20 points.
</P>
<P>
"When we really needed a shot he hit it and that pumped us up
emotionally," Yao said.
</P>
<P>
Yao added 18 points while Ron Artest had 14 but reserves Aaron
Brooks, with 18 points, and Carl Landry, who scored 14 of his 19
in the second quarter, kept the Rockets within reach after they
fell behind 29-17 after the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
"It could have been a disaster," Adelman said. "I don't know what
happened. Suddenly we started making every shot. We had a nice
fourth quarter but we have to find a way to play 48 minutes."
</P>
<P>
Antawn Jamison led Washington with 27 points and 10 rebounds,
hitting 11 points in the third quarter to give the hosts a 77-70
lead entering the fourth.
</P>
<P>
"In the fourth quarter, we had seen enough," Yao said. "We didn't
want that to happen again."
</P>
<P>
The Wizards, who fell to 1-9, hit only 7-of-21 shots in the
fourth quarter and failed to score in the final 4:15.
</P>
<P>
"Yao got aggressive and the outside shooters started hitting,"
McGrady said. "We're a lock-down defensive team. When we need big
stops we have the guys who can make it happen."
</P>
<P>
The Rockets, 8-5, had Yao on the court for 33 minutes. That's
about how long Adelman would like to see his top scorer and
rebounder on the court until the foot pain Yao felt in a Monday
win over Oklahoma City is a more distant memory.
</P>
<P>
"We just have to monitor it and have him go out and play,"
Adelman said. "It seems to be fine now."
</P>
<P>
Houston's seventh victory in a row over the Wizards over the past
3 1/2 years extended Washington's losing streak this season to
four games.
</P>
<P>
Yao, taken by Houston with the first overall pick in the 2002 NBA
Draft, has been with the Rockets longer than any of his
teammates.
