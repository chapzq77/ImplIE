Basque militant arrested in France for alleged links to ETA
</HEADLINE>

An alleged member of the political arm of the Basque
independentist armed group ETA was arrested Tuesday in the
southwestern French city of Bayonne, a source close to the case
said.
</P>
<P>
French anti-terrorism police arrested 39-year-old Juliano
Cavaterra, a member of the Batasuna pro-independence party, at
his home and a search was underway.
</P>
<P>
Cavaterra is believed to be linked to the production and
distribution of ETA's internal newsletter Zutabe, a Spanish anti-
terrorism source told AFP.
</P>
<P>
A Batasuna spokesman in Spain expressed surprise at his arrest,
saying Cavaterra carried out his party activities "normally".
</P>
<P>
"He is part of Batasuna's international wing and is responsible
mostly for contacts with other independence movements around the
world," Jon Irazola told AFP.
</P>
<P>
Cavaterra had complained recently of being followed by police and
having his telephones bugged, Irazola added.
</P>
<P>
Batasuna is legal in France but was banned in Spain in 2003
because of its alleged links to ETA, which has killed 819 people
in four decades of armed struggle to achieve independence for the
Basque region of Spain.
</P>
<P>
France has pledged to help Spain in its clampdown against ETA
after the armed group called off a ceasefire in June that
shattered hopes of a peace settlement.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Francois Fillon met with his Spanish counterpart
Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero last month following a string of
arrests in France of suspected Basque militants.
</P>
<P>
Fillon said he believed ETA's infrastructure had been
"considerably reduced" in France as a result of such "decisive
acts."
</P>
<P>
ETA, which declared a ceasefire in March last year but violated
it on December 30 with a fatal bombing in Madrid, formally called
off its truce on June 5.
</P>
<P>
Since the end of the truce 18 suspected ETA members have been
arrested, including the armed groups logistics chief, and more
than 300 kilogrammes (661 pounds) of explosives have been seized.
</P>
<P>
Fourteen of the arrests were carried out in France, which has
long been used as a rear base by ETA.
