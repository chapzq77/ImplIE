MOVING UGGLA FROM NO. 2 IN LINEUP PAYING POWERFUL DIVIDENDS

MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. - Smartest lineup move the Marlins made this
year? Switching second baseman Dan Uggla from second in the
batting order to a place where he can worry less about getting on
base and swing away.
</P>
<P>
After he moved out of the second spot May 2 - he currently is
batting fifth - Uggla hit .439 with eight home runs and 17 RBI in
his next 12 games.
</P>
<P>
Uggla led the first-place Marlins in batting average (.316), home
runs (13) and RBI (31) as they began a three-game series with his
former club, the Arizona Diamondbacks, Tuesday at Dolphin
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
He also leads in strikeouts (44), less than ideal for the No. 2
spot, with its greater emphasis on setting the table rather than
clearing it.
</P>
<P>
"Up until this year, I wouldn't have believed it made any
difference," Uggla's father, John, said from home in Columbia,
Tenn. "He's always hit second. He gets more at-bats that way.
Last year they dropped him down for a few games and he didn't do
that well. But now, wow. The whole thing is kind of amazing to me
his power numbers are so good."
</P>
<P>
Dan Uggla himself isn't sold on the idea that batting order
matters that much - he points out he still hit 31 homers last
year.
</P>
<P>
"It hasn't changed my approach at all," Uggla said. "The only
thing it has done for me is it's given me more RBI opportunities,
hitting behind (Jeremy) Hermida, Hanley (Ramirez) and those guys.
There's a good chance those guys are going to be on base by the
time I get up there."
</P>
<P>
But the statistics suggest moving him down was the right thing.
His batting average has climbed from a lackluster .245 last
season. He is waiting for pitches he can punish and the team is
benefiting more when he does connect.
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if it's the lineup change, but he's been swinging
it pretty good," manager Fredi Gonzales said.
</P>
<P>
It's a wiser handling of a rarity at his position, a power guy at
second base. Uggla is on pace to become the first second baseman
to pound 80 or more extra-base hits in consecutive seasons since
Hall of Famer Rogers Hornsby in the 1920s.
</P>
<P>
Uggla, 28, has a higher slugging and on-base percentage than Jeff
Kent did at the same age, and Kent has been one of the archetypal
big-stick second baseman. This year, Uggla ranks in the top two
with Chase Utley in a slew of offensive power categories among
all second basemen.
</P>
<P>
The Diamondbacks didn't see that coming when they failed to
protect him on their roster in 2005. Facing his former team is
just a chance to see old friends, Uggla insists, downplaying the
idea he has any extra incentive to play well. At the same time,
there's an occasional hint he has not entirely forgotten the
history when the topic turns to his fielding.
</P>
<P>
"Shoot, I only made 11 errors last year," Uggla said. "I don't
think that's really considered a liability. That was supposed to
be my downfall, why the D'backs never really gave me a chance
because I couldn't play defense."
</P>
<P>
Actually, Uggla is right that he doesn't have much left to prove
to the Diamondbacks. The team that matters now is the Marlins.
</P>
<P>
The Marlins, who announced a long-term, $70 million deal with
shortstop Hanley Ramirez during the weekend, have signaled no
immediate plans to lock up other players. President of Baseball
Operations Larry Beinfest made no other recommendations for
multiyear deals, team owner Jeffrey Loria said.
</P>
<P>
Uggla is eligible for arbitration next year. His fielding (five
errors this season, tied for fifth-most at his position), his age
(four years older than Ramirez) and other factors all play into
the calculations.
</P>
<P>
The team will eventually have to decide whether to offer him a
multiyear deal or just go year to year until he's eligible for
free agency in a little more than three years. Certainly he's a
bargain now at $417,000.
</P>
<P>
The Marlins briefly considered moving Uggla to third base when
they traded Miguel Cabrera. The franchise has infield prospect
Chris Coghlan waiting in the wings. The long-term outlook depends
in part on the chemistry up the middle with Ramirez.
</P>
<P>
That chemistry can't always be measured in the score book. Uggla
admitted a "bonehead play" in the opener of the team's most
recent series, failing to cover second on what should have been a
double play.
</P>
<P>
Instead, it led to two unearned runs by Kansas City after a
double-clutching Ramirez botched a throw to first. At other
moments, the double-play tandem has worked more smoothly.
</P>
<P>
"As far as them offering any kind of long-term deal, that's
totally their call," Uggla said. "If they want to do it, great.
Obviously I love it down here. I love the guys. We'll just have
to wait to see what happens. It's too early to tell right now."
</P>
<P>
It is not too early to see one thing - moving Uggla down in the
batting order has helped the Marlins move up. And if he can keep
it up, he will make a powerful case that the Marlins should not
let him move on.
