Britain's Brown outlines sweeping constitutional reform by Phil
Hazlewood
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Prime Minister Gordon Brown proposed sweeping changes to the way
Britain is governed Tuesday, including moves towards a written
constitution and changing the way it decides on going to war.
</P>
<P>
Brown, who succeeded Tony Blair last week vowing a "new
government with new priorities", made a series of recommendations
to rebuild trust in government, increase power to parliament and
boost engagement in the democratic process.
</P>
<P>
"It is my hope that by working together for change in a spirit
that takes us beyond parties and beyond partisanship we can agree
a new British constitutional settlement that entrusts more power
to parliament and to the British people," he said, in his first
statement to parliament as prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Brown spoke of a "route map" to make those in power more
accountable and to uphold and enhance the rights and
responsibilities of the citizen in a move to counter opposition
claims he is a "top-down" centraliser.
</P>
<P>
Chief among the so-called "royal prerogatives" he wishes to
renounce is the power to declare war without parliamentary
consent, although lawmakers were allowed a vote on military
action in Iraq in 2003.
</P>
<P>
"For centuries they (the prime minister and executive) have
exercised authority in the name of the monarchy without the
people and their elected representatives being consulted," Brown
told parliament.
</P>
<P>
Such authority had "no place in a modern democracy", he said, and
by transferring the powers to parliament, it would make a "more
open 21st century British democracy which better serves the
British people".
</P>
<P>
"The government will now consult on a resolution to guarantee
that on the the grave issue of peace and war it is ultimately
this House of Commons which will make the decision," he said.
</P>
<P>
Brown also proposed greater transparency in the intelligence
services, with the creation of a new National Security Council
bringing together domestic and overseas security with development
and community relations.
</P>
<P>
To do so would send out a "clear message" that at all times
Britain "will be vigilant and we will never yield to addressing
the terrorist threat", he added.
</P>
<P>
It would also help "co-ordinate military, policing, intelligence
and diplomatic action and also to win hearts and minds in this
country and round the world".
</P>
<P>
But it was his proposal for a British bill of rights -- codifying
people's existing entitlements -- and/or a written constitution
for the first time in the country's history that is likely to
generate the most debate.
</P>
<P>
Unlike other countries, Britain's constitution as it stands is an
uncodified body of law and largely consists of written legal
precedents, international treaties, parliamentary conventions and
royal prerogatives.
</P>
<P>
Brown, who is keen to promote individual responsibility and a
sense of British identity, said the starting point should be the
country's shared values.
</P>
<P>
"There is a case that we should go further still than this
statement of values to codify, either in concordat or in a single
document, both the duties and rights of citizens and the balance
of power between government, parliament and the people," he
explained.
</P>
<P>
"In Britain we have a largely unwritten constitution. To change
this would represent a fundamental and historic shift in our
constitutional arrangement.
</P>
<P>
"So it is right to involve the public in a sustained debate
whether there is a case for the United Kingdom developing a full
British bill of rights and duties or for moving towards a written
constitution."
</P>
<P>
Brown outlined consultations would begin on all issues, but said
moves towards a constitution would only happen when there was a
"settled consensus" about whether it was wanted.
