Saudis considering plans to boost local employment: report
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Saudi officials are considering plans to raise the cost of hiring
foreign workers for the private sector in an effort to boost
employment levels, the country's deputy labour minister told the
Financial Times in an interview published Monday.
</P>
<P>
"It is an economic problem and it needs an economic solution,"
Abdulwahed al- Humaid told the business daily.
</P>
<P>
According to Humaid, the solution is "to increase the cost of
expatriate labour to make it comparable to the cost of the Saudi
worker."
</P>
<P>
Despite rising oil prices in recent years, Saudi unemployment has
risen from 9.7 percent to 12 percent since 2002, the FT said, and
there are 6.5 million foreign workers in the Middle Eastern
kingdom -- migrant workers willing to accept lower pay than young
Saudis.
</P>
<P>
In the long-term, the government's objective is to foster an
economic environment where the "Saudi worker becomes productive
so the economy becomes more competitive internationally," Humaid
said.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia already requires industries to employ a quota of
locals, and has increased the number of scholarships for Saudis
to study overseas, and is improving the public education system.
</P>
<P>
Humaid said he accepted that the reforms would be unpopular in
the private sector, commenting: "What we tell the private sector
(is): Saudis are not as bad as you try to portray them when you
provide them with a good working environment."
