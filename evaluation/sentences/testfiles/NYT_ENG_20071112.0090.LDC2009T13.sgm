SEX WORKERS FIGHT BACK AGAINST HIV

BOCA CHICA, Dominican Republic -- Saturday is date night in this
fading beach town where paunchy American men promenade down the
main drag at twilight, their arms draped proudly around lithe
young local girls.
</P>
<P>
As most of these couples literally don't speak the same language,
silence prevails over dinner before a night of intimacy that will
cost the men about $50.
</P>
<P>
The commercial sex trade that brings these couples together
throngs the streets, fills the restaurants, keeps occupancy up in
beach hotels during a slow season.
</P>
<P>
It is a buyer's market on this impoverished island where the
United States sends money to fight the HIV/AIDS epidemic, but
with strings to keep it from anyone who does not condemn
prostitution.
</P>
<P>
A woman who asks to be called Julia joined the girls lining the
street here as a teenager. She hoped to make her living as a
waitress, Julia says, but when that didn't cover food and rent,
she sold sex after her shifts ended.
</P>
<P>
"People come to the city with dreams and learn there is nothing
for them here," says Martha Butler de Lister, a physician and
former national AIDS director who now works in Santo Domingo with
charitable organizations. "They end up selling happiness."
</P>
<P>
Julia doesn't anymore, since she found out she has AIDS.
</P>
<P>
Vaguely worded policy
</P>
<P>
HAINA - Now Julia is back where she came from, in a turquoise-
painted shack covered with children's handprints in white paint,
where both sunlight and rain pour through gaps between boards
covering the roof.
</P>
<P>
She does not know what she would have done after her diagnosis,
she says, if it weren't for the women of Movimiento de Mujeres
Unido (Movement of United Women). It is an organization of sex
workers and former sex workers like her.
</P>
<P>
A woman named Jocelyn from MODEMU helps Julia get her medicine
and tells her she cannot work anymore.
</P>
<P>
That is only one way some of the people hit hardest by the virus
that leads to AIDS have taken a role in fighting the epidemic
here.
</P>
<P>
Organized sex workers also have taken to the front lines in a
search for solutions, participating in vaccine trials and
teaching condom use, with some support from drug companies,
nonprofit organizations and their government.
</P>
<P>
One source from which they don't get money, though, is the U.S.
President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, which sent $6.4
million to fight the epidemic here last year, but with
stipulations that preclude anyone who does not condemn sex work
from getting the money.
</P>
<P>
Critics of that policy say the pledge has caused organizations to
pull away from helping women who are both at the highest risk for
catching the virus and in the greatest need of support.
</P>
<P>
"It's widely misunderstood," U.S. global AIDS coordinator
Ambassador Mark Dybul responded recently.
</P>
<P>
While critics refer to the policy as an "anti-prostitution
pledge," Dybul says, the policy aims to help women by taking a
stand against a trade that he calls "damaging to gender
equality."
</P>
<P>
He adds that PEPFAR money supports 120 programs that provide care
and support services to women who are sex workers.
</P>
<P>
"There's a disconnect," Dybul says.
</P>
<P>
If there is, it works against vulnerable women, says Jodi
Jacobson of American Jewish World Services, an organization that
assists grass-roots groups and has turned down a U.S. faith-based
initiative grant rather than take the pledge. She added that the
policy is vaguely worded.
</P>
<P>
"There's a requirement that people sign and adopt a policy
opposing prostitution, whatever that might mean," Jacobson says.
"Also, there's a requirement that you not promote prostitution,
whatever that means."
</P>
<P>
The result, she says, has been that organizations shy away from
helping sex workers, fearing that it will cost them money.
</P>
<P>
"I would say Ambassador Dybul hasn't spoken to people affected
directly by the pledge."
</P>
<P>
Conjugal visits at penitentiary
</P>
<P>
SANTO DOMINGO - Beachfront hotels and flashing casino lights are
the fa?ade for a deeply divided and largely impoverished country,
human rights activists here have said, pointing to the bateyes,
former sugar cane plantations where imported Haitian laborers
toiled for several decades for little more than subsistence,
until even that money ran out.
</P>
<P>
Disparities are on display closer to the tourist destinations,
too, along the Malecon seafront strip and the dim streets
surrounding the colonial district where scores of streetwalkers
wait for customers, and in gas stations where teenagers hop into
cars driven by strangers.
</P>
<P>
Sex work is essentially legal here and institutionalized to the
point that a recent law requires that "cabanas" - hotels that
rent rooms by the hour - have two condoms in each room.
</P>
<P>
On the higher-priced end are bikini-clad women with dancers'
bodies who line up in the blink of disco lights at takeout
brothels behind pricey casino hotels. They will spend the night
with a customer for about $85.
</P>
<P>
On the more desperate end are women who visit the nearby
penitentiary, where HIV rates are estimated to be as much as five
times higher than those on the outside. There, Wednesdays and
Sundays are conjugal visiting days, when prisoners hang sheets
over their bunks and sex workers serve prisoners for about 150
pesos, less than $5. Some try to serve enough men to leave with
1,500 pesos.
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes they say they'll pay 100 pesos and then only pay
half," a childlike young woman said on a recent visiting day.
</P>
<P>
To make money during the rest of the week, many women who visit
the prison also work on the streets serving tourists, says Grace
Butler de Mejia, who runs Fundacion Genesis, which works with the
American nonprofit Health Through Walls to bring condoms to the
prison.
</P>
<P>
"This is an international problem," de Mejia says.
</P>
<P>
'Now there is no work'
</P>
<P>
DUQUESA - To understand how a woman can bring herself to such a
place, one must look at the alternatives, says Sonia Pierre, an
activist for the rights of Dominican women of Haitian descent.
</P>
<P>
"The women who do sexual work in jail come almost exclusively
from the bateyes," Pierre said recently. "More than 12 years ago,
the sugar companies began to pull out. Because now there is no
work, bateyes are places of women and children."
</P>
<P>
Ten minutes from the center of Santo Domingo, a garbage dump
replaced sugar cane fields as a source of livelihood for the
residents in Duquesa, a quarter-mile-long settlement off the road
to the new airport.
</P>
<P>
Here a series of philanthropic efforts turned a one-room
schoolhouse into two rooms. It still does not draw many children,
though, because they can better improve their immediate
existences by diving in the dump.
</P>
<P>
There - among rotting garbage, medical waste and industrial
chemicals, including battery acid and mercury - children find
toys and treasures in what other people throw away: a handful of
drinking straws, bits of metal, plastic and glass they can sell.
</P>
<P>
This is one of the better bateyes, says Pierre, who grew up in
one and organized her first protest about conditions there at the
age of 13. Bateyes around Haina and San Cristobal are worse, she
says.
</P>
<P>
Even for rural Dominicans not of Haitian descent and outside of
bateyes, life is hard, offering few opportunities for women who
struggle to support their families, Pierre stressed.
</P>
<P>
'Not for $200, not for $500!'
</P>
<P>
HAINA - By contrast, the rooms behind the Seaman Bar, where girls
have sex with sailors for prices running from $15 to $20, are a
haven, with roofs and running water.
</P>
<P>
The joking, squabbling and camaraderie of a girls' dormitory
prevail here, where women decorate their rooms with rosaries,
pictures of the Virgin Mary and snapshots of sailors.
</P>
<P>
Con suerte - with luck - they can make $500 a month, they say.
More often they earn less than half that. When only a few ships
dock, some make nothing at all.
</P>
<P>
Ships from around the world dock in this town in this industrial
port town, with a weekly manifest showing visits from Miami,
Savannah, Houston, New Orleans, as well as ports in Europe, South
America and Asia.
</P>
<P>
Some of the children of women who work here reflect this diverse
range of origins, with fathers from Haiti and the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Jocelyn, a mother of three with a beatific smile, points to her 9
-month-old son and says his father is from India.
</P>
<P>
A sex worker who also has recently found a niche in HIV
education, Jocelyn says she always uses condoms, except with the
fathers of her children.
</P>
<P>
Fellow sex workers watch her children for her when she travels to
nearby towns with a tote bag filled with condoms and an
anatomically correct model to roll them onto, showing other sex
workers how to insist on, or if necessary, cajole a thin layer of
protection.
</P>
<P>
"People will offer them $100 to have sex without a condom," she
says. "I tell them, 'No! Not for $200, not for $500!"'
</P>
<P>
The girls at the Seaman Bar can knock on her door at 1 o'clock in
the morning to get condoms, she says; she keeps big bags full of
them in the cramped, crowded two rooms across the street that she
shares with six other people.
</P>
<P>
She gets paid for outreach work during funded projects now but
stays in touch with the women whom she visits when she is not
getting paid. That way, she says, she won't have to start over
when she is called upon to look for new women to recruit for a
vaccine trial.
</P>
<P>
Jocelyn participated in one of the first trials for an anti-HIV
vaccine run by "Dr. Ellen" when her friend Juliana recruited her.
</P>
<P>
The trial gave her access to health care, vitamins and
information on how to avoid getting sexually transmitted
diseases, including HIV, she says. It also gave her a chance to
hit back at the epidemic that affects people she knows.
</P>
<P>
Now when she meets women who have the virus or need treatment for
other sexually transmitted infections, she sends them to Dr.
Ellen.
</P>
<P>
She kisses her fingers and raises them to the sky when she says,
"Dr. Ellen."
</P>
<P>
'It is their challenge'
</P>
<P>
SANTO DOMINGO - Dr. Ellen Koenig, who runs the Instituto
Dominicano de Estudios Virologicos, did not set out to be a
physician.
</P>
<P>
"The HIV epidemic made me a doctor," she says.
</P>
<P>
Koenig, an American who grew up in Delaware, had a degree in
microbiology when she married a Dominican, and he invited her to
join him "in paradise," she says.
</P>
<P>
"Then AIDS started."
</P>
<P>
One of her brothers, Dr. Jay Levy, was involved in the earliest
work to identify a virus. He suggested that she look for signs of
the illness on the island.
</P>
<P>
The blood samples she and a team of local university students
gathered later showed the virus was present in the Dominican
Republic in the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
Koenig began to diagnose people with HIV and, frustrated she
could do nothing to help them, went to medical school, completing
her degree in 1991 at the age of 50.
</P>
<P>
As new medicines to manage AIDS became available, though, only
the wealthiest patients could afford them.
</P>
<P>
"We lost a lot of patients because they didn't have the money,"
the doctor says. "The only way I could see out was clinical
trials."
</P>
<P>
The women of MODEMU were willing to help, Koenig says. Women
recruited through the group have since participated in a series
of vaccine trials.
</P>
<P>
"These are the heroines of today's epidemic. They realize it is
their challenge," Koenig says.
</P>
<P>
Like others who have faced the epidemic since its beginnings, she
believes a vaccine that either will prevent infection or keep the
virus from progressing is the best hope for containing HIV. Then,
she says, the women of MODEMU, who have continued to find
volunteers, will be proud.
</P>
<P>
"I keep telling them, you one day will say to your children, 'I
helped to make that vaccine possible."'
</P>
<P>
Talking 'equal to equal'
</P>
<P>
HAINA - In the meantime, stipends for recruiting and outreach
work allowed Jocelyn to buy a stove top, a refrigerator, a
television, a couch and two chairs for the crowded apartment
where two double beds were the only furniture for seven people.
</P>
<P>
Her friends say her career as a sex worker had slowed to the
point that she had not had a customer in four months.
</P>
<P>
Juliana, who through her work with MODEMU recruited some of
Koenig's first trial participants, lives with her two children in
a solid, tidy two-bedroom house decorated with religious regalia.
She says she is retired.
</P>
<P>
She socializes with active sex workers. On a recent visit to the
rooms behind the Seaman Bar, she rummaged pointedly through the
toiletries cluttering a friend's dresser and, with an expression
of satisfaction, held up a condom she found there.
</P>
<P>
She had a beer downstairs with a friend who still works the local
prison on visiting days and who fills her straw purse with
condoms to give other women working there. She, too, gets
stipends for outreach work through MODEMU.
</P>
<P>
With money from the government AIDS office, the group operates
locally now from a sparsely equipped office on a noisy corner in
the middle of Haina.
</P>
<P>
The office provides vocational and literacy training, as well as
outreach workers to connect HIV-infected women with services and
to make sure they know that they cannot work anymore.
</P>
<P>
"We talk with the women equal to equal to get across our message.
I say 'us' to a sex worker," Juliana says.
</P>
<P>
Many want a better life, she says, pointing to the response she
gets when she recruits for vaccine trials.
</P>
<P>
The future she and the others worry about stretches beyond their
immediate needs, she says.
</P>
<P>
"I have a daughter who is 15, and I'm afraid."
