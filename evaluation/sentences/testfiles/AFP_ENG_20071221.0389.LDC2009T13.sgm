Foreign mines in Zimbabwe can retain majority share: Mugabe
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Robert Mugabe said Friday that foreign mining firms who
invest in Zimbabwe would be allowed to retain majority stakes
under controversial ownership regulations.
</P>
<P>
"Where we read that a company has invested its profits over the
years, we will not demand majority shareholding but, of course,
we will need some shares," the state New Ziana news agency quoted
Mugabe as saying during a meeting with Zimbabwean ambassadors.
</P>
<P>
The veteran leader commended the Zimbabwe Platinum Company
(Zimplats) for building houses and roads, urging other companies
to take a cue from the firm, whose majority shareholder is South
Africa's Implats.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwe government plans to amend the Mines and Minerals Act
by inserting a clause providing for compulsory state acquisition
of 51 percent of all foreign- owned mining firms.
</P>
<P>
Under current laws, locals are entitled to a 15 percent stake in
foreign-owned mining ventures, but there have been few takers.
</P>
<P>
The Chamber of Mines, representing 200 mining houses in Zimbabwe,
warned last year that the proposed amendments would effectively
kill off investment needed to keep the mines open.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe is in the throes of an economic crisis, with inflation
nearly 8,000-percent, and severe shortages of fuel and food.
</P>
<P>
In June last year during a tour of Zimplats, Mugabe stressed that
the new ownership rules would not apply across the board.
</P>
<P>
New Ziana said Mugabe expressed concern that the mining sector
was reporting a decline in production and consequently in foreign
currency earnings and yet mining operations were continuing.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe also lashed out at some black managers of large
manufacturing companies, accusing them of frustrating government
efforts to revive the econony.
</P>
<P>
"Most of these firms are run by our brothers and sisters and they
are arrogant," he said
</P>
<P>
"We have created a middle class of people that look down on the
people in government. It is sad," he said.
