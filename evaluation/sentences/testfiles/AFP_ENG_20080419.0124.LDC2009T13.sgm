South Korea open to 'results' summit with North Korea
</HEADLINE>

South Korean leader Lee Myung-bak said on Saturday that he was
open to holding a summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong-Il if
the talks would yield results."I will agree to it when the need
is real and I already said publicly that I am willing to meet
with him not just once, but many times but if the meeting will
yield substantial and real results," Lee said during a news
conference at  the US presidential retreat in Camp David,
Maryland.

<P>
"I believe only when that is possible I am ready to meet with him
and have a sensible dialogue, because that will help to bring
about peace and stability in the peninsula," he said.
</P>
<P>
However he added: "I'm not suggesting that to have a meeting with
chairman Kim anytime soon. If the need arises, again, I'm ready
to meet with him."
</P>
<P>
Kim said in the interests of holding ongoing dialogue "based on
genuine cooperation and sincerity" with North Korea, he "thought
it would be helpful to set up a permanent liaison office in both
Seoul and Pyongyang."

Kim and President George W. Bush spoke to reporters at the end of
their two-day summit designed to promote a huge free trade pact
and plans to dismantle North Korea's nuclear programs.
</P>
<P>
The summit was set to focus on the six-country talks aimed at
ending North Korea's nuclear weapons drive, with the White House
seemingly bending backwards in hopes of a breakthrough before
Bush leaves office in January 2009.

<P>
"Of course, I mean, they may be trying to stall," Bush said. "One
thing about a nontransparent society where there's not a lot of
free press, for example, or a lot of opposition voices, it's hard
to tell what's going on.
</P>
<P>
"So if it there ever is going to be a breakthrough, it will be
through the six- party framework."
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, the North Korean leader hailed his troops as
"invincible" amid a war of words and growing tensions with South
Korea.
</P>
<P>
The two countries are still technically at war since the
1950-1953 Korean conflict ended only in a fragile armistice.
