Danish police on Thursday arrested 13 members of rival gangs
wanted for drug trafficking, seizing arms and large amounts of
cash, police said.

"More than 100 police officers took part in the operation
following an investigation into a violent shooting in December
between two groups involved in drug trafficking," Bent Isager-
Nielsen, police inspector at Albertslund west of Copenhagen, told
AFP.

Those detained -- 12 men and a woman aged between 19 and 32, are
of Iraqi, Lebanese, Moroccan, Pakistani, Somali and Turkish
origin but have Danish citizenship.

They were charged with attempted murder and violating Denmark's
legislation on the use of firearms.

In a massive shootout on December 11, "at least 88 bullets were
fired from nine different weapons" between the two gangs in the
Taastrup neighbourhood, 25 kilometres (15 miles) west of the
Danish capital, but no one was hurt, said Isager-Nielsen.

On Thursday police seized firearms, bullet-proof vests and

cocaine market.
