Tennis: Nalbandian crushes Nadal to win Paris Masters
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
David Nalbandian of Argentina handed out a tennis lesson to world
No.2 Rafael Nadal to win his second straight Masters Series title
here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Argentinian won at a canter 6-4, 6-0 taking nine games in a
row from 3-4 down in the first set against an increasingly
disillusioned-looking Spaniard, who has been struggling with his
fitness since the summer.
</P>
<P>
It was Nalbandian's second straight win in one of the Masters
Series tournaments having defeated world No.1 Roger Federer in
the final of the Madrid Masters last month.
</P>
<P>
He also defeated Federer in Paris at the third round (last 16)
stage, but unless someone withdraws through injury he will not be
able to compete in the Masters Series finals in Shanghai later
this month.
</P>
<P>
The win in Paris hoists him to ninth in the ATP Masters Series
race, but only eight players qualify.
</P>
<P>
"I played magnificently all week and in Madrid and I am so
happy," said Nalbandian, who has hit a rich vein of form in
recent weeks after what had been for him a disappointing season.
</P>
<P>
In Madrid, he defeated the top three players in the world -
Federer, Nadal and Djokovic and in Paris he once again despatched
the top two - Federer and Nadal.
</P>
<P>
The former world No.3 lost only one set in Paris - to Spain's
David Ferrer in the quarter-finals.
</P>
<P>
For Nadal, it was the end to a 25-match winning streak in Paris
taking in three French Open titles and his four wins here to get
to the final.
</P>
<P>
But he will be seeded two behind Federer in Shanghai which starts
on November 12.
