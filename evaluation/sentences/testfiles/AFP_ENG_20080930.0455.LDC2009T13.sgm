US envoy en route to NKorea in bid to save nuclear deal
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
US negotiator Christopher Hill arrived Tuesday in Seoul and will
travel on to Pyongyang in an attempt to save a North Korean
nuclear disarmament deal that appears close to collapse.
</P>
<P>
Hill leaves for the communist state Wednesday at the invitation
of its leaders, in a bid to settle an intractable dispute about
verification of the North's nuclear disclosures.
</P>
<P>
"Let's see if we can make some progress on this," he told
reporters at Incheon airport west of Seoul.
</P>
<P>
Hill said the US and North Koreans had had some discussions
through the North's UN mission in New York to try to resolve the
dispute.
</P>
<P>
"We thought it would be useful to try to have those discussions
in Pyongyang. That's why I'm going."
</P>
<P>
The nuclear envoy reiterated that Washington is ready to remove
Pyongyang from a terrorism blacklist when verification procedures
are agreed.
</P>
<P>
"Let's see if we can come up with measures that will allow us to
verify their declaration," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We also want to move on to complete our obligations in phase
two, which include of course to take them off the terrorism
list."
</P>
<P>
The United States and its partners are alarmed that a hard-won,
six-nation disarmament agreement reached in February 2007 is
crumbling away.
</P>
<P>
The aid-for-disarmament deal has hit several roadblocks before
but this latest dispute is seen as the most serious.
</P>
<P>
The North accuses Washington of breaking the pact by failing to
remove it from a terrorism blacklist in return for its work to
disable a nuclear complex and the delivery of the declaration.
</P>
<P>
It announced last week it would begin restarting a plutonium
reprocessing plant within a week and ordered UN atomic inspectors
to quit the building at Yongbyon.
</P>
<P>
The North, which tested an atomic weapon in October 2006, is
estimated to have produced enough plutonium for around six bombs
before Yongbyon was shut down last year under the pact.
</P>
<P>
Analysts believe it could produce enough material for one more
bomb if it resumes reprocessing of spent reactor fuel rods.
