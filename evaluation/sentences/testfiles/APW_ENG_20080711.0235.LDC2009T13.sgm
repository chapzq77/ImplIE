The frozen remains of two woolly mammoths -- long extinct Ice Age
elephants -- went on display Friday in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
One specimen nicknamed "Oymiakon" -- believed to be a 1-year-old
female that lived between 28,000 B.C. and 38,000 B.C. -- was
being shown outside Russia for the first time since its discovery
in the Siberian permafrost in 2004, organizers said.

<P>
Only her tusk-less head was uncovered, and the rest of the
remains may have decomposed or were eaten by other animals, said
zoologist Lin Chun-tsong.
</P>
<P>
The second mammoth, called "Yukagir," a 40-year-old male that
lived around 18,000 B.C., is complete with two long curving
tusks, hairy head and part of a leg. It was first seen by the
public at Japan's Aichi Expo in 2005, after being excavated in
2002.
</P>
<P>
Some experts believe the mammoths were discovered because of
Siberia's melting permafrost, said Hsiang Kuo-ning, director of
the United Evening News, which co-sponsors the exhibition.
</P>
<P>
The mammoth remains were provided by Russia's Sakha Republic,
where they were discovered. The exhibition will run through Nov.
4.
