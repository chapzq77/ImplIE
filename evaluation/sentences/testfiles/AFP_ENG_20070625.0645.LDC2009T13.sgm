Muggle world awaits Potter's latest film by Harumi Ozawa

<P>
The latest movie on the world's most famous wizard, "Harry Potter
and the Order of the Phoenix," hits the screen here Thursday,
just weeks before fans will at last learn his final fate.
</P>
<P>
The modest, bespectacled wizard has charmed a wide range of
Muggles -- nonmagical humans -- from children avid to join
Harry's Dumbledore's Army to Guantanamo Bay inmates who are
reportedly entranced with the Potter series.
</P>
<P>
British writer J.K. Rowling's six Harry Potter books have sold
325 million copies worldwide and have been translated into 64
languages, with the series converted into a successful film
franchise starring Daniel Radcliffe.
</P>
<P>
The earnestly awaited seventh and final book, "Harry Potter and
the Deathly Hallows," is to be released on July 21, with Rowling
warning she will kill off two characters.
</P>
<P>
But on the screen, fans' worries about Harry's fate will be
delayed for the time being as "Harry Potter and the Order of the
Phoenix," the fifth installment, opens in Tokyo in a world
premiere on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The huge 150 million-dollar production follows Harry and his
classmates at the Hogwarts school -- such as Ron Weasley and
Hermione Granger -- as they face the evil Lord Voldemort who has
come back from the darkness.
</P>
<P>
The latest film on Harry, literally the golden boy of Warner
Brothers Entertainment, is the first to be directed by David
Yates.
</P>
<P>
Yates, who has built the career with television dramas like "Sex
Traffic," said he was challenged to depict the boy wizard who was
now 15 and struggling with his inner self and ego.
</P>
<P>
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix" is "more complicated
and complex than the earlier films," Yates told Japan's Fuji
Television Network.
</P>
<P>
"The key things of this movie are really about identity, about
discovering who you are as a person, at that very difficult and
often dramatic age between about 14 and 17," Yates said.
</P>
<P>
"So it kind of opens the movies up to a bigger, older audience in
a way, I think," he said.
</P>
<P>
Harry also experiences his first romance in the fifth
installment, a highlight of the upcoming film especially for
those who have watched the life of the poor boy, whose parents
were killed by Voldemort and was adopted by his mean aunt and
uncle.
</P>
<P>
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix" will come with a
major promotional campaign, with Harry's alter ego Radcliffe and
producer David Heyman coming to Japan for the gala premiere.
</P>
<P>
The film will hit cinemas around the world starting on July 11.
It will not go into general release in Japan until July 20.
</P>
<P>
It is the latest Hollywood film to have its world premiere in
Japan, with "Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End" starring
Johnny Depp also opening here before other countries.
</P>
<P>
While Japanese films are gaining strength in the world's second
largest box office, with domestic fare overtaking Hollywood last
year for the first time in 20 years, wizard and pirate adventure
fantasies still remained the most profitable of all.
</P>
<P>
The fourth installment, "Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,"
was last year's top-grossing film in Japan, earning 11 billion
yen (92.5 million dollars), edging out "Pirates of the Caribbean:
Dead Man's Chest."
