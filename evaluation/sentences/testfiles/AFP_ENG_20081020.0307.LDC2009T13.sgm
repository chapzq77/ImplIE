1,500 jobless as another China factory shuts: report
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hong Kong-listed appliance maker shut its southern China factory
on Monday, state media reported, making it the latest victim of
the world economic slowdown's impact on Chinese manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
The closure of Bailingda Industrial Co.'s electrical appliance
factory in the export hub of Shenzhen has left 1,500 employees
jobless, Xinhua news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
It follows the failure on Friday of another Hong Kong-listed
firm, toymaker Smart Union, which shut its factory in the nearby
city of Dongguan in Guangdong province, throwing about 7,000 out
of work.
</P>
<P>
The situation has highlighted the growing risk of instability in
China's coastal manufacturing hubs as factories face financial
difficulties leading to large- scale layoffs.
</P>
<P>
Xinhua said more than 1,000 of the laid-off Bailingda employees
had gathered outside the factory on Sunday, demanding government
intervention to secure unpaid wages.
</P>
<P>
The report made no mention of any disturbances.
</P>
<P>
It said worried Guangdong labour authorities were considering
setting up a fund to help workers laid off by factory closures.
</P>
<P>
Smart Union owes its workers at least six weeks' wages each, Hong
Kong's South China Morning Post newspaper has reported, citing a
company employee.
</P>
<P>
The Smart Union workers crowded around the factory's gates last
week seeking news of their jobs and unpaid salaries, prompting
the local government to warn them against escalating their
action.
</P>
<P>
Experts have warned of increasing pain in China's coastal
manufacturing regions due to the world economic crisis,
particularly in the main export markets of the United States and
Europe.
</P>
<P>
Rising labour and raw materials costs and the appreciation of
China's yuan currency, which makes Chinese-made goods more
expensive overseas, are also seen as factors.
</P>
<P>
Chinese state press reported last week that more than half of the
nation's toy exporters -- about 3,631 enterprises -- had gone
belly up in 2008.
</P>
<P>
China's economy is heavily dependent on overseas demand for its
cheap manufactured goods. The factories that make them provide
work for tens of millions of poor Chinese.
