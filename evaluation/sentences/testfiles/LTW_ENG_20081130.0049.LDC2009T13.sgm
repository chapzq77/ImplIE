Joint Chiefs Chairman `Very Postitive' After Meeting with Obama
</HEADLINE>

Adm. Michael Mullen, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
went unarmed into his first meeting with the new commander in
chief -- no aides, no PowerPoint presentation, no briefing books.
Summoned nine days ago to President-elect Barack Obama's Chicago
transition office, Mullen showed up with just a pad, a pen and a
desire to take the measure of his incoming boss.

There was little talk of exiting Iraq or beefing up the U.S.
force in Afghanistan; the one-on-one, 45-minute conversation
ranged from the personal to the philosophical. Mullen came away
with what he wanted: a view of the next president as a non-
ideological pragmatist who was willing to both listen and lead.
After the meeting, the chairman "felt very good, very positive,"
according to Mullen spokesman Capt. John Kirby.

As Obama prepares to announce his national security team Monday,
he faces a military that has long mistrusted Democrats and is
particularly wary of a young, intellectual leader with no
experience in uniform, who once called Iraq a "dumb" war.
Military leaders have all heard his pledge to withdraw most
combat forces from Iraq within 16 months -- sooner than
commanders on the ground have recommended -- and his implied
criticism of the Afghanistan war effort during the Bush
administration.
