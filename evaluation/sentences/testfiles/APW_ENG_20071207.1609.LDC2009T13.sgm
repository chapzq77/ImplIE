The former leader of the Alaska House of Representatives was
sentenced to six years in a federal prison Friday for accepting
$9,000 (euro6,143) in bribes from the founder of an oil field
services company.
</P>
<P>
The case against Pete Kott wide implications because the FBI is
investigating whether Ted Stevens, the U.S. Senate's longest-
serving Republican, received illegal gifts from the head of the
company, VECO Corp. Stevens has not been charged and has denied
wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
Kott was convicted in September of bribery, extortion and
conspiracy and acquitted of wire fraud. Besides the cash, federal
prosecutors said the Republican former Speaker of the House
accepted a political poll paid on his behalf by VECO and that he
received the promise of a job with the company after he left the
Alaska Legislature.

<P>
A key witness in Kott's trial was VECO founder and former CEO
Bill Allen, who along with a company vice president, Rick Smith,
has pleaded guilty to bribing Kott and other lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
Kott's two-week trial included testimony by Allen that he doled
out more than $400,000 (euro273,056) in bribes to various
officials and had company workers remodel the home of Stevens.
Stevens has said he paid all bills he received for the remodeling
project.
</P>
<P>
VECO stood to make millions in contracts if the state Legislature
approved a revised crude oil tax that encouraged investment. The
Legislature passed the tax, but has rewritten the law since
Kott's conviction.
