No Indonesians involve in Horta assassination attempt: spokesman
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

JAKARTA, April 21 (Xinhua)
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian government has no evidence linking its citizens
with an assassination attempt against Timor Leste President Jose
Ramos-Horta, The Jakarta Post newspaper quoted a spokesman as
reporting on Monday.
</P>
<P>
There was no evidence indicating a role of any Indonesian
individuals in the February 11 attempt, Dino Patti Djalal,
spokesman for President Susilo bambang Yudhoyono, said the
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
"Based on evidence we have collected so far, there are no
Indonesian citizens involved in the assassination attempt," he
told English-language daily.
</P>
<P>
Dino was responding to Horta's allegations that Indonesia's
private broadcaster MetroTV and officials of East Nusa Tenggara
province had facilitated Maj. Alfredo Reinado's travel to Jakarta
with false documents ahead of the assassination attempt.
</P>
<P>
Horta accused Metro TV of helping fugitive rebel Reinado visit
Jakarta for an interview in May 2007.
</P>
<P>
Reinado was killed in one of two simultaneous attacks on Feb. 11
which targeted both Horta and Timor Leste Prime Minister Xanana
Gusmao.
</P>
<P>
He specifically accused Metro TV journalist Desi Anwar, who he
said organized the interview, of breaching a fundamental code of
ethics and violating Timor Leste's law.
</P>
<P>
Horta said Metro TV and other Indonesian elements' actions
contributed to the assassination attempt and that he could not
rest until the truth of their involvement with Reinado was
uncovered.
</P>
<P>
MetroTV dismissed all accusations against it and Desi.
</P>
<P>
"It is not true at all. We are a TV station, not an institution
to issue documents. What we do is just interviewing, and
broadcasting, nothing else," Metro TV deputy chief editor Makroen
Sanjaya said.
</P>
<P>
Dino, too, rejected any possible involvement of Desi and Metro
TV, saying such an interview did not mean they helped Reinado.
</P>
<P>
"Journalists can interview anyone. But that does not mean they
gave help. Unless we have strong evidence, we can't say anyone
was involved," Dino said.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, President Susilo said he was surprised at the reports.
</P>
<P>
He said Timor Leste leaders should not issue any statement to
insinuate involvement on the part of Indonesia, which may cause
confusion or misinterpretation by the international community and
for the Indonesian people, and disrupt both countries' bilateral
relations.
