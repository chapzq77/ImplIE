McCain Stumps in Hampton Roads
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sen. John McCain and his running mate, Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin,
rallied thousands of enthusiastic supporters Monday in Hampton
Roads, an increasingly crucial region in Virginia that had once
been considered safe territory for the Republican presidential
ticket but is now up for grabs.
</P>
<P>
McCain, R-Ariz., came to the heavily populated and racially
diverse area to speak about the global economic crisis, U.S.
troops serving in Iraq and Afghanistan, and his increasingly
uphill battle to the presidency.
</P>
<P>
"Let me give you the state of the race today and some straight
talk," McCain said. "We have 22 days to go. We're six points
down. The national media has written us off. But they forgot to
let you decide."
</P>
<P>
Monday's visit, three weeks before the Nov. 4 election, shows
that the McCain campaign recognizes the area's importance to
winning Virginia's 13 electoral votes. It also demonstrates that
the region, like the state as a whole, can no longer be
considered a Republican stronghold.
</P>
<P>
The area, home to the world's largest naval base, will be one of
the state's most competitive in the presidential race. A
Washington Post-ABC News poll late last month showed that 50
percent of likely voters in Hampton Roads favor the Democratic
nominee, Sen. Barack Obama, D-Ill., and 45 percent back McCain.
</P>
<P>
"It's going to come right down to the wire here, and it's pretty
clear that the road to victory in 2008 is going to run right
through the Hampton Roads," Palin said.
</P>
<P>
Democrats expect Obama to win big in vote-rich Northern Virginia,
while Republicans expect McCain to win the Shenandoah Valley and
rural Southside and southwestern Virginia. That means winning the
state could come down to Hampton Roads.
</P>
<P>
The region is home to core constituencies for both parties. It is
composed of mid-size cities and sprawling suburbs where economic,
military and social issues all come into play.
</P>
<P>
McCain, a Navy veteran who was once based at Naval Air Station
Oceana in Virginia Beach, expects support from the half-million
people connected with the military as well as the large
evangelical population. Obama, the first black presidential
nominee on a major party ticket, expects support from the state's
largest African-American population and thousands of college
students.
</P>
<P>
"It's ground zero. It comes down to Hampton Roads," said state
Del. John Cosgrove, R-Chesapeake, who was working as a volunteer
at the rally. "You can't look at Hampton Roads and say, `This is
a Republican area and that is a Democratic area,' because it
really is a mix."
</P>
<P>
The Virginia Beach Convention Center was filled with thousands of
supporters wearing red shirts, sweaters, scarves and hats to
symbolize their desire to prevent a Democrat from carrying the
state for the first time in more than four decades.
</P>
<P>
The McCain campaign estimated the crowd at 25,000 people, but the
local police and fire marshal put it closer to 12,000.
</P>
<P>
Supporters waved "Country First" signs and handmade posters with
the words "I Have 4 Hockey Moms and 1 Joe Six Pack for McCain-
Palin" and "Trig for First Baby," referring to Palin's youngest
son. Palin, by far, received the most cheers. "Sar-ah!" they
chanted. "Sar-ah!"
</P>
<P>
Hampton Roads, a sprawling area of 1.6 million people in 17
localities, includes the state's second-largest metropolitan area
and largest city. Virginia's southeastern corner has been a swing
area in recent years, veering back and forth between Republicans
and Democrats.
</P>
<P>
Republican Attorney General Robert McDonnell, who spoke at the
rally, said he thinks McCain will win Hampton Roads, but he added
that it was important for McCain to come to the area anyway to
shore up the base.
</P>
<P>
"You have to energize your team," said McDonnell, who was wearing
a red tie. "You certainly don't want to take any part of the
state for granted."
</P>
<P>
It was McCain's second trip to the battleground state since the
Feb. 12 primary. Later Monday, Palin attended a rally of about
25,000 at the Richmond International Raceway.
</P>
<P>
Obama has been to Virginia six times since securing the
Democratic presidential nomination. His running mate, Sen. Joe
Biden, D-Del., and their wives have been to the state a total of
eight times. Five of the 14 trips were to Hampton Roads.
</P>
<P>
No Democratic presidential candidate has carried Virginia since
1964, but recent polls show Obama and McCain locked in an
extremely competitive race in Virginia. The Post-ABC News poll
late last month indicated that Virginia's likely voters are
divided 49 percent for Obama and 46 percent for McCain.
</P>
<P>
In response to McCain's visit, Obama's campaign held news
conferences in Virginia Beach and Richmond, where Virginia
veterans spoke of their concerns about McCain.
</P>
<P>
State Del. Joseph Bouchard, D-Virginia Beach , who spent almost
three decades in the Navy, said demographic changes combined with
discontent over Bush's veterans benefits policies have soured
residents on McCain.
</P>
<P>
"They feel the Bush administration has let them down," he said.
"McCain has been in lockstep with Bush."
