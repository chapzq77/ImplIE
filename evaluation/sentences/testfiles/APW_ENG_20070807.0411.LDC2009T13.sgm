Reports: Trials start in Shanghai fund scandal that brought down
city ' s top official

BEIJING 2007-08-07 08:17:52 UTC

<P>
Trials have begun in a wide-ranging pension fund scandal in
China's business hub of Shanghai that felled the city's top
official, a magazine reported.
</P>
<P>
Seven people have been indicted in Shanghai, with the trial of
Wang Guoxiong, a manager with a city government investment arm,
among those already under way, the highly regarded business
weekly Caijing reported in its edition published Monday.
</P>
<P>
Others face trials in the neighboring province of Anhui and the
northern province of Jilin, where 14 officials and state industry
managers are under indictment, including the head of Shanghai's
social security bureau, it said.
</P>
<P>
It wasn't immediately clear why those cases were being heard in
Jilin, north of the capital Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The highest official to fall in the case was Shanghai's powerful
Communist Party secretary Chen Liangyu, who is reportedly in jail
awaiting trial on corruption charges. Authorities announced last
month that Chen had been kicked out of the party and removed from
all government positions.
</P>
<P>
Authorities have kept a tight lid on information about the
scandal investigation, although the recent revelations seem to
indicate it could be nearing a conclusion.
</P>
<P>
The party is believed to want to wrap up those cases ahead of its
twice-a-decade congress sometime later this year, at which
president and party chief Hu Jintao will try to further entrench
his rule and set the political and social agenda for the next
five years.
</P>
<P>
The scandal investigation and Chen's dismissal have been widely
viewed as part of Hu's efforts to shove aside supporters of
former party boss Jiang Zemin, whose political base was Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Chen, who had also been a member of the party's 24-seat
Politburo, was among Jiang's most powerful allies. He is the
highest-level Chinese official to be dismissed in a decade and is
accused of being at the center of the high-profile scandal in
which US$400 million (euro290 million) in pension funds were
improperly invested in real estate and road toll projects.
</P>
<P>
Dozens have been questioned or detained in the scandal, including
Wang Weigong, a former secretary to Huang Ju, a member of the
all-powerful nine-member Politburo Standing Committee who died of
cancer in June.
</P>
<P>
Wang has been suspended from his current job at a government
power company for "severe discipline violations," a Shanghai
government spokeswoman said on routine condition of anonymity.
She said the investigation into Wang was continuing but gave no
other details.
</P>
<P>
Huang had served as the disgraced Chen's predecessor as both
Shanghai mayor and party secretary, during which time he was
assisted by Wang. Questions have been raised in past about
Huang's possible involvement in the pension scandal, although no
charges have ever been made.
