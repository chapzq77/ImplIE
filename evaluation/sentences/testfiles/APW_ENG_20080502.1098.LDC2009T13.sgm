Tesla high-powered electric car sends sparks through industry as
it hits market

<P>
It is safe to say Jeremy Snyder gets a charge out of the two-seat
Tesla Roadster whenever he pulls one off the lot -- and not
because it's equipped with an all-electric engine.
</P>
<P>
As he pulled one of the sleek new automobiles down a side street
Thursday and put the pedal to the metal, its lithium-ion battery-
powered engine didn't give off sparks. It just emitted a powerful
hum, something like a much quieter version of a jet taking off.
</P>
<P>
"Accelerate pretty good?" asked Snyder, head of client services
for Tesla, who knew the answer.
</P>
<P>
"I call it a turbine sound," he said of the sound. "Because it's
an electric motor it's got 100 percent torque all the time. So it
just pulls you like when you're taking off in an airplane."
</P>
<P>
After several years of development, the Roadster -- with sleek
lines like a Ferrari or Porsche and a sticker price of $109,000
(euro70,513) -- officially moves from the drawing boards to the
market next week when Tesla's first store opens. It's near the
University of California, Los Angeles, in the city's toney
Westwood neighborhood where Beverly Hills, Brentwood and
Hollywood practically intersect.
</P>
<P>
"Because it's Hollywood and glamorous, this is the flagship
store," Snyder said.
</P>
<P>
The next store is to open in a couple months near Tesla's
headquarters in the Silicon Valley city of San Carlos, where the
car was developed with venture capital of more than $40 million
(euro26 million) from such investors as Google Inc. founders
Larry Page and Sergey Brin. More stores are planned for Chicago,
New York and other cities by early next year.
</P>
<P>
Although a fully loaded model can set a buyer back as much as
$124,000 (euro80,217), that's still cheap compared with a high-
end Ferrari. And its 6,831-cell lithium-ion battery pack gives
off no emissions.
</P>
<P>
The car goes from 0 to 60 mph (100 kph) in just under four
seconds and tops out at 125 mph (200 kph). It goes 225 miles (362
kilometers) on one charge and can be fully recharged in 3.5
hours, which Tesla officials say should allow most people to
drive it to work and back and recharge it at night like a cell
phone.
</P>
<P>
Driving from Los Angeles to San Francisco, however, would require
stopping in, say, Fresno and plugging its adapter cord into a
motel room wall socket.
</P>
<P>
Some critics have expressed concerns about the durability and
safety of the lithium-ion battery, which weighs about 1,000
pounds (453 kilograms), more than a third of the entire weight of
the 2,700-pound Roadster, whose body is made up of carbon fiber
materials. Tesla officials respond that the car has passed all
required safety tests. They say the battery should last for about
100,000 miles (160,000 kilometers) of driving.
</P>
<P>
The company, formed in 2003, is named for inventor Nikola Tesla,
an early pioneer in the field of electricity. The people buying
its cars so far, said national sales manager Doreen Allen, are
celebrities, early adopters, wealthy people and
environmentalists.
</P>
<P>
Tesla officials say Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, actors George
Clooney and Kelsey Grammer and musicians Will.i.am and Flea have
each ordered a Roadster.
</P>
<P>
It will be awhile before anyone can walk in and drive a Tesla
home off a lot, however.
</P>
<P>
"Delivery is running about 15 months," Allen said, adding the
company was surprised by the demand.
</P>
<P>
Tesla began taking orders last year for the 600 Roadsters it
planned to produce in 2008 and had sold all of them by October,
Allen said. The first ones began rolling off the production line
six weeks ago, and Allen said all of the 2008 models should be
delivered to their owners by March of next year. The first ones
should begin going out the door later this month.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, orders are being taken for 2009 models, with plans
calling for production of about 1,500 cars.
</P>
<P>
Eventually Tesla also plans to produce cheaper, family vehicles.
</P>
<P>
"There's a model in the works right now, a five-passenger sedan
that will be styled comparable to the roadster but a lot roomier
to accommodate families, and that is slated for 2010," Snyder
said.
