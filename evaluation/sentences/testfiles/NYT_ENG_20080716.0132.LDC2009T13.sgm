WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. -- "Mamma Mia!" never was anyone's idea of
a well-constructed stage show, but its good-time disco music by
Swedish pop band ABBA was enough to turn it into a global hit.
</P>
<P>
Its weaknesses survive, and the show's cheesy plot and badly
matched score only look worse blown up onto the silver screen.
Still, no amount of critical naysaying seems likely to dampen the
success of this clumsy transfer to celluloid.
</P>
<P>
Meryl Streep stars as Donna, a single mom and former girl group
singer, who now runs a hotel on a tiny Greek island. Her 21-year-
old daughter Sophie (fresh-scrubbed Amanda Seyfried) is about to
be married, but she does not know who her dad is. And neither
does Donna.
</P>
<P>
Sophie finds out about three possible sperm donors by reading her
mother's old diary, so she invites all of them to the wedding,
expecting to spot her father on sight. Yes, the story has more
than a passing resemblance to 1968's "Buona Sera, Mrs. Campbell,"
but you will never get "Mamma Mia!'s" creators to acknowledge the
similarities.
</P>
<P>
The show's director, Phyllida Lloyd, makes her film debut,
showing less aptitude for camera movement than "The Producers"'
Susan Stroman. Nor is she helped by her cinematographer or
editor, and rookie screenwriter Catherine Johnson adds a bit to
her stage script, where less would have been more. The movie only
works if you get into the giddy fun of such buoyant, bass-heavy
numbers as "Dancing Queen," "Money, Money, Money" and the title
song.
</P>
<P>
Those who know Streep's stage resume should not be surprised that
she has a very musical voice, as does Christine Baranski, as one
of Donna's backup singer pals. But you will never believe that
either Colin Firth or Stellen Skarsgard was asked about their
vocal chops before they were cast, and Pierce Brosnan is even
more painful in the warbling department. Whatever happened to
dubbing in real singers?
