France suspends use of type of cancer radiotherapy machines after
malfunctions reported

A series of problems with radiation machines used to treat brain
cancer sufferers -- with malfunctioning machines and some
patients receiving overdoses -- is raising questions around
France about the safety of the treatment.
</P>
<P>
The Health Ministry this week ordered half the country's brain
tumor radiotherapy machines suspended indefinitely following a
warning from the manufacturer, Brainlab, that they were not
targeting properly.
</P>
<P>
Some 550 similar machines from the company, based in Munich,
Germany, are in use worldwide -- the largest number of them in
the United States, according to Brainlab founder and chief
executive officer Stefan Vilsmeier. He said the problem stems
from a rare combination of components and is only believed to
affect seven of the machines: four in France, two in the United
States and one in Spain.
</P>
<P>
He would not name the hospitals outside France involved, but said
they and government health authorities in the U.S. and Spain had
been contacted, and that Brainlab was leaving it up to them to
inform their patients of the malfunction. Another Brainlab
official said the U.S. hospitals were in Washington state and
Ohio.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Georges Noel, a radiotherapy expert at the Paul Strauss
cancer center in Strasbourg, France, says this treatment is
reserved for patients who cannot undergo an operation. If the
tumor cannot be removed by surgery, radiotherapy can provide
comparable results, Noel said. For these patients, radiology "is
the most effective alternative," he said.
</P>
<P>
While other treatments for these patients are available, none
provides results as effective as radiotherapy, Noel explained in
an e-mail message.
</P>
<P>
Noel said that the machine malfunctions were potentially harmful
for patients. "A mistargeted machine could irradiate healthy
brain tissue. ... It could kill healthy tissue," Noel said.
Whether this would have a large or small effect on the patient
depends on the part of the brain affected, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Brainlab case has raised concern because it is the latest of
several cases involving brain cancer radiation treatment in
hospitals around France dating back to 2004.
</P>
<P>
In the latest incident, Brainlab alerted the four French
hospitals directly June 7, after it identified a calibration
error in a machine in Spain, Vilsmeier said. That machine has not
yet been used on patients.
</P>
<P>
The problem was identified after 145 patients received an
improper dose of radiation from Brainlab equipment in Toulouse in
southern France in April. It has not yet been determined whether
it was an underdose or an overdose, the French Nuclear Safety
Authority said.
</P>
<P>
Following that incident, Brainlab, in conjunction with two French
regulatory bodies, began a nationwide assessment of all Brainlab
machines in use, and detected the targeting problem. The two
incidents, however, were not connected, the Health Ministry said
in a statement Monday.
</P>
<P>
The ministry responded with an order on Sunday for all four
hospitals using the identified Brainlab equipment to suspend
their activities. Four other brain tumor radiotherapy machines,
not made by Brainlab, in operation elsewhere in France were not
affected.
</P>
<P>
Radiotherapy treatment involves a one-time blast by a high-energy
X-Ray that is aimed from several sources and focused on one point
to kill the tumor. It typically has a margin of error of 0.8
millimeters when used on brain tumors, but when an older software
used to map the brain is combined with a newer aiming apparatus,
that margin can increase, Vilsmeier said in a telephone
interview.
</P>
<P>
In the malfunctioning French machines, the margin was found to
have increased to 1.25 millimeters, Brainlab said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"We don't expect any problems with the patients," said Vilsmeier,
because a doctor will typically use a safety margin of 1 to 3
millimeters (0.04 inches to 0.12 inches).
</P>
<P>
"This security margin is always used to avoid critical organs:
very important parts of the brain such as those that control
sight," said Dr. Christian Carrie, coordinator of radiotherapy at
the Leon Berard Cancer Centre in Lyon.
</P>
<P>
Carrie said that with a security margin, "we cannot be sure, but
we can hope" to avoid killing healthy brain tissue "even if there
is a problem with the targeting of 1 millimeter."
</P>
<P>
Four hospitals, in Nancy, Tours, Montpellier and Paris, shut down
their radiotherapy machines Monday and an analysis of the
machines has begun. The hospitals have also begun the process of
tracking down all patients who may have received treatment from
the malfunctioning machines, a number that may top 620, reported
Le Parisien newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Brainlab is offering a software update that should take care of
the problem, Vilsmeier said.
</P>
<P>
In 2004 and 2005, 24 patients in Epinal received as much as a 30
percent overdose of radiation while undergoing prostate cancer
treatment. Four of these patients died, and their families are
suing the hospitals, claiming that the deaths were a result of
the overdoses.
</P>
<P>
A 32-year-old woman died of complications after receiving a
radiation treatment to an area 10 times the size she should have,
in Lyon in 2004.
</P>
<P>
In both the Epinal and Lyon incidents, hospitals blamed the
problems on human error.
