Commonwealth suspends Pakistan

The Commonwealth said Thursday it had suspended Pakistan until
the restoration of democracy after military ruler Gen. Pervez
Musharraf failed to meet a Thursday deadline to lift emergency
rule and step down as army chief.
</P>
<P>
A committee of foreign ministers "has suspended Pakistan from
councils of the Commonwealth pending restoration of democracy and
rule of law in the country," secretary general Don McKinnon told
journalists.
</P>
<P>
He said the group was disappointed because there had been some
progress -- and cited the release of detainees -- but said it was
concerned about the arrests of journalists and lawyers and said
the Commonwealth's conditions had not been fulfilled.
</P>
<P>
"The state of emergency had not been lifted. The constitution and
the independence of the judiciary not restored and fundamental
rights and the rule of law remain curtailed," McKinnon said,
reading a statement on behalf of the ministers.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, a Pakistani Supreme Court stacked with judges loyal
to Musharraf cleared the way for him to rule as a civilian
president, deciding against a final challenge blocking
ratification of his election last month.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan was last kicked out of the organization in 1999 after
Musharraf seized power in a coup. It took the country five years
to be reinstated.
</P>
<P>
Suspending a member of the 53-member group, based upon Britain
and its former colonies, was done "with a heavy heart" because
every Commonwealth member "is a valued member" said Michael
Frendo, Malta's foreign minister who chaired the committee's
meeting.
</P>
<P>
But he said the suspension was "done with the conviction of the
need to be consistent and to be coherent and to be true to the
sensibilities of the Commonwealth."
</P>
<P>
In a statement, British Prime Minister Gordon Brown said:
"Commonwealth Ministers have made their clear and necessary
decision on suspension of Pakistan from the Commonwealth.
</P>
<P>
"President Musharraf has said that he will take the steps
necessary to restore democracy. The Commonwealth is strongly of
the view that he must now do so."
</P>
<P>
Earlier Thursday, Britain's Queen Elizabeth II, the head of the
Commonwealth, commended the Ugandan government Thursday for its
efforts to end the "devastating conflict," in northern Uganda
where a rebel group has waged a brutal 20-year insurgency.
</P>
<P>
Ugandan government and rebel negotiators have been in on-and-off
talks for 15 months now, mediated by the autonomous regional
government of neighboring Southern Sudan, during which they have
agreed to a truce and are working on a framework for
reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
Uganda is also to be commended for its contribution to
peacekeeping in Somalia, which is "a tribute to the courage and
professionalism of Uganda's armed forces," the 81-year-old
monarch told the Ugandan parliament.
</P>
<P>
Uganda has had about 1,800 troops in Somalia's capital,
Mogadishu, since March as part of African Union efforts to bring
stability there. But no other African country has sent troops
despite endorsing an African Union proposal to have an
8,000-strong mission in the Horn of Africa nation. The
deployments have been delayed because of the lack of funding and
logistical help.
</P>
<P>
The queen also told the Ugandan parliament that the East African
nation has made, "considerable advances in spite of periods of
adversity," since her last visit to the country 50 years ago.
</P>
<P>
"For Ugandans the deliberations and decisions of this house,
together with your respect for the rule of law, have had and will
continue to have an essential bearing on the country's success in
addressing many serious challenges," she told the lawmakers who
had packed parliament.
</P>
<P>
The queen visited an AIDS clinic in the Ugandan capital, Kampala,
before her speech to Parliament. It was her first visit to such a
clinic.
</P>
<P>
"The scourge of HIV infection and AIDS has touched the lives of
too many Ugandan people," she said. "Centers such as this, which
the government of Uganda has done so much to encourage, are
essential in achieving our common aim of controlling this cruel
disease."
</P>
<P>
The queen will open the Commonwealth summit on Friday.
