A French court on Tuesday temporarily delayed the merger of Gaz
de France and Suez by ordering GDF to give workers an outline of
the plan.

<P>
The court barred GDF from "taking any decision relating to the
merger" until the staff gives its opinion of the plan. The merger
between the two energy giants, first announced nearly two years
ago, has met repeated snags.
