MUSIC REVIEW: TWO BANDS IN CONCERT, WITH THE SAME MEMBERS
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNIONDALE, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
"You guys got to pick each other up." Gerard Way had ordered his
band to stop, and now he was holding forth on concert etiquette.
"If somebody -- even one person -- falls down, everybody around
them stops what they're doing and picks them up off the ground."
</P>
<P>
Did the fans agree? They did. So the music came roaring back.
</P>
<P>
Way is the lead singer of My Chemical Romance, and Friday's
concert, at Nassau Coliseum on Long Island, was the second stop
on the band's biggest tour yet. The building was full -- though
not completely full -- of cheerful teenagers, singing along to
every funereal word. And Way, who will be 30 in April, was the
sweetly solicitous ringleader, clearly happy to be singing these
grand emo songs in the place they really belong: an arena.
</P>
<P>
My Chemical Romance never seemed small, though the band did not
always seem quite this big. After a jittery (and pretty great)
2002 debut album, "I Brought You My Bullets, You Brought Me Your
Love" (Eyeball), the members created a brawnier, catchier follow-
up, 2004's "Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge" (Reprise).
</P>
<P>
Way balanced violence ("This is how we like to do it in the
murder scene") with sentiment ("I miss you more than I did
yesterday"), and the CD spawned a couple of big hits.
</P>
<P>
During Friday's concert My Chemical Romance saved the "Three
Cheers" songs for the second half. The set began with Way on a
gurney, singing, "Now come one, come all to this tragic affair."
</P>
<P>
Those are the first lines from the most recent My Chemical
Romance CD, "Welcome to the Black Parade" (Reprise), and for the
next hour the members played that terrific album in its entirety.
In their short black-and-silver jackets, the band members looked
like bellhops, and they claimed they were a different band
entirely.
</P>
<P>
"We are the Black Parade," said Way, as the concert's first half
ended. "My Chemical Romance will be up next."
</P>
<P>
It is a ridiculous distinction, but maybe a useful one, and not
just because it gives the guys an excuse to wear matching
outfits. It is a way for the band members to avoid feeling self-
conscious about a piano ballad called, "Cancer," or a hair-
metallic anthem like "The Sharpest Lives."
</P>
<P>
And while there were a few awkward moments (like the black-and-
white blimps that inflated and then, just as inexplicably,
deflated), the overall effect was impressive.
</P>
<P>
Rather than getting self-conscious about fame, these guys just
concentrated on writing songs as big as their audience: songs
that sound just as good, or maybe better, when the band has
stopped and the house lights are on and the crowd is singing the
chorus.
