KATHMANDU, Nov. 10 (Xinhua)
</P>
<P>
Garbage is piling up in the streets of Nepali capital city with
the Katmandu Metropolitan City (KMC) stopping collection and
management of garbage from Friday.
</P>
<P>
KMC officials said they were compelled to stop the collection of
garbage as a protest against frequent obstructions created by the
locals living around the landfill sites, a leading website,
nepalnews.com reported on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, they have demanded that the government
make proper arrangements so that dumping of garbage could be done
unhindered.
</P>
<P>
The KMC decision came after the locals of Sidol landfill site
refused to allow its containers to enter the area.
</P>
<P>
The locals launched their protest in order to pressure the
government to take action against a group of the Communist Party
of Nepal (Maoist) members who beat up a local resident a few days
earlier.
</P>
<P>
With the KMC officials announcing protest, rubbish is piling up
on main roadsides and vegetable markets. KMC officials on the
other hand said the crisis would continue unless the government
looked into their demands.
