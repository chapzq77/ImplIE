Suicide blast near Islamabad police station kills more than 10
officers on key anniversary

ISLAMABAD, Pakistan 2008-07-06 16:13:04 UTC
</P>
<P>
A suicide attacker detonated explosives near a police station in
Pakistan's capital on Sunday, killing more than 10 police
officers, officials said.
</P>
<P>
The evening blast occurred in a kiosk in front of the police
station, which is also near Islamabad's Melody Market shopping
area, said Naeem Iqbal, a police spokesman. Television footage
showed wounded security forces being taken away and ambulances
rushing to the area.
</P>
<P>
Just moments before the explosion, an Associated Press reporter
passed by the scene and saw more than 20 security officials
gathered nearby. After the blast, a traffic intersection in the
area was splattered with blood. Body parts were scattered as far
as 50 yards (meters) from the scene. Shattered glass also covered
the area, which police cordoned off.
</P>
<P>
The blast in the usually tranquil capital came as thousands of
Islamists gathered about one-half mile (a kilometer) away to mark
the one-year anniversary of a deadly military crackdown on the
radical, pro-Taliban Red Mosque. But it was not immediately clear
if the events were linked, and a mosque official condemned the
attack.
</P>
<P>
The explosion also came following recent threats of revenge from
militants in Pakistan angered by a paramilitary operation against
insurgents in the tribal northwest.
</P>
<P>
Rana Akbar Hayat, a senior government official, said more than 10
people were killed and "two, three" others were wounded. "All are
police officials," Hayat told reporters near the scene. "It was
targeted to the forces by the suicider."
</P>
<P>
Interior Ministry chief Rehman Malik said that based on witness
accounts, the attacker was a man appearing to be "35-, 37-years-
old" who ran into the crowd of police. He said police have found
the "upper part" of his body but did not give more specifics.
</P>
<P>
Malik said the nation has to think "who is destabilizing our
country" and take action.
</P>
<P>
"We have to take them out from our ranks," he said. "We have to
combat them."
</P>
<P>
Imtiaz Khan, the casualty medical officer at Federal Government
Services Hospital, said at least 36 injured people were admitted
there, nearly all security officials. He said two had died, while
12 were in critical condition.
</P>
<P>
Violence levels have fallen in Pakistan since last year, but
attacks still occur as resentment continues in some corners
against the country's partnership with the U.S. in the war on
terror.
</P>
<P>
In June, a suicide car bomber killed at least six people near the
Danish Embassy in Islamabad. A statement attributed to al-Qaida
took responsibility for that blast, believed to have targeted
Denmark over the publication of cartoons depicting the Prophet
Muhammad.
</P>
<P>
A new government that came to power following February elections
has sought to end militancy in Pakistan primarily through peace
deals with extremists. That approach has earned criticism from
U.S. officials, who say the deals will simply give time for
militants to regroup and intensify attacks on foreign forces in
neighboring Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
In late June, as militants in Pakistan's northwest increasingly
began threatening the key city of Peshawar, the government
launched a paramilitary operation in Khyber tribal region to
flush out the extremists.
</P>
<P>
That operation has now been halted while officials try to
negotiate peace through tribal elders, but Pakistani Taliban
leaders have vowed revenge for the government's show of force.
</P>
<P>
Much of last year's violence came on the heels of the military
crackdown on the Red Mosque.
</P>
<P>
The siege of the mosque came amid an increasingly violent anti-
vice campaign led by the mosque's administrators in which roaming
bands of students harassed music and video shops, sometimes
kidnapping women accused of being prostitutes. Tensions boiled
over into gunbattles with security forces trying to enforce
government authority.
</P>
<P>
The government said 102 people, including 11 security personnel,
were killed in the standoff that began July 3 last year.
</P>
<P>
The siege seriously undermined the government's reputation among
ordinary Pakistanis, many of whom believe far more people died,
including women and children.
</P>
<P>
A year later, the mosque siege still resonates among militant
groups, which have referred to it in videos as a rallying cry.
</P>
<P>
Mohammed Amir Siddiq, a spokesman for the Red Mosque, denounced
Sunday's suicide attack and said he was not aware if any of those
at the anniversary gathering were wounded.
</P>
<P>
"This is a very tragic and condemnable incident," Siddiq told The
Associated Press. He said the mosque held prayers for victims of
the bombing after regular evening prayers.
</P>
<P>
Kamal Shah, the interior ministry secretary, denied that the
bombing was a result of poor security for the Red Mosque
gathering, during which many attendees called for Islamic law and
demanded the hanging of President Pervez Musharraf.
</P>
<P>
Security arrangements made for the anniversary ceremony were
"absolutely comprehensive," he said, noting that "nothing
happened to the participants of the gathering."
