UN agencies, NGOs launch Georgia appeal
</HEADLINE>

<P>
UN agencies and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) on Monday
appealed for 58.6 million dollars (40 million euros) to provide
relief aid for tens of thousands of civilians affected by the
conflict in Georgia.The UN Office for the Coordination of
Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said the money will be used by nine
UN agencies, including the refugee agency UNHCR and the
children's agency UNICEF, and 16 NGO's and international bodies
to help 128,700 people displaced within Georgia over the next six
months.

<P>
OCHA said current needs included food; health and nutrition;
protection; shelter and non-food items; and water, sanitation and
hygiene.
</P>
<P>
This flash appeal is about helping vulnerable people in serious
need, said Catherine Bragg, the UN assistant secretary general
for humanitarian affairs and deputy emergency relief coordinator.
</P>
<P>
OCHA said the humanitarian response had been complicated by
limited access and the fact that those affected had gathered in
numerous sites, making it harder for the government and aid
agencies to reach them.
</P>
<P>
Bragg stressed that the humanitarian crisis was continually
evolving.

<P>
"While the most acute phase of the violence appears to have
passed, until there is a firm peace in the country we must be
prepared to respond to a critical and fluctuating humanitarian
situation, she said.

<P>
Russia agreed to a French-brokered deal with Tbilisi after
routing Georgia's US- trained army in a five-day blitz last week.
</P>
<P>
Russian troops responded to a Georgian offensive on August 7
against Moscow- backed separatists in South Ossetia, which broke
away from Georgia in the 1990s.
