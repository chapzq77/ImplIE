Two newspaper employees died on Wednesday when their office was
set ablaze by supporters of a politician angered by a survey
published which showed his popularity was low, a report said.
</P>
<P>
Scores of people armed with stones and petrol bombs attacked the
office of Tamil-language daily Dinakaran in the southern state of
Tamil Nadu, and protests also erupted in other parts of the
state.
</P>
<P>
The two men -- both engineers -- died of suffocation when they
entered the office to save their computers and could not escape
because protesters had locked the building, Muthupandi, editor of
the daily's local edition, told the Press Trust of India.
</P>
<P>
The protesters were upset over the findings of a survey published
by the newspaper that showed little support for their leader M.K.
Azhagiri, but high ratings for his brother and bitter rival in
state politics.
</P>
<P>
Both political leaders are the sons of Tamil Nadu's chief
minister and popular leader K. Karunanidhi, and are seen as his
possible successors.
</P>
<P>
Mob violence because of political loyalties is not uncommon in
Tamil Nadu.
</P>
<P>
This year, a court sentenced three political workers to death and
25 others to jail terms for a firebomb attack on a bus that
killed three students after an opposition party protested over
the conviction of their leader in a corruption case seven years
ago.
