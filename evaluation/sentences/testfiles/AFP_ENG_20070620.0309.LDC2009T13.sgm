Students at Zambia's biggest university Wednesday began an
indefinite class boycott to protest against poor sanitation at
their campus days after staging violent protests, a union
official said.
</P>
<P>
Riot police have sealed off the campus and roads leading to the
University of Zambia in Lusaka, where students holding the
boycott were also planning demonstrations, said Mercy Nankamba.
</P>
<P>
The protest has been prompted by a decision from the university's
management to reduce cleaning staff at student hostels due to
lack of funding, Nankamba said.
</P>
<P>
"The students are merely expressing their concern over the poor
sanitation at the campus," she said.

<P>
Last week, students at the same university staged violent
demonstrations, smashing vehicle windows and blocking main roads
near the campus to protest against a strike by their lecturers
who were demanding better wages.

<P>
On Monday, at Zambia's second largest university, riot policemen
fired tear gas and arrested dozens of students for staging
violent protests against a delay in allowance payments, the
police said.

<P>
Thirty students were detained at the Copperbelt university for
their role in the protest in which property at the campus was
destroyed and items were stolen, police spokesman Mhakeni Zulu
said.

<P>
The students at the state-run university were protesting against
the government's delay in paying them meal and book allowances
under a bursary scheme for students.
