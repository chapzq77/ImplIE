The price of oil has surged to a new record, with a barrel a
crude trading above $112 a barrel on the New York Mercantile
Exchange.

A U.S. government report on Wednesday stating that oil and fuel
supplies were lower than expected last week gave crude a push
past its latest milestone. But months of buying by speculators
and by investors seeking refuge from a falling dollar have also
lifted oil to its new heights.

Light, sweet crude for May delivery has traded as high as
$112.16, surpassing the previous trading record of $111.80 set
last month.
