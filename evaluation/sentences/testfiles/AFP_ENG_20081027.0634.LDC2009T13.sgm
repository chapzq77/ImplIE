Markets tumble on recession fears despite G7, IMF moves
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Growing fears of global recession sent shares plummeting Monday
as markets shrugged off fresh government measures to protect
shell-shocked economies and a G7 pledge to stabilise the
financial system.
</P>
<P>
The IMF unveiled rescue plans for Ukraine and Hungary, South
Korea slashed its key interest rate, Japan announced fresh action
to boost its ailing stock market and Australia's central bank
intervened to prop up its currency.
</P>
<P>
The G7 club of rich nations vowed to cooperate to stabilise the
system, and voiced concern about "excessive volatility" in the
Japanese yen.
</P>
<P>
Japan's Nikkei index plunged 6.36 percent by the close, hitting
the lowest level since October 1982 before the economic bubble.
</P>
<P>
It was similarly turbulent across Asia. Hong Kong was down 12.2
percent in afternoon trade, Taipei stocks sank 4.65 percent, and
Sydney closed down 1.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
Manila reeled from a plunge of 12.3 percent and Chinese shares
closed down 6.32 percent.
</P>
<P>
"There is more pain left," warned Atul Mehra, head of capital
markets with brokerage J M Financial in Mumbai where stocks
dropped more than 10 percent to below the psychological 8,000
points barrier.
</P>
<P>
"The global turmoil does not appear to be resolving soon."
</P>
<P>
Bucking the trend, Seoul recovered from heavy early losses to
close up 0.8 percent after South Korea's central bank cut its key
interest rate by 75 basis points -- its largest reduction yet.
</P>
<P>
The statement by the G7 key economies -- Britain, Canada, France,
Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States -- sought to calm
nerves by affirming their "shared interest in a strong and stable
international financial system."
</P>
<P>
"We continue to monitor markets closely and cooperate as
appropriate," the statement from their finance ministers and
central bank chiefs said.
</P>
<P>
They also warned the yen's volatility posed "possible adverse
implications for economic and financial stability," but dealers
said the statement had few teeth and may show the G7 had no
stomach for intervention.
</P>
<P>
The currency, which has been rising as investors seek cover from
the market turmoil by unwinding bets funded with cheap Japanese
credit, stayed at 13-year highs against the dollar, which was
trading at 93.46 yen in afternoon trade.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Australia's central bank moved to shore up the local
dollar after it plunged 3.7 percent against the US currency.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's de facto central bank did likewise for the third time
in eight days to maintain the local currency's peg to the
greenback.
</P>
<P>
As well as the rate cut, South Korea said it would press for big
tax cuts and spending increases to better shield its export-
driven economy from falling global demand.
</P>
<P>
President Lee Myung-Bak insisted the nation would not face a
repeat of the 1997-98 financial crisis, after the local stock
market last week suffered its biggest weekly decline and the won
plunged to a 10-year low.
</P>
<P>
In Japan, Prime Minister Taro Aso announced fresh measures to
support its stock market, tightening curbs on short-selling and
boosting a government fund to pump capital into banks if needed.
</P>
<P>
He did not specify the amount of new money to inject into banks
but Kaoru Yosano, the economic and fiscal policy minister, said
Sunday that Tokyo would likely increase it from two to 10
trillion yen (110 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, the IMF said it would lend 16.5 billion dollars to
Ukraine and would announce a "substantial" package for Hungary in
the next few days.
</P>
<P>
The deals followed a 2.1-billion-dollar loan to Iceland and came
amid calls for assistance from other countries including Belarus
and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
The Washington-based institution has said it can provide up to
200 billion dollars in loans to countries facing financial
difficulties.
</P>
<P>
US and European markets already suffered heavy losses on Friday,
with Wall Street's Dow Jones index ending down 3.59 percent, and
investors are ready for further turbulence.
</P>
<P>
The US Federal Reserve is expected to cut interest rates
Wednesday from 1.5 percent, but US gross domestic product figures
for the third quarter, due for release Thursday, are set to show
a decline.
</P>
<P>
Other key indicators on both sides of the Atlantic and a flood of
results and outlooks from US, European and Japanese companies are
unlikely to lift the mood.
