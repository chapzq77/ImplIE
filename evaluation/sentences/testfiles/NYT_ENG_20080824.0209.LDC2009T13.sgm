MICHELLE OBAMA SEEN AS STABILIZING FORCE FOR HER HUSBAND
</HEADLINE>

Denver -- Adoring crowds chant his name and Republican opponents
compare Democratic presidential hopeful Barack Obama to Hollywood
celebrities.
</P>
<P>
At home in Chicago, Obama's wife, Michelle, sometimes reminds him
"he's not all that."
</P>
<P>
"She keeps him in check," said Bethann Hester, 45, of Chicago, a
friend of Michelle Obama's for 15 years. "She holds him to a high
standard."
</P>
<P>
Michelle Obama takes the stage in Denver Monday night, where
she'll seek to sell her husband to America, sharing stories about
"the values that drive him, experiences that shaped him, and why
I believe he will be an extraordinary president," she said in an
e-mail response to questions submitted by The Denver Post. "I'll
also share stories about my life and my background with the
country."
</P>
<P>
While those details might win some voters, just as important,
political historians said, is what Michelle Obama, 45, will
reveal about her relationship with her husband and how they'd
interact in the White House. The first lady, they said, is the
person perhaps best positioned to tell the president the truth
when he needs to hear it.
</P>
<P>
"Figuring out what the first lady is going to do in the office is
one thing, but even more important is the partnership between a
first lady and her husband," said Doris Kearns Goodwin, author of
several books on presidents. "That's where the influence can be
monumental."
</P>
<P>
Michelle Obama's influence likely will be large. She and her
husband are so intertwined that one can't be examined without
looking at the other, family and friends say. They finish each
other's sentences, needle each other when needed, are best
friends, partners and genuinely in love.
</P>
<P>
Asked during an event last week at Saddleback Church in
California which three people he trusted most and would rely on
as president, Obama named his wife first.
</P>
<P>
"Barack is a wonderful husband and father," Michelle Obama said.
"He is a total partner to me -- my best friend, my greatest
adviser, my rock. We take great care of each other -- in part
because we have complementary strengths. I've helped him become
more organized. He's helped me become more patient."
</P>
<P>
Michelle Obama, as described by her family and friends, is equal
parts Wonder Woman and Everywoman. A successful businesswoman,
she is seen as dedicated to her daughters Malia, 10, and Sasha,
7, adored by her husband, and shaped by the values of her
working-class parents.
</P>
<P>
"She's the kindest person that I know," said Yvonne Davila, 49,
of Chicago, who's known Michelle Obama since they worked together
in Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley's office 18 years ago.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Michelle Obama has plenty of critics. Obama
opponents pounced when she remarked in February, "for the first
time in my adult lifetime, I'm really proud of my country."
Obama's camp said the remark referred to pride in Americans
becoming involved in the democratic process.
</P>
<P>
It's a comment Republicans will remind people of often throughout
the election.
</P>
<P>
In eastern Colorado, people who lost their jobs in 2006 when a
pickle plant closed question what role Michelle Obama played. She
was on the board of directors of TreeHouse Foods, which shuttered
the facility.
</P>
<P>
"We started hearing after everybody lost their jobs, (that) she
had a lot to do with it," said Michelle Barela, 45, of La Junta,
who had worked at the pickle plant 15 years.
</P>
<P>
Obama spokeswoman Jen Psaki told The Denver Post in 2006 that
Michelle Obama "was not the sole vote or even major decider on
this issue."
</P>
<P>
The daughter of Fraser and Marian Robinson, Michelle Obama grew
up in a one-bedroom apartment above her aunt's home on Chicago's
South Side.
</P>
<P>
The Robinson children learned an ethic of hard work, especially
from Michelle Obama's father, who was diagnosed at age 30 with
multiple sclerosis and continued working as a pump operator for
the Chicago water department, said Michelle Obama's brother,
Craig Robinson, 46.
</P>
<P>
As a result, he said, both he and his sister "value how lucky you
are to be able to get up and go to work. You can't complain about
anything when you had a dad with MS who gets up and goes to work
every day."
</P>
<P>
Michelle Obama went to Princeton University on a scholarship,
then Harvard Law School, then to corporate law firm Sidley Austin
LLP, where she met Barack Obama in 1989 when she was assigned as
his mentor.
</P>
<P>
"They told her this brilliant young Harvard kid is coming here,"
said author Kearns Goodwin, who talked with Michelle Obama during
the 2004 Democratic National Convention. "She felt her job in
some ways was to knock him down a few pegs, to keep him in line."
</P>
<P>
On their first date the two saw the Spike Lee movie "Do The Right
Thing" and went for ice cream. A few months later, Michelle Obama
asked her brother to help evaluate her new beau.
</P>
<P>
"She said,'Hey, take him to play a game of basketball and tell me
what you think,' " said Robinson, head basketball coach at Oregon
State University.
</P>
<P>
Their father, Robinson said, believed that a basketball game
revealed people's personality.
</P>
<P>
"I found him to be extremely confident but not cocky," Robinson
said. "I found him to have a good sense of team."
</P>
<P>
The Obamas were married in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Their marriage makes each of them stronger, Robinson said. "They
complement each other in a way that makes them both better
collectively and individually," Robinson said.
