BAGHDAD
</P>
<P>
Iraqis often complain about the problems in their country and the
government's lack of obvious progress in solving them.
</P>
<P>
But as drivers in traffic-clogged Baghdad learned this week,
Iraqi officials are taking action in one area: strict enforcement
of a seat belt law.
</P>
<P>
Later this month, traffic police officers all over Iraq will
start issuing tickets to any scofflaw who drives without buckling
up. Violators will be fined 15,000 dinars -- about $12.50.
</P>
<P>
"It is part of the healing process of this country and of Baghdad
to enforce the law, law by law," said Brig. Gen. Zuhair Abada
Mraweh, traffic commander for the capital's Rusafah district.
</P>
<P>
"The citizens are learning the laws step by step," said Mraweh,
sitting in his office in the Karada neighborhood. "We have
applied all the laws concerning traffic, so it's time for the
seat belt law to be practiced."
</P>
<P>
Some might say that that there are more pressing issues, like the
car bombs that can turn a morning commute into a nightmare of
blood and body parts, the daily killings and kidnappings, the
political and sectarian infighting.
</P>
<P>
Or that enforcing the seat belt law might not be an adequate
solution in a city where traffic rarely moves above a crawl,
checkpoints are ubiquitous, roads are often blocked and it is not
uncommon to see a vehicle charging down a street in the wrong
direction or abruptly swerving across lanes.
</P>
<P>
Still, brigades of traffic officers trying valiantly to do their
jobs have been a constant in an ever-changing landscape of war
and chaos over the last five years. And as traffic police
officers warned Baghdad drivers earlier this week that seat belt
enforcement was about to begin, many drivers said it was probably
a good thing.
</P>
<P>
"It is a symbol of civilization," said a taxi driver, Ahmed
Wahayid, whose 1993 Honda Elantra was stuck in a long line of
cars waiting to clear a checkpoint. "Western people in Europe and
America have it, so we are like them." Wahayid said he could not
find words to describe the traffic in Baghdad. "It's a very, very
bad feeling, and if I didn't need to drive in order to eat and
live I wouldn't," he said.
</P>
<P>
Hussain Fathil, 35, trying to guide his 1991 Opel through the
logjam, put it more briefly: "It pulls your heart apart," he
said.
</P>
<P>
But he doubted whether enforcing the seat belt law would help.
"Do you want to know my opinion?' he said. "This law cannot be
applied in such a city."
</P>
<P>
But he had his seat belt on and said that he would keep wearing
it. "It's the law," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mraweh said that the seat belt legislation -- which applies only
to drivers, not passengers -- was in effect during the government
of Saddam Hussein. After the Americans invaded in 2003, a high
import tax on automobiles was lifted, flooding Iraq with
enthusiastic new drivers. He said there were no dependable
statistics on traffic accidents, but that enforcing the law would
reduce them by 70 percent.
</P>
<P>
Mraweh is passionate about traffic control. He is particularly
irked by the driving behavior by the employees of security
companies like Blackwater, who sometimes throw water bottles at
people walking down the street or shoot their guns in the air to
clear the road, he said.
</P>
<P>
But primarily, Mraweh sees his job as a way to piece together his
shattered country.
</P>
<P>
"If everyone says there are killings, there are massacres, then I
will stay powerless at home and this will disable the country,"
he said. "But if the grocer goes to work, the merchant goes to
work, I go to work, even you go to work, there will be no more
killing, and the criminal will be afraid and he will go back to
his den like a mouse"
