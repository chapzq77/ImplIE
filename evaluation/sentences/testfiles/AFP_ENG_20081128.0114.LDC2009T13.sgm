Spain's public deficit will surpass EU limit during next two
years: minister
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Spain's public deficit will likely surpass the eurozone limit of
3.0 percent of economic output in 2008 and 2009 because of
government measures to shore up financial markets and aid the
sluggish economy, Economy Minister Pedro Solbes said Friday.
</P>
<P>
"I believe we will surpass the three percent limit in 2008 and
2009 will probably not be the year in which we can backtrack," he
told a news conference following a weekly cabinet meeting in
which the government approved an 11 -billion-euro  (14.3-billion-
dollar) economic stimulus package.
</P>
<P>
Spain's public deficit will "probably" return to the limits of
the Stability and Growth Pact in 2010, Solbes said, adding it was
"premature" to announce this with certainty in current global
economic circumstances.
</P>
<P>
"The Stability Pact is not dead but we will use the margins" that
allow for it to be surpassed during "exceptional circumstances,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
Spain posted a budget surplus for the third year running in 2007,
equivalent to 2.23 percent of output, and had a public debt
equivalent to about 40 percent of its GDP.
</P>
<P>
But public income has plunged as the global credit crunch has put
the squeeze on an already weakened construction sector.
</P>
<P>
The economy contracted for the first time since 1993 in the third
quarter, shrinking 0.2 percent, leaving it on the brink of
recession, which is defined as two consecutive quarters of
negative growth.
