Thai cabinet meets on protest crisis: official
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Thai Prime Minister Somchai Wongsawat began an urgent cabinet
meeting in the northern city of Chiang Mai on Thursday to discuss
the growing political crisis, an official said.
</P>
<P>
The meeting held at the city's provincial hall was guarded by
hundreds of police while pro-government supporters dressed in
signature red shirts also maintained security after a deadly
clash a day earlier.
</P>
<P>
"The meeting has just started," chief provincial spokesperson
Parntip Thongngamkham told AFP by telephone.
</P>
<P>
Somchai said in a television address on Wednesday night that he
had called the "urgent" cabinet meeting "to map out measures to
restore nomalcy" as anti- government protesters seized two
Bangkok airports.
</P>
<P>
He also rejected a call by the powerful Thai army chief to call
snap elections, saying that his government was legitimate.
</P>
<P>
Fighting between rival political groups in Chiang Mai left one
anti-government supporter dead on Wednesday, shortly after
Somchai arrived there from a foreign trip.
</P>
<P>
He had been unable to fly to Bangkok because of the protests and
instead chose to divert to Chiang Mai, the stronghold of his
brother-in-law, ousted former premier Thaksin Shinawatra.
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said at least ten men in red shirts stood at every gate
of the provincial hall as well as police.
