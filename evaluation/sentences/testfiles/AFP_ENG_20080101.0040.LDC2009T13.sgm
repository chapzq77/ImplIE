Athletics: Gatlin loses appeal, receives four-year ban: report
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Reigning 100-meter Olympic champion Justin Gatlin has been
suspended for four years for a 2006 doping violation after his
20-month appeal fight failed, the Washington Post reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Citing unnamed sources close to the case, the newspaper reported
that Gatlin was told Monday night that arbitrators voted 2-1 to
impose a four-year ban upon the 25-year-old American sprinter who
captured gold at the 2004 Athens Games.
</P>
<P>
The punishment stems from a positive test for testosterone by
Gatlin at the Kansas Relays on April 22, 2006. Gatlin tested
positive for a stimulant at a college meet earlier in his career
so was treated as a repeat offender.
</P>
<P>
Gatlin could appeal the verdict to the Court of Arbitration for
Sport (CAS), the final legal recourse to overturn what would
otherwise likely be a career-ending banishment.
</P>
<P>
Gatlin's attorney, John Collins, declined to comment to the
newspaper, saying he wanted to see the 53-page majority opinion
and 22-page dissent before saying anything publicly.
</P>
<P>
Two of the trio of arbitrators who heard the case July 29 through
August 1 in Atlanta declared they could not impose anything less
than a four-year ban upon Gatlin because of his prior positive
test.
</P>
<P>
Gatlin, the 2005 world 100m and 200m champion, had faced up to an
eight-year ban but was nonetheless devastated by the decision
that could doom his hopes of racing at the Beijing Olympics, the
Post said, citing people close to Gatlin.
</P>
<P>
First violations usually draw a two-year ban with life bans
possible for repeat offenders.
</P>
<P>
Gatlin argued to arbitartors that his secret recording of
telephone calls with his former coach and assistant coach to
gather evidence for a federal steroid investigation should be
considered in imposing a sentence.
</P>
<P>
Gatlin said if he had knowingly taken performance-enhancing
drugs, it would have been revealed in 10 telephone calls he
recorded in 2006 with former coach Trevor Graham and Randall
Evans, Graham's assistant.
</P>
<P>
Graham has been indicted on charges of lying to federal
investigators about his relationship with a confessed steroid
dealer.
</P>
<P>
Jeff Novitzky, the federal agent investigating Graham as well as
the BALCO steroid scandal, told the arbitrators that no evidence
was uncovered that Gatlin took drugs.
</P>
<P>
Gatlin also argued that he might have been sabotaged by a massage
therapist who could have rubbed a testosterone cream onto
Gatlin's legs over being denied a bonus in 2005.
</P>
<P>
The therapist denied the claim but also said he did not think
Gatlin was a dope cheat.
</P>
<P>
Another part of Gatlin's case was that he would not have tried to
sneak testosterone past dope tests at an early season meet then
not used it for the remainder of the 2006 season.
</P>
<P>
Chris Campbell, the arbitrator who dissented in the four-year ban
verdict, said Gatlin had proven his sabotage case only 33 percent
not the 50.1 percent needed to avoid punishment - a gap Gatlin
could try to close before CAS.
</P>
<P>
Campbell also said Gatlin had been discriminated against under
the Americans with Disabilities Act because his first positive
was for a stimulant that was included in his medication for
attention-deficit disorder.
