Bush, Democrats struggle for accord to expand counterterror
eavesdropping

WASHINGTON 2007-08-04 00:15:13 UTC

<P>
Congress and the White House struggled over expanding authority
to eavesdrop on suspected foreign terrorists in a high-stakes
showdown over national security.
</P>
<P>
"We're still hopeful that something can be worked out," said
Ellen Cioccio, a spokeswoman for Director of National
Intelligence Mike McConnell, after a day of fitful negotiations
Friday. "They're still talking."
</P>
<P>
Democratic leaders cleared the way for votes on different
measures -- at least two in the Senate and one in the House.
</P>
<P>
That left the outcome in doubt hours after President George W.
Bush implored Congress to send him a bill before leaving this
weekend on a monthlong vacation.
</P>
<P>
In the House, Democrats claimed they had acceded to White House
requests, but Bush's aides disputed that.
</P>
<P>
Two bills emerged in the Senate, one with White House support,
the other without.
</P>
<P>
In his remarks, Bush coupled his demand for legislation with a
threat. He said would veto any bill by the Democratic-led
Congress that his intelligence director deemed unable "to prevent
an attack on the country."
</P>
<P>
"We've worked hard and in good faith with the Democrats to find a
solution, but we are not going to put our national security at
risk," Bush said after meeting with counterterror and homeland
security officials at FBI headquarters. "Time is short."
</P>
<P>
The Bush administration began pressing for changes to the law
after a recent ruling by the special Foreign Intelligence
Surveillance Act, or FISA, court that barred the government from
eavesdropping on foreign suspects whose messages were being
routed through U.S. communications carriers, including Internet
sites.
</P>
<P>
Democrats agree the law should not restrict U.S. spies from
tapping in on foreign suspects. However, they want the FISA court
to review the eavesdropping process before it begins to make sure
that Americans aren't targeted.
