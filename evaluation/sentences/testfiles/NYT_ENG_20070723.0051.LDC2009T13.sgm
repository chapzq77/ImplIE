THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE ADDS ANOTHER NEW WORD
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sometimes, you don't have to go to great lengths to make a point;
things just happen in their due time. In the meantime, there are
plenty of telenovelas on TV to help pass the time.
</P>
<P>
For those who aren't familiar with the sexy soaps, a telenovela
is a daily dose of high drama, served up in Spanish. The acting
is usually over the top, the story arcs are generally syrupy
rags-to-riches tales or boy-meets-girl confections. The wardrobe
and makeup departments are often over-utilized. It's just like
the daytime soaps, with rolling r's.
</P>
<P>
In other words, the word "telenovela" is, in many ways, the
definition of mind candy, but not according to the dictionary.
The word telenovela is, according to Merriam-Webster, defined as
a Latin American soap opera.
</P>
<P>
According to Merriam-Webster's Web site, the collegiate
dictionary is updated yearly with a list of new "words, senses
and variants." This year, the words ginormous, sudoku, chaebol,
Bollywood and telenovela were officially welcomed into the
dictionary and into the English language.
</P>
<P>
Big deal, right? Those who partake in the daily doses of
telenovela fun know what they're called, and those who don't
aren't necessarily going to tune in just because Merriam-Webster
gave their nod. Besides, who died and left ol' M-W.com in charge
of English?
</P>
<P>
Still, the fact that a group of wordsmiths and gatekeepers --
students of the English language -- gave their nod to this word,
just as they do to other words plucked from foreign languages, is
a great thing.
</P>
<P>
Here's what this means: the parameters of the English language
stretch a little at a time to make room for new words -- such as
IED, perfect storm and smackdown -- that make their way into
American conversations in ENGLISH.
</P>
<P>
"Telenovela" emoted its way in because Spanish-language
entertainment really is quite popular in the U.S., and among lots
of people who have no problem having conversations in English.
</P>
<P>
Take that, Gov. Schwarzenegger.
</P>
<P>
Nobody marched through the streets waving a Mexican flag
demanding an official definition. Nobody called the ACLU, MALDEF
or LULAC. Nobody had to invoke the spirit of Emiliano Zapata,
Pancho Villa, Cesar Chavez or Edward James Olmos.
</P>
<P>
But last week, a word that was part of the Spanish language
quietly became part of the English language. That's how
assimilation happens; that's how language grows, that's how
understanding unfolds.
</P>
<P>
Which proves that making a point doesn't always require a
ginormous effort.
