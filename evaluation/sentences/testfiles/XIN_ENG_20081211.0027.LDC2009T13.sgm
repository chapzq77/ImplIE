Israeli authorities warn against visiting Goa, India
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM, Dec. 10 (Xinhua) -- Israel's Counter Terrorism
Bureau(CTB) on Wednesday issued a travel advisory warning
Israelis not to visit the Goa region of India.
</P>
<P>
"The Goa region is a potentially tempting target for Islamic
terror groups, particularly leading up to the New Year
celebrations," local news service Ynet quoted the CTB as saying
in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that the warning was "very concrete", the CTB
recommended that all trips to the area be postponed to the end of
December.
</P>
<P>
The warning came two weeks after a series of terrorist attacks
which claimed the lives of 171 people, including six Israelis, in
Mumbai, India's financial capital.
</P>
<P>
Chief Minister of Goa Digambar Kamat was quoted as saying that
the region has always been a preferred target for terrorists
because it attracts some two million tourists a year, and the
local security forces have increased their anti-terror measures.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the CTB has also reiterated its travel advisory for
Jammu and Kashmir, which was issued following threats from the
leadership of a major Kashmiri terrorist outfit to attack
Israelis.
