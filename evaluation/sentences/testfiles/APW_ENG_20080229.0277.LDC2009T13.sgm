A suicide bomber ignited a blast Friday when police knocked on a
house door during a sweep targeting Tamil rebels in Sri Lanka's
capital and the explosion wounded seven people, including three
police officers, the military said.
</P>
<P>
Police officers were searching a neighborhood in the northern
part of Colombo for Tamil Tiger rebels suspected of infiltrating
the capital and had just knocked on a door of a house at dawn
when the blast was triggered inside, military spokesman Brig.
Udaya Nanayakkara said.

<P>
The blast killed the bomber and wounded seven other people,
including three police officers, he said.
</P>
<P>
He blamed the Tigers for the blast. The group could not
immediately be reached for comment. It routinely denies
responsibility for such attacks.

<P>
Three policemen and four civilians were being treated at Colombo
National Hospital, said Anil Jasinghe, a doctor at the hospital.

An Associated Press photographer at the scene saw the blown-off
head of the suicide bomber on the concrete roof of the adjoining
building.

Authorities have stepped up security searches on buses and trains
and in neigbhoorhoods of Colombo and other ethnic Sinhalese-
majority areas after a series of bomb blasts killed about 90
civilians so far this year, according to the military.
</P>
<P>
The Tamil Tigers, listed as a terror group by the U.S. and
European Union, are blamed for more than 240 suicide attacks
against political, military and economic targets during their
long separatist campaign.
</P>
<P>
Violence has escalated on this Indian Ocean island since the
government withdrew from a 2002 cease-fire with Tamil rebels last
month.
</P>
<P>
Tamil Tiger rebels have fought the government since 1983 to
create a separate homeland for the country's ethnic minority
Tamils. More than 70,000 people have been killed in the conflict.
