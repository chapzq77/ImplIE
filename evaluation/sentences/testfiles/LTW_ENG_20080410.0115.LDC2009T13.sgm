Bill Would Require Faster Warnings to Students
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Many believe if the students had been notified earlier, they
might not have gone to class," McCarthy said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The law currently requires universities to notify students in a
"timely manner." But McCarthy said that standard is too
subjective and could cost lives, like at Virginia Tech -- when
the university waited nearly two hours to e-mail students that a
gunman was on campus. Thirty-two people were killed.
</P>
<P>
McCarthy's proposal also requires that universities annually
publish and test emergency response procedures.
</P>
<P>
Colleges would have until 2009 to set up campus-wide alert
systems using whatever method they chose -- such as automated
cell-phone calls or text messages -- but the proposal doesn't yet
include funds for institutions to do so.
</P>
<P>
Gun violence hits home for McCarthy -- whose son was injured and
her husband killed by a gunman while riding a Long Island Rail
Road train in 1993. The tragedy was the platform that propelled
her to a seat in Congress.
</P>
<P>
On Long Island, Stony Brook University used its own emergency
system in late February -- when a cafeteria worker falsely
reported a man with a gun.
</P>
<P>
The university alerted students 26 minutes after getting the
report, a reasonable amount of time to respond to such a threat
-- but which might not be feasible at other times, said Robert
Lenahan, university emergency management director.
</P>
<P>
"There may be some circumstances where you may need to take a
little more time to verify the accuracy," Lenahan said.
</P>
<P>
That's why the American Council on Education opposes the "one-
size-fits-all mandate," said Terry W. Hartle, the council's
senior vice president for government and public affairs.
</P>
<P>
"Campus security officers want to convey information as timely,
accurate and useful," Hartle said. "If you choose one of those
three over the others, you may not be providing the best
information people need."
</P>
<P>
But alerts within 30 minutes could save lives, said Joe Samaha,
father of Virginia Tech victim Reema Samaha. "If we do not learn
the lesson, we will have lost our students for nothing," he said.
