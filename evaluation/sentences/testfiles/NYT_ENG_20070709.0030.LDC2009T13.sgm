To those of a certain age - Generation Ex, let's say - "The
Doctors' Plot" recalls the charge by Stalin that a cabal of
physicians was scheming to poison Soviet political and military
leaders. Before the resulting round-up ran its course in early
1953, scores had been executed or exiled to the gulag.
</P>
<P>
Stalin died within months, all on his own and without the
encouragement of any poison. The whole supposed plot had been a
phony, as the new Kremlin leadership quickly conceded.
</P>
<P>
The physicians arrested were almost all Jewish. The affair had
been part of a broad campaign of anti-Semitism, which Stalin had
ordered up. Strip off the Soviet surface and, at bottom, you have
an old fashioned Russian pogrom, with the gavel as the weapon of
choice.
</P>
<P>
(Stalin would have been in no danger even if the plot had been
real. Paranoid, he had long since quit medical doctors in favor
of veterinarians. But a plot by wicked veterinarians would have
been a tough sell even to a populace accustomed to being
dutifully gulled.)
</P>
<P>
Now we have another doctors' plot, this one very real. Six
immigrant Muslim physicians are under arrest in Britain, another
in Australia, dozens more have been questioned and Lord knows how
many are being quietly investigated in other nations.
</P>
<P>
The two car bombs in London, built to kill and to rip large
numbers of innocents, in the manner for such enterprises,
fizzled. Though it exploded, a hastily assembled third car bomb
caused no injuries either, except to the two doctors aboard who
rammed it into the Glasgow airport.
</P>
<P>
But make no mistake. There is wide collateral damage all the
same, it's just not physical.
</P>
<P>
Put aside the relatively few among us who would go after hometown
Muslims with torches and ropes if they could. Most in the West
have been holding to the proposition that resident Muslims,
native or immigrant, are peaceable and that no fog of suspicion
should blanket them.
</P>
<P>
In that, we have abided by the steady and universal counsel of
western political and spiritual leadership.
</P>
<P>
After all, Islamist terrorists have been mostly young, variously
disaffected, indifferently educated, to whom the innate
discipline of reason is not second nature, or even third. Muslim,
yes, usually Middle Eastern, yet a breed apart.
</P>
<P>
But what is more reason-driven than medicine? It is rational,
pragmatic, empirical: Rigorous cause-and-effect stuff at every
turn.
</P>
<P>
The involvement of physicians in at least two countries - and the
emerging suggestion that an Internet web may lead to even more -
sets off a terrible dissonance, beyond the obvious one of men
trained to heal and comfort choosing instead to maim and
terrorize.
</P>
<P>
It's the social dissonance that so wounds.
</P>
<P>
If physicians can be - indeed, are - terrorists, are there then
no havens for Muslim and non-Muslim alike from categorical
probation? With any hope of brotherhood already reduced to
tolerance, and that often uneasy, are we to slip into mutually
wary estrangement? May no supposition of innocence stand?
</P>
<P>
The doctors' car bombs failed. It is not clear that their
terrorism did.
