KRouge foreign minister denied release before trial

<P>
Cambodia's UN-backed genocide court on Friday denied former Khmer
Rouge foreign minister Ieng Sary release from jail before he
faces trial for war crimes.
</P>
<P>
Ieng Sary, 82, who appeared at the court wearing a blue shirt
buttoned to the collar, had appealed to be let out of detention
on the grounds that he was granted a pardon for a 1979 genocide
conviction, and that the jail at the court did not have
facilities to care for his frail health.
</P>
<P>
But Judge Prak Kimsan rejected Ieng Sary's appeal, saying that
his previous amnesty did not apply to the UN-backed court.
</P>
<P>
"Provisional detention is a necessary measure to ensure the
security of the charged person, the presence of the charged
person at proceedings and to preserve public order," Prak Kimsan
said.
</P>
<P>
Ieng Sary is one of five senior leaders scheduled to be tried for
crimes committed during the Khmer Rouge regime, which killed 1.7
million people by torture, execution, overwork and starvation
during its 1975 to 1979 rule.
