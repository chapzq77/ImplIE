Earthlink Inc. says it will study the performance of its citywide
wireless Internet networks in four cities -- Philadelphia, New
Orleans and California's Anaheim and Milpitas -- before deciding
how to move forward with similar municipal Wi-Fi networks
elsewhere in the U.S.

While more cities are expressing interest in striking deals with
the company, Earthlink is "not yet able to establish that comfort
level" that the investments are really profitable, Kevin Dotts,
chief financial officer for the Atlanta-based company, said
Thursday.

<P>
That doesn't mean Earthlink is pulling the plug on cities under
contract, like Houston, which would eventually be the nation's
largest network at about 600 square miles (1,550 sq. kilometers),
Dotts said. Instead, the company wants to review a range of
factors to determine where it would be most profitable to invest
what Dotts estimates are up to $40 million a year in capital
expenditure.

<P>
Factors include topography -- less dense cities like Atlanta are
harder to cover; concentration of households; and alternative
revenues like electronic gas reading services, Dotts said. He
added the company will closely study the four designated markets
over the next few months before defining its strategy. He said it
will probably focus any expansion on large metropolitan areas
like Chicago.

Also Thursday, Earthlink announced it posted a loss of $29.9
million, or 24 cents per share, in the latest period. A year ago,
it had reported earnings of $16.3 million, or 12 cents per share.
