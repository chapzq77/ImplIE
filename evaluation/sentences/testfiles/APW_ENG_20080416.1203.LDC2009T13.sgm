With a wounded left knee, Woods has surgery and sits

The U.S. Open figured to be the closest to a sure thing for Tiger
Woods in the majors this year, but maybe not anymore.
</P>
<P>
Two days after his quest for a Grand Slam fizzled at the Masters,
Woods had arthroscopic surgery on his left knee for the second
time in five years and will miss at least four weeks while he
recovers.
</P>
<P>
The announcement, which Woods made Tuesday night on his Web site,
was a surprise to everyone except those around him.
</P>
<P>
"He's been having a lot of trouble," swing coach Hank Haney said.
"He doesn't talk about stuff like that. He doesn't want to use
excuses, you know? I don't think it affected his play. It
affected his practice a little bit."
</P>
<P>
The surgery was performed in Park City, Utah, by Thomas
Rosenberg, who also operated on Woods' left knee in December
2002. Woods also had surgery in 1994 on his left knee to remove a
benign tumor.
</P>
<P>
"I made the decision to deal with the pain and schedule the
surgery for after the Masters," Woods said on his Web site. "The
upside is that I have been through this process before and know
how to handle it. I look forward to working through the
rehabilitation process and getting back to action as quickly as I
can."
</P>
<P>
But he will not be able to defend his title in two weeks at the
Wachovia Championship. And he most likely will miss The Players
Championship the week after, one of only three non-majors he has
never missed since turning pro. Provided rehab goes as expected,
Woods hopes to return at the Memorial on May 29.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Open begins June 12 at Torrey Pines, where Woods has won
six times in the Buick Invitational. Such is his dominance on the
cliffside course north of San Diego that when he opened with a 67
on the South Course this year, a caddie standing behind the 18th
green remarked, "He just won two tournaments with one round."
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Woods went on to an eight-shot victory in his 2008 debut,
the first of four straight victories this year.
</P>
<P>
But it was not necessarily a pain-free affair.
</P>
<P>
"Tiger has been experiencing pain in his knee since the middle of
last year, and when he had it looked at by his doctors,
arthroscopic surgery was recommended," said Mark Steinberg,
Woods' agent at IMG. "Tiger has played through the pain in the
past, but knew it would be better for him to have the procedure
done as early as possible."
</P>
<P>
Steinberg said the surgery repaired cartilage damage. The 2002
surgery drained fluid from around the anterior cruciate ligament
and removed a benign cyst.
</P>
<P>
Woods was limping and wincing toward the end of the '02 season,
and it was not surprising to find out he had surgery that kept
him out two months, most of that over the holidays.
</P>
<P>
This time, it only made sense upon reviewing the past nine
months.
</P>
<P>
Woods stumbled and grimaced ever so slightly at Southern Hills
last August in the PGA Championship, when he chipped in for
birdie behind the eighth green in the final round and backpedaled
for a fist pump. In the final two PGA Tour events, in Chicago and
Atlanta, he occasionally would press his left foot against a
cooler, presumably to stretch his knee.
</P>
<P>
But it sure didn't affect his golf, not even at the Masters,
where he finished three shots behind Trevor Immelman.
</P>
<P>
"He hit 14 greens in regulation on Sunday," Haney said. "Hard to
say it was the knee."
</P>
<P>
Woods won the Bridgestone Invitational and PGA Championship in
consecutive weeks, then tied for second behind Phil Mickelson at
the Deutsche Bank Championship. That was his last loss until late
March, the longest winning streak of his career, which covered
five PGA Tour events, the Dubai Desert Classic on the European
Tour, and his unofficial Target World Challenge in December.
</P>
<P>
"I knew he was going to do something this year," Haney said,
referring to surgery. "I just didn't know when."
</P>
<P>
Woods has a remarkable track record when returning from a long
layoff. After the '02 surgery, he won three of his first four
events, including an 11-shot victory at Bay Hill.
</P>
<P>
This will be the second time in two years, however, that he
missed a chunk of time between the Masters and the U.S. Open. He
sat out nine weeks in 2006 to cope with the May death of his
father, not returning until the U.S. Open at Winged Foot. He
missed the cut for the only time in a major since he turned pro.
</P>
<P>
Torrey Pines is more familiar turf, even if the setup for the
U.S. Open will be vastly different. Woods won the Buick
Invitational this year for the third straight time, and he also
won there as a junior.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, his absence is a blow to the Wachovia
Championship and to The Players Championship, regarded as the
fifth major.
</P>
<P>
"Of course, we're disappointed when Tiger is unable to compete in
a PGA Tour event," commissioner Tim Finchem said on the tour's
Web site. "There is really never a good time for an athlete --
especially one of Tiger's caliber -- to take weeks off from
competition during the season. But his health concerns have to
come first."
</P>
<P>
Of greater concern might be the fact Woods has gone through
surgery twice on the same knee in five years. He has looked
immortal at times on the golf course, already winning 64 times on
the PGA Tour and 13 majors, second only to Jack Nicklaus.
</P>
<P>
Could this slow the pursuit?
</P>
<P>
Woods won 30 times and five majors since his last surgery, and
Haney expects nothing less.
</P>
<P>
"This is something he's already used to," Haney said. "He deals
with stuff incredibly, like you would expect him to."
