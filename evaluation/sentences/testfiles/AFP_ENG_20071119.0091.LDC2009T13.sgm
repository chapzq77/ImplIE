Europe to hand Mugabe tough message at summit: EU sources
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The EU's Portuguese presidency on Monday vowed to deliver a
"tough and clear message" to Zimbabwean leader Robert Mugabe at
an EU-Africa summit in Lisbon next month, European sources said.
</P>
<P>
Foreign ministers from the 27 European Union member states,
meeting in Brussels, considered how to deal with the possible
presence of Mugabe at the summit on December 8-9.
</P>
<P>
If the Zimbabwean president does turn up then British Prime
Minister Gordon Brown has vowed that neither he nor any senior
cabinet member will attend the second EU-Africa summit, because
of human rights abuses in the southern African nation.
</P>
<P>
If the veteran Zimbabwean leader does attend in Lisbon "there
should be a very clear and detailed conversation about Mugabe's
behaviour, abuse of human rights and his general unacceptable
reactionary way in which he is mismanaging his country and
abusing his citizens," Britain's European Affairs minister Jim
Murphy told reporters after the talks
</P>
<P>
"It is the UK's view, however, that Mugabe shouldn't be attending
the summit," he added.
</P>
<P>
Another British official stressed that "our position is
unchanged.... If he does turn up then the prime minister won't
attend and neither will any senior minister."
</P>
<P>
A European source said that "some member states want a real
discussion on human rights and governance in Zimbabwe," while
adding that most European capitals would prefer it if Mugabe
decides not to accept the invitation to the Lisbon meeting.
</P>
<P>
Luis Amado, foreign minister of Portugal which currently holds
the EU's rotating presidency, promised his fellow EU ministers
that there would be a robust debate in Mugabe's presence if he
did attend.
</P>
<P>
"We will organise a debate which will deliver a tough and clear
message," Amado was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
He later told a press conference that the EU would send an
observer mission to the region to discuss "the appropriate
attitude to adopt".
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe said Monday it had put its military on high alert
against a possible British invasion after the former armed forces
chief of its old colonial master revealed London had considered
such a move.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe's relations with Britain were strained after the south
African nation launched controversial land reforms in 2000,
seizing farms from white farmers -- the majority of them of
British descent -- to give to black farmers.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe was one of Tony Blair's most virulent critics before the
British premier stood down in June, frequently accusing him of
trying to force regime change and telling him to "keep his pink
nose" out of Zimbabwe's internal politics.
</P>
<P>
However, African leaders have largely defended Mugabe's right to
attend the EU- Africa summit, seven years after the first such
summit was held.
</P>
<P>
German Chancellor Angela Merkel was among the EU leaders who has
backed Mugabe's participation, saying the summit would be an
opportunity to "raise all our criticisms" about the "disaster" in
Zimbabwe.
