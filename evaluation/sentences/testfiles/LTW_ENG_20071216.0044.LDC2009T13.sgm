Troop Reduction to Focus on Ouylying Areas of Iraq
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The change represents the military's first attempt to confront
its big challenge in 2008: how to reduce the number of troops
without sacrificing security.
</P>
<P>
The shift in deployment strategy, described by senior U.S.
military officials in Iraq and Washington, D.C., is based on
concerns that despite recent improvements, the capital could
erupt again into widespread violence without an imposing American
military presence.
</P>
<P>
A year ago, when U.S. patrols in Baghdad were sparse and
sectarian killings were spiraling out of control, the troop
buildup was proposed in part to establish order in the capital.
Over the last four months, violence in the capital has begun to
abate.
</P>
<P>
But the most significant improvements have been in outlying
areas, where the first surge troops arrived at the start of the
year, followed by gradual improvements in Baghdad. Planners at
first thought it would be the other way around.
</P>
<P>
"There was a sense we would focus very significantly on Baghdad
and change would come from Baghdad-out," said a senior military
official in Washington, who like others spoke on condition of
anonymity when discussing troop strategy. "What we are seeing is
just the opposite, it is probably outside-in, toward Baghdad."
</P>
<P>
The withdrawals are occurring over the next eight months as the
troop surge that President Bush ordered last January gradually
comes to an end. Plans call for reducing troops that reached a
peak of about 170,000 to pre-buildup levels of about 135,000.
</P>
<P>
The new planning is not without risk and controversy. The change
in U.S. deployment strategy probably will shift the balance of
political power in the country by putting much greater authority
over provincial affairs in the hands of local and regional
officials. That will increase the influence of the local and
provincial governments and offset the authority of the Shiite-
dominated central government.
</P>
<P>
In addition, some of the early troop reductions will take place
in areas such as Anbar province, the site of raging insurgency in
the recent past.
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, the international military pullback from outlying
areas is under way. On Sunday, the British will hand over
authority for Basra and the south to the Iraqi government. Next,
U.S. officers expect to hand over western provinces to Iraqi
control, including Anbar, followed by still-precarious provinces
north of Baghdad, say military leaders in Washington and Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The new U.S. military view worries officials in the Shiite-
dominated central government who fear their power will be
diminished. The Shiite officials have expressed concern over U.S.
plans to hand over security responsibilities to recently
recruited police forces, particularly in Sunni strongholds such
as Anbar where the new police forces are mostly Sunni.
</P>
<P>
But the day-to-day commander in Iraq, Army Lt. Gen. Raymond T.
Odierno, and his staff believe the increasing competence of
provincial security and political leaders will put pressure on
the government in Baghdad that "will breed a better central
government," said his chief of staff, Brig. Gen. Joseph Anderson.
</P>
<P>
"There are different schools of thought here," Anderson said in
an interview in his office at the U.S. military headquarters at
Camp Victory. "Our school of thought is provincial capacity will
ultimately lead to enhanced central government capacity. That's
our view."
</P>
<P>
Months ago, Bush administration officials and senior military
leaders largely gave up hope of meaningful political
reconciliation through Iraq's central government. Instead,
officials have pinned their hopes on incremental progress at the
provincial level. As a consequence, Odierno's plan enjoys broad
support.
</P>
<P>
"The grass-roots level will force change at the top because if
they do not act on it, they will get overrun," said another
senior military officer responsible for Iraq war planning.
</P>
<P>
So far, military officials have sought to design the troop
reduction in a way that avoids creation of security gaps.But by
the spring, when the number of U.S. brigades in Iraq is reduced
from the current 19 to 17, significant turnovers of security
responsibility in outlying provinces are inevitable, Odierno said
in an interview. Those turnovers should accelerate the shift away
from a pure counterinsurgency strategy. Military leaders in
Washington have been pressing generals in Baghdad to move toward
what they call "tactical overwatch." Under that strategy, Iraqi
troops would take the lead in most operations, and U.S. troops
would be called in only when problems occur.
</P>
<P>
A faster move toward an "overwatch" strategy has gained adherents
as U.S. officials try to draw lessons from the experience of the
British in Basra, the largest city in the south, which will
become the first sector of the country outside the semi-
autonomous Kurdistan enclave in the north to be handed over to
the Iraqi government and security forces.
</P>
<P>
"You cannot set zero violence as your standard in Iraq. It is
just not attainable," the senior military official in Washington,
D.C., said. "The standard rather is a level of violence that is
containable by the Iraqi security forces. And that is largely
what we have seen in Basra."
</P>
<P>
For the Americans, the first real test of how well security can
hold up as the drawdown intensifies this spring probably will
take place in the north.
</P>
<P>
Significant violence still plagues Diyala province and its
provincial capital, Baqubah. Military planners are grappling with
a solution to deal with the instability in the region.
</P>
<P>
Some senior commanders believe violence in the northern provinces
are the result of a spillover of Sunni radicals linked to al-
Qaida in Iraq who have fled their former stronghold of Anbar,
where a U.S.-Iraqi alliance has all but shut down their
operations. Under such an analysis, additional combat operations
might be needed.
</P>
<P>
But at least one aide to Odierno, who spoke on the condition of
anonymity, said the violence appears more likely to be tied to
ongoing sectarian disputes in the region over the eventual
boundaries of the Kurdistan region. Such disputes need to be
resolved through sectarian reconciliation and not military
action, the aide said.
</P>
<P>
U.S. military officials insisted the focus on Baghdad is not
indicative of a lack of success in the capital. Violence is down
significantly, they note, and services are being restored.
</P>
<P>
But American generals also acknowledged that sectarian tensions
still plague the capital. For example, public services provided
by the central government are aimed largely at Shiite
neighborhoods at the expense of Sunni areas. In addition, the
multiethnic makeup of the capital makes it the most difficult
part of the country to achieve reconciliation between once-
warring factions.
</P>
<P>
Army Brig. Gen. Vincent Brooks, assistant commander for the
military headquarters responsible for Baghdad, said the Iraqi
central government is less willing to take a risk in the capital,
worried that a dramatic reduction in the U.S. forces could
quickly reignite security problems.
</P>
<P>
"Baghdad will be last," Brooks said, "because it's the capital
and because it's the most complex."
