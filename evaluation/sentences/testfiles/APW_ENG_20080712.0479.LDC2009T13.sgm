MOGADISHU, Somalia 2008-07-12 17:02:39 UTC

Unknown gunmen shot and killed two Somali aid workers and wounded
a third within 24 hours, witnesses said Saturday, in the latest
sign of spiraling violence against workers struggling to deal
with the war-ravaged country's humanitarian crisis.
</P>
<P>
The shootings all occurred within a few hours of each other on
Friday. Two men were shot in separate incidents about 8 miles (13
kilometers) from the capital of Mogadishu. One, who worked for an
aid organization affiliated with the U.N.'s World Food Program,
is in serious condition.

The other, Mohamed Mohamud Qeyre, died, said colleague Ahmed
Mo'alim. Qeyre was the deputy director of local aid group Daryeel
Bulsho Guud, which is affiliated to the German organization Bread
for the World.

<P>
"Two men shot him three times in the head and the ribs," said
Mo'alim.
</P>
<P>
In a third incident, local clan elder Ahmed Shire Yabar says aid
worker Mohamud Ahmed Roble was killed in Galharei town in central
Somalia. He said Saturday he did not know the name of the
organization the victim worked for.

<P>
"He was going to a mosque and he stepped out of his home; two men
armed with pistols shot him four times and escaped. He died on
the spot," said Yabar.

Violence against aid workers in Somalia has dramatically
increased in the past few weeks. One senior Somali aid worker for
the U.N. was kidnapped last month, and another shot dead July 6.
A driver for the U.N. World Food Program was killed at a
checkpoint on Monday, and Friday's shootings brings the total
number of aid workers shot this week to five.
</P>
<P>
It is unclear who is behind the killings, since many factions in
Somalia's chaotic war stand to benefit from them. Powerful local
leaders have previously complained that aid workers are feeding
Islamic insurgents who had sworn to fight the government, and
insurgents have also targeted Somalis affiliated with foreign
organizations in the past. The problem has been compounded by the
growth of professional kidnapping rings, who security experts say
have been encouraged by the large cash ransoms paid by foreigners
to release ships taken by pirates.

<P>
The Islamists vowed to fight an Iraq-style war against the
government and its Ethiopian allies in December 2006, after
Ethiopian troops dislodged the Islamists from the capital and
much of the territory in southern Somalia they had held for the
previous six months.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of civilians have been killed in the fighting and
hundreds of thousands have fled the capital. Over 2 million
people in the arid, impoverished country are dependent on food
aid. Control of aid, used to buy loyalty from militiamen, has
often provoked fighting among Somalia's powerful clan-based
warlords since they toppled a socialist dictator in 1991. The
country has not had a functioning government since then.
