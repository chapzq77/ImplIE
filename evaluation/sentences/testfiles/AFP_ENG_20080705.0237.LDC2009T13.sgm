Tibet exiles disappointed by China talks: Dalai Lama envoy
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Representatives of the Dalai Lama and China made no headway on
the status of Tibet in formal talks this week, an envoy of the
spiritual leader said Saturday, describing himself as
"disappointed.""There is a growing perception among the Tibetans
and my friends that the whole tactic of the Chinese government is
to engage us to stall for time," said Lodi Gyari, who led the
two-man team which met Chinese officials in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
"My colleague and I told our Chinese counterpart candidly that we
ourselves are beginning to inch towards this school of thought."
</P>
<P>
Gyari and Kelsang Gyaltsen met with a series of Chinese officials
on Tuesday and Wednesday for the seventh round of a dialogue
process that was started in 2002 but broke off last year.
</P>
<P>
Beijing agreed to restart the dialogue amid world criticism of
its massive crackdown on deadly anti-Chinese riots that engulfed
the Tibetan capital Lhasa in spring and spread across the Tibetan
plateau.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing talks followed an informal meeting in May, also in
China.
</P>
<P>
The Dalai Lama, who has said he opposes Tibetan independence, has
called for "real and meaningful autonomy" for the region and an
end to what he has said are widespread human rights violations
against his people.
</P>
<P>
"We had hoped that the Chinese leadership would reciprocate our
efforts by taking tangible steps during this round," said Gyari,
after a briefing in the Tibetan exile enclave of Dharamshala, in
India's Himalayan foothills.
</P>
<P>
"On the contrary, due to their excessive concern about legitimacy
the Chinese side even failed to agree to our proposal of issuing
a joint statement with the aim of committing both parties to the
dialogue process."
</P>
<P>
Gyari said the stance of the Chinese government had cast doubt on
the benefit of continuing the talks.
</P>
<P>
"We were compelled to candidly convey to our counterparts that in
the absence of serious and sincere commitment on their part the
continuation of the present dialogue process would serve no
purpose," he said.
</P>
<P>
But the envoys have agreed to at least one more round of talks in
October, after Beijing hosts the Olympics in August, to gauge
China's level of commitment in resolving concerns over Tibet, he
said.
</P>
<P>
China's opponents accuse it of systematic political, cultural and
religious oppression in the remote and devoutly Buddhist
Himalayan region.
</P>
<P>
Beijing has accused the Dalai Lama of fomenting unrest in the
Tibetan region that erupted on March 14 after four days of
peaceful protests against Chinese rule.
</P>
<P>
China has ruled Tibet since 1951, a year after sending troops in
to "liberate" the region.
