Football: Capello upbeat despite England's reality Czech by Steve
Griffiths
</HEADLINE>

Fabio Capello insists England are ready for next month's World
Cup qualifiers despite his side's lacklustre display in a 2-2
draw against the Czech Republic.Capello's final dress rehersal
ahead of September's crucial ties against Andorra and Croatia
didn't go according to plan as the team were booed off at an
underwhelmed Wembley on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The reaction would have been even worse if Joe Cole hadn't
scrambled home an equaliser deep into stoppage time to deny the
Czechs a first win at the English national stadium.
</P>
<P>
A trying 90 minutes for Capello had started with the shock news
that FA chief executive Brian Barwick - the man who hired the
Italian - would be stepping down at the end of the year after
losing a power struggle with chairman Lord Triesman.
</P>
<P>
As if that wasn't bad enough, Capello had to defend himself from
criticism by Portsmouth manager Harry Redknapp - commentating on
the match for a television channel - who claimed that the Italian
was "killing" Steven Gerrard by playing the Liverpool midfielder
on the left wing.
</P>
<P>
Capello hit back by insisting he had actually positioned Gerrard
more centrally and went on to highlight the few positives from a
dispiriting performance.
</P>
<P>
"Gerrard was not playing on the left, I'm sorry. We played
4-3-2-1. We played (Jermain) Defoe, Gerrard and (Wayne) Rooney
and three midfielders behind them," Capello said.
</P>
<P>
"The position he had to play was between the line of the backs
and the midfielders. Mr Redknapp has to say something but he
didn't play on the left. Sorry. With his movement - he went on
the left and to the middle - he moved but he never played on the
left.
</P>
<P>
"I'm happy for the draw because the reaction to the team to the
last minute was good, was important. And I think, also, that the
first half we played with good football, good style and created a
lot of chances to score goals. And the team played together with
different style.
</P>
<P>
"I think tonight we took another step. I'm happy. I saw a lot of
things which I had doubts on, and the players' fitness levels are
still not at their best but I think we'll be ready for both the
games next month."
</P>
<P>
Capello did concede that the Czechs had exposed England's
weakness against quick counter-attacks.
</P>
<P>
"There was only one thing I didn't like, in the first half:
sometimes, when the Czechs had counter-attacks, we suffered," he
said. "That was the problem. We have to prepare something to
combat that problem.
</P>
<P>
"I asked to play against them for this reason - to see where the
problems are. They are not easy to beat."
</P>
<P>
John Terry, Capello's newly appointed captain, looked strangely
hesitant for much of the match and was at fault for Milan Baros's
opener.
</P>
<P>
But the Chelsea defender gave an honest assessment of the
performance and warned his team-mates they will have to improve
by September.
</P>
<P>
"I think overall we expected more from the game but there are
some positives and some negatives and we will sit down and
analyse them," Terry said.
</P>
<P>
"Maybe we should have won the game with the team we had there and
now there are two weeks to go to reassess the game before the
qualifying game against Andorra.
</P>
<P>
"Hopefully we can build on that and take the positives but things
(under Capello) will take time to get right.
</P>
<P>
"The crowd were frustrated and the players fully understand that
and we know we have to put on a better show."
</P>
<P>
England paid the price for a slow start when they fell behind in
the 22nd minute. Former Liverpool striker Baros caught Terry
flat-footed as he turned and drove in a shot that deflected home
off Ashley Cole.
</P>
<P>
Wes Brown brought England level on the stroke of half-time when
he headed home David Beckham's cross for his first international
goal.
</P>
<P>
Marek Jankulovski restored the Czechs' lead with a superb second
half free-kick before Cole allowed Capello to breathe a little
easier with a scrambled equaliser.
