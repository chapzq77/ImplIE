' THE FIRST SATURDAY IN MAY ' : INSIDE THE SPORT OF KINGS

There are a lot of horses but absolutely no sense in "The First
Saturday in May," a glib, lazy documentary about six trainers on
the proverbial road to the 2006 Kentucky Derby. This is, after
all, a movie about horse trainers that tells you next to nothing
about what horse trainers do besides stand around paddocks,
issuing vague instructions to the grooms or staring nervously,
wistfully and stoically at the racetrack. Do the trainers
determine a horse's feed or its racing schedule? Do they choose
the drugs that are regularly pumped into these magnificent
animals? Or do the owners make those calls? Don't look here for
answers.
</P>
<P>
These questions seem especially pertinent because one of the six
trainers is Michael Matz, who trained Barbaro. On May 6, 2006,
after having been raced only once in the previous 13 weeks,
Barbaro won the Derby by a thrillingly wide margin; two weeks
later he was run in the Preakness Stakes (the second race in the
Triple Crown), where he sustained the leg injury that eventually
led to his being euthanized. His death generated the usual
blather: one so-called expert noted that all sports entail risk,
while ignoring that it's only animals that also risk being put
down. But there was also some soul-searching from trainers and
sportswriters who wondered if thoroughbreds were unnecessarily
being placed in harm's way.
</P>
<P>
Barbaro was apparently on a legal diuretic when he was raced at
the Preakness. There is no evidence that drugs played a role in
his injury. Yet the debate over racing thoroughbreds on any drugs
is precisely the kind of issue that you would expect to be
addressed -- much less mentioned -- in a documentary that
features what would soon be the most famous dead horse in America
since Ruffian, the spectacular filly who was fatally injured in
1975. Horse racing is a sensationally exciting spectator sport,
of course, but it's also a troubled one filled with dirty little
half-kept secrets. Almost two horses die for every 1,000 starts
in this country, which adds up to a lot of dead animals.
</P>
<P>
In making this, their feature debut, the brothers John and Brad
Hennegan were not obliged to create a documentary about doping
and death in thoroughbred racing. But given that they don't
address even the basics of horse training in a movie about horse
trainers, you have to wonder what they thought they were making.
They clearly enjoy the company of the trainers, some of whom come
across rather better than others, notably Kiaran McLaughlin, who
trained Jazil, the winner of the 2006 Belmont Stakes, the third
leg of the Triple Crown. Yet the filmmakers remain strangely
incurious about these six men, who have all staked their careers
on expensive, scarily fragile, four-legged animals that they
don't own and, in some cases, seem basically indifferent to.
</P>
<P>
If Barbaro weren't one of the main attractions in "The First
Saturday in May," and if his name weren't being used in the
marketing, the movie's lapses might be forgivable. It would still
be a bad documentary, marred by dribbling camerawork and
pointless choices -- a ha-ha scene of one trainer golfing with
hard liquor and a fat cousin, filler images of Derby crowds in
wacky hats and far too many shots of the trainers staring into
the distance -- but it wouldn't smack of exploitation. Then
again, given that one of the movie's distributors is Churchill
Downs Inc., which owns and operates racetracks and is the host of
the Derby, it's no wonder that this feels like a feature-length
commercial for the horse racing industry. It is.
