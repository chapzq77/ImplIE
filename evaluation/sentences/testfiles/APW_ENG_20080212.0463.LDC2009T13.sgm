COLOMBO, Sri Lanka 2008-02-12 10:34:40 UTC

<P>
Artillery fired by Tamil separatists hit a Roman Catholic church
near a military base in Sri Lanka's embattled north Tuesday,
killing six soldiers who were cleaning the building, the military
said.
</P>
<P>
About 15 shells hit St. Anthony's Church and the nearby area in
the village of Thalladi in the Mannar district, military
spokesman Brig. Udaya Nanayakkara said.
</P>
<P>
He said the military undertook cleaning at the request of priests
who visited the church Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Rev. Victor Sosai said the military did not allow civilians
to worship in the church with military activity increasing in the
past two months.
</P>
<P>
The attack came a day after escalating fighting between
government forces and Tamil Tiger fighters along the front lines
of the civil war killed 42 rebels and 10 soldiers, the military
announced Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Rebel spokesman Rasiah Ilanthirayan could not immediately be
reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
Fighting has escalated around the rebel strongholds in the north
in recent months after the government vowed to dismantle the
rebel administration and crush their decades-old separatist
campaign.
</P>
<P>
The government earlier this year officially withdrew from a six-
year-old cease-fire with the rebels. The pact had been ignored by
both sides for the past two years.
</P>
<P>
Tamil Tiger rebels have fought the government since 1983 to
create a separate homeland for the country's ethnic minority
Tamils.
</P>
<P>
More than 70,000 people have been killed in the conflict.
