You may never get a date with Pamela Anderson, but now you can
buy her used linens, old clothes and a chair she once sat in.
</P>
<P>
Anderson was holding a weekend estate sale in Malibu, offering
French country furniture, chandeliers, jewelry, antique toys,
dirt bikes and other items, including a Chrysler electric car,
according to an Internet flyer from Helping Hand Estate Sale
Service, which was coordinating the sale.
</P>
<P>
The company set up a pink Web page detailing the sale and
headlined with a cartoon blonde straddling the word "Pamela."
</P>
<P>
The sale was scheduled through Sunday at a Malibu site that is
not Anderson's home. The notice did not indicate whether the
former "Baywatch" star would be there.
</P>
<P>
A call to Anderson's publicist seeking comment was not
immediately returned Saturday.
</P>
<P>
It's not the only spring cleaning for Anderson, 40. Her brief
marriage to Rick Salomon was annulled in March.
