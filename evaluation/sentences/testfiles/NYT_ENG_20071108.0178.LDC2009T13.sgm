ISRAEL PRESSING EGYPT ON HAMAS MOVES MONA EL-NAGGAR CONTRIBUTED
REPORTING FROM CAIRO, AND DAVID HERSZENHORN FROM WASHINGTON.

Israel says Egypt is doing far too little to stop the Palestinian
Islamist group Hamas, which controls the Gaza Strip, from
smuggling weapons, militants and cash into the area from Egypt,
and is appealing to Cairo to do more.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, a senior Israeli legislator from the opposition
Likud bloc who is close to the security services is lobbying the
U.S. Senate to withhold some military aid to Egypt unless it
takes action.
</P>
<P>
The legislator, Yuval Steinitz, has written to all U.S. senators
to encourage them to support a move begun in the House of
Representatives to freeze $200 million of a projected $1.3
billion in military aid to Egypt. Steinitz said he was asked to
write the letter by senators he met as a leader, with Sen. Jon
Kyl, R-Ariz., of a joint group on defense that meets twice a
year.
</P>
<P>
The House bill would freeze the $200 million until the secretary
of state certified that Egypt "has taken concrete and measurable
steps" to enact a law protecting the independence of the
judiciary, to "curb police abuses" by providing training for
police leadership and to "detect and destroy the smuggling
network and smuggling tunnels that lead from Egypt to Gaza." The
Senate version urges Egypt to do more to stop smuggling but would
not halt aid.
</P>
<P>
In his letter, Steinitz, former chairman of the Israeli
Parliament's Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee and chairman
of the security subcommittee, accuses Egypt of allowing Hamas to
obtain 20,000 rifles, 6,000 anti-tank missiles, 100 tons of
explosives, several dozen Katyusha rockets and shoulder-held
anti-aircraft missiles every year.
</P>
<P>
In the last three months, Steinitz says, Egypt has allowed "the
organized departure of large groups of operatives from Gaza for
military training in Iran." In September, he notes, 100 Gazans
who had trained in Iran were allowed by Egypt to return home
despite Israeli protests.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian authorities say the accusations are inaccurate and aimed
at sabotaging Egyptian-U.S. relations. They say that they have
done all they can to try to safeguard the border, but are
hamstrung by the 1979 Camp David agreement, which restricts the
number of soldiers they can deploy there.
</P>
<P>
"Egypt can't have a real security presence on the border," said
Fouad Allam, former director of Egyptian State Security. "Egypt
tried to amend this, and Israel refused."
</P>
<P>
Steinitz's assessments track those of the Israeli military and
military intelligence. His complaints are shared by the Israeli
government. Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni on Tuesday told her
Egyptian counterpart, Ahmed Aboul Gheit, that "there is a real
need for a determined effort to stop weapons smuggling into the
Gaza Strip."
</P>
<P>
But the government does not associate itself with the Steinitz
letter or its call to freeze aid to Egypt, which, like Jordan,
has a formal peace treaty with Israel.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. House move was led by Reps. Gary Ackerman and Nita M.
Lowey, both D-N.Y., who are strong supporters of Israel.
</P>
<P>
Ackerman is chairman of the subcommittee on the Middle East and
Asia; Lowey is chairwoman of the state and foreign operations
subcommittee of the Appropriations Committee.
</P>
<P>
Ackerman told the newspaper Haaretz that Egypt had been allowing
between $12 million and $20 million a month in cash to flow to
Hamas, and said smuggling had worsened. "Egypt is not helping as
much as it can," he said.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has sent senior officials and military officers to
Washington to argue against the freeze and to describe their
efforts to stop the smuggling. In a document given to
legislators, Egypt suggested that some Israeli soldiers were
helping smugglers.
</P>
<P>
The Bush administration opposes withholding aid.  (BEGIN OPTIONAL
TRIM)
</P>
<P>
A Senate foreign-policy aide, who spoke on condition of anonymity
because of the delicate nature of negotiations in Congress, said
the Senate seemed unlikely to back withholding aid because it
does not wish to signal a weakening of support when Egypt has a
crucial role in the Middle East peace effort. But the aide said
the issue would have to be resolved in a conference committee.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Egypt said that it had uncovered another six
smuggling tunnels and destroyed them; it announced the
destruction of others on the eve of U.S. Secretary of State
Condoleezza Rice's last trip there.
</P>
<P>
Months ago, just after Hamas took control of Gaza, men in the
border town of Rafah who had identified themselves as smugglers
said that when smugglers were caught ferrying goods or weapons
into Gaza, they were treated more leniently by judges who were
sympathetic to the Palestinian cause. They also said that
security guards at the border could be persuaded to look the
other way for money.
</P>
<P>
Overall, Egypt's relationship with Hamas is complicated by
domestic political concerns. On one hand, analysts said, it is
not in Egypt's interest to improve relations with Hamas, an
offshoot of the banned Muslim Brotherhood. On the other, Egypt
does not want to be seen to be helping Israel over the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
"I do not think that Egypt is re-examining its relationship with
Hamas, because any legitimacy for Hamas negatively affects the
legitimacy of the Egyptian regime," said Emad Gad, an analyst at
the Ahram Center for Political and Strategic Studies in Cairo.
"Any success for Hamas is a success for the Muslim Brotherhood."
</P>
<P>
When Egypt opened its border with Gaza in September to allow
Hamas militants to pass through, analysts in Egypt said that it
was likely part of some deal, but that politically, they had no
choice. Newspapers in Egypt reported that Hamas turned over a
wanted Qaida militant in exchange for the passage, a deal the
government never confirmed.
</P>
<P>
"This would be a political crisis for Egypt," Gad said. "People
will say that Egypt is cooperating with Israel against the
Palestinians. And Egypt can not do this."
</P>
<P>
Analysts added that Egypt has cultivated an unofficial
relationship with Hamas partly because it is such a large force
that it can not be ignored and partly in the hope of bringing
greater unity between Hamas and Fatah.
