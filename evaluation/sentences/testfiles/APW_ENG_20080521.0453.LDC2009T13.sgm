Survey: German business confidence unexpectedly rises in May

FRANKFURT, Germany 2008-05-21 09:21:22 UTC

<P>
German business confidence posted an unexpected increase for May,
retreating from the more than two-year low set a month earlier
and indicating that companies have so far weathered record euro
and oil prices, a closely watched survey showed Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Ifo institute's index rose to 103.5 points in May compared
with 102.4 points in April and 104.8 points in March, reflecting
concern about the record-setting euro and soaring oil prices.
</P>
<P>
The reading was better than the 101.9 points that analysts by Dow
Jones Newswires had forecast.
</P>
<P>
"On the whole, the dampening of economic activity in Germany in
the months following the very good first quarter should be
moderate," the institute said of the results, gathered from
polling of 7,000 firms in Germany.
</P>
<P>
A subindex measuring managers' six-month outlook edged upward to
97.3 points from 96.8 points in April.
</P>
<P>
Managers' assessment of their current economic situation also
rose for the second time in four months. That subindex increased
to 110.1 points from 108.4 points in April.
</P>
<P>
"The renewed surprising upward movement in the Ifo business
climate underscores that the German economy is currently better
positioned than most of its European neighbors," said Alexander
Koch, vice president and economist with UniCredit in Munich.
</P>
<P>
However, he warned that the German economy, Europe's biggest, was
not invulnerable.
</P>
<P>
"The German economy won't escape unscathed from the global
economic downturn," he said. "Despite the current rise, the trend
in the important expectations component points south and
currently signals a softening in the growth dynamic to around
potential by the second half of this year, with the outlook for
expectations skewed to the downside in the months ahead."
</P>
<P>
Ifo's report found that manufacturing companies were still
planning moderate increases in employment, in part because
"export opportunities continued to be appraised as good," the
Munich-based agency said. Though it conceded that "firms are not
quite as optimistic as in the previous month."
</P>
<P>
Timo Klein, an analyst with Global Insight in Frankfurt, said the
report's findings "were relatively uniform across sectors this
time."
</P>
<P>
"The wholesale and retail sectors both recovered after April's
declines, driven by a more favorable assessment of their current
situation but also by improved expectations," he said. "Retail
expectations in particular remain clearly better than in late
2007, so that an improving trend for German consumer demand
during the remainder of 2008 is becoming increasingly likely."
</P>
<P>
The report was opposite of the latest survey of German investor
confidence, which declined for a second straight month.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the ZEW institute's monthly index of investors'
expectations for the German economy over the next six months
dropped to minus 41.4 points in May from minus 40.7 points in
April. The decline was worse than the minus 37 points analysts
polled by Dow Jones Newswires had predicted. The historical
average is plus 29.6 points.
