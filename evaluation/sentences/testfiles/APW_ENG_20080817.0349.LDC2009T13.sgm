Kaori Icho of Japan has repeated as the Olympic women's
63-kilogram wrestling gold medalist, defeating Alena Kartashova
of Russia on Sunday by winning each of the two periods in
overtime.
</P>
<P>
Icho, who has won every world championship in her weight class
since 2002, is the younger sister of two-time 48 kg silver
medalist Chiharu Icho.
</P>
<P>
The bronzes were won by Randi Miller of the United States, and
Yelena Shalygina of Kazakhstan.
</P>
<P>
The second overtime took only four seconds as, after a scoreless
period, Icho went into the lockup position and grabbed Kartashova
around the left knee to dump her to the mat for the decisive two-
point takedown.
</P>
<P>
Hardly a stunner. Icho and teammate Saori Yoshida are the world's
dominant women's wrestlers, with two Olympic golds apiece,
Yoshida at 55 kg, in as many games since the sport gained Olympic
recognition.
</P>
<P>
There was a surprise -- Miller, wrestling in her first world-
level senior international tournament for the United States, and
Yelena Shalygina of Kazakhstan won the bronzes.
</P>
<P>
Icho said she wouldn't have won either gold without her sister.
</P>
<P>
No doubt she was trying to ease the disappointment big sister
felt by again not being able to match her sister's gold.
</P>
<P>
"I've been training hard with her the last four years," Icho
said. "I think I can do it because I've been training with her. I
told Chiharu the gold medal is for her, too."
</P>
<P>
If Icho is to go for a third gold, it may be up to her sister,
too.
</P>
<P>
Kaori Icho said if her 26-year-old sister wants to work toward
London in 2012, she will, too. If not ...
</P>
<P>
"I'm not sure if I want to compete by myself. If Chiharu will go,
I should say I will go," she said.
</P>
<P>
Miller beat out 2002 silver medalist Sara McMann to make the U.S.
team and, while she didn't match her medal, she won only the
second medal in 10 weight classes by a U.S. wrestler in Beijing.
Adam Wheeler, also a world-level senior tournament rookie, got a
bronze at 96 kg in Greco-Roman.
</P>
<P>
"This isn't what I came here for, but I'll take it and work hard
to get back," said the 24-year-old Miller, a former Dallas-area
high school wrestler whose career has taken off in the last year.
</P>
<P>
Ali Bernard, another U.S. rookie, reached one of the two bronze
medal matches at 72 kg but lost.
</P>
<P>
Miller, pinned in the quarterfinals by Icho, took down Canada's
Martine Dugrenier while trailing with 13 seconds remaining in the
third period for the decisive point.
</P>
<P>
"I was aware of how much time was left," Miller said. "I felt
better (in that match). There were a couple of times where I
stopped wrestling and I paid for it. I paid for it with two
points. I know myself, and I know I can wrestle better."
</P>
<P>
Miller won her first two matches before being overmatched against
Icho and losing 3-0, 6-0 in the best-of-three format, with the
second period stopped after Icho built up a six-point lead.
</P>
<P>
Miller got into the bronze medal bracket when Icho reached the
finals, and she beat Olesya Zamula of Azerbaijan 2-0, 3-0 in the
fourth of her five matches. By beating Dugrenier, Miller
prevented Canada from winning its third women's wrestling medal
in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The United States finished with one fewer women's mat medal than
it got in Athens, when McMann and Patricia Miranda (bronze at 48
kg) each medaled.
