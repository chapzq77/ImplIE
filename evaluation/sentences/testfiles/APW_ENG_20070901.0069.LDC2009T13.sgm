US presidential candidates focus on gay marriage after Iowa
ruling
</HEADLINE>

DES MOINES, Iowa 2007-09-01 00:36:45 UTC

<P>
A judge's decision to knock down a same-sex marriage ban in the
state of Iowa stirred up the U.S. presidential race as
Republicans jostled to stake out a position with the state's
conservative voters in mind.
</P>
<P>
Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney was the first to
seize on the ruling, promptly aligning himself with Iowa
political leaders in denouncing the decision.
</P>
<P>
The former Massachusetts governor's swift criticism served to
bolster the conservative image his campaign has been working hard
to promote to Iowa's Republican voters. Romney stressed his
support for a federal amendment that would ban same-sex marriage,
a stand that distinguishes him from his top rivals, who have said
they prefer to leave such decisions to the states.
</P>
<P>
"The ruling in Iowa ... is another example of an activist court
and unelected judges trying to redefine marriage and disregard
the will of the people as expressed through Iowa's Defense of
Marriage Act," Romney said in a statement shortly after the
ruling was made. "This once again highlights the need for a
Federal Marriage Amendment to protect the traditional definition
of marriage as between one man and one woman."
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Polk County Judge Robert Hanson, who ruled Thursday
that the state's decade-old ban on same-sex marriage was
unconstitutional, issued a stay on his own ruling. The stay
closed the window for any gay couples seeking to marry in Polk
County, which includes the state capital Des Moines.
</P>
<P>
But the decision inflamed an issue that is important to the
state's conservative Republican voters.
</P>
<P>
Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton was the first Democrat to offer a
reaction. Taping an appearance on "The Ellen DeGeneres Show"
Friday, Clinton said she favors civil unions "with full equality
of benefits." But she said the question of same-sex marriage
should be left up to the states.
</P>
<P>
"The states have always determined age of marriage, other
conditions and over time we've gotten rid of a lot of
discrimination that used to exist in marriage laws," she said.
"That's now happening. People are making decisions. Civil unions,
marriage. They're deciding in the states and I think that's the
appropriate place for that to be."
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Democrat Barack Obama said the senator "believes
these matters should be left to the states, which is why he
opposes the Defense of Marriage Act."
</P>
<P>
While most Democratic candidates have voiced support for same-sex
civil unions, they have declined to back gay marriage, a stance
that has created some tension with their gay supporters.
</P>
<P>
For Republicans, the task was not to offend conservatives.
</P>
<P>
Republican White House hopeful John McCain called the ruling "a
loss for the traditional family."
</P>
<P>
"I have always supported the traditional definition of marriage
as between one man and one woman," he said. "The ruling of the
court only reinforces my belief that we must have a president who
is committed to appointing strict constructionists to the bench."
</P>
<P>
Kansas Senator Sam Brownback, who has worked hard to gain the
backing of social conservatives in Iowa, offered a sharp
rejection of the judge's ruling.
</P>
<P>
"The people of Iowa reject the redefinition of marriage, and I
pledge today to defend the bond of marriage, as I have
consistently done in the past," he said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Jarrod Agen, a spokesman for Rudy Giuliani, said the former New
York mayor "believes marriage is between a man and a woman."
Giuliani has supported limited legal recognition for same-sex
couples.
</P>
<P>
"It's becoming increasingly clear why we need judges who
interpret the Constitution rather than legislate from the bench,"
Agen said. "It's the reason why Rudy is committed to appointing
strict constructionist judges in the vein of Alito, Roberts and
Scalia."
</P>
<P>
Former Senator Fred Thompson, who will officially enter the
presidential race next week, has offered support for a federal
amendment that would prevent states without gay marriage laws
from having to recognize same-sex marriages from other states.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Romney discussed the matter in a private conference
call with Iowa House Republican Leader Christopher Rants, who has
endorsed Romney, and Kris Mineau, president of the Massachusetts
Family Institute, which led the campaign against legalizing gay
marriages in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
Romney was governor of Massachusetts in 2003 when the state's
supreme court legalized same-sex marriages, making it the only
U.S. state to allow gay marriages. Romney criticized the court
decision, but was unsuccessful in efforts to push through a state
constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriages.
</P>
<P>
Later, campaigning in South Carolina, Romney said he would renew
his calls to amend the Constitution to ban same-sex marriage.
"That's essential to our future," he said.
</P>
<P>
While Romney is willing to generally leave it to states to decide
how to set up health care coverage plans, he said it should not
be left to states to decide same-sex marriage issues.
</P>
<P>
"It's a status that lasts a lifetime. And so, if somebody is
married in one state and they move to another state, that status
travels with them. And so, if you have gay marriage in one state,
whether you want it or not, you have gay marriage in all states,"
Romney told reporters after speaking at a Greenville, South
Carolina, restaurant.
</P>
<P>
Dianne Bystrom, director of the Carrie Chapman Catt Center for
Women and Politics at Iowa State University, said the ruling
could fire up social conservatives.
</P>
<P>
"It will probably stir up the social conservatives in the state
and make the climate better in Iowa for the most socially
conservative of the presidential candidates," she said. "That
would be most of them, except (Rudy) Giuliani, I guess."
</P>
<P>
She said Romney can use the issue to dispel any lingering doubts
about his commitment to social conservative causes.
</P>
<P>
"He's very much trying to establish himself with the social
conservatives in the state, who ... eye him somewhat suspiciously
as not being conservative enough because of being governor of
Massachusetts, which did allow gay marriages, and he switched his
position on reproductive choice," she said.
</P>
<P>
Dennis Goldford, a political scientist at Drake University in Des
Moines, said Giuliani could stress his opposition to same-sex
marriage to help reassure some conservatives who find his anti-
terrorism stance appealing but reject his past support for some
abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
"It gives Giuliani a chance to play," he said.
