HADITHA HEARING TOLD MARINE PREDISPOSED TO VIOLENCE
</HEADLINE>

CAMP PENDLETON, Calif.

A Marine sergeant offered gruesome testimony on Friday against a
former squad leader charged with killing 17 Iraqi civilians in
Haditha nearly two years ago, suggesting that the defendant,
Staff Sgt. Frank D. Wuterich, was predisposed to the violence,
carried it out ruthlessly and sought to cover it up.
</P>
<P>
The prosecution witness, Sgt. Sanick Dela Cruz, was ordered to
testify with immunity after murder charges against him for
killing five of the men were dismissed in April.
</P>
<P>
At the hearing, to determine whether the charges against Wuterich
should progress to a court-martial, Dela Cruz testified that
Wuterich shot five unarmed men as they stood behind a car, some
with their hands interlocked behind their heads in a surrender
posture, in the moments after the bomb exploded. He also said
Wuterich fired more rounds into the bodies of all five men as
they lay dead or dying near a car a short distance from the
attack.

<P>
Wuterich has said he shot the five men, but only after they ran
away, which he believed constituted a hostile act that allowed
him to use deadly force.
</P>
<P>
Dela Cruz told prosecutors that a week before the Haditha
episode, Wuterich had reacted to an earlier roadside bombing by
telling him and other Marines in the unit, "If we ever get hit
again, we should kill everybody in that area."
