FIVE BRITISH MUSLIMS GUILTY OF PLANNING BOMB ATTACKS

<P>
A jury found five British Muslim men guilty on Monday of planning
fertilizer-bomb attacks around London, ending a yearlong trial
that linked the plotters with two of the four men who blew
themselves up on London's transit system in July 2005.
</P>
<P>
According to the evidence, revealed during the trial but made
public for the first time, authorities had closely monitored
meetings in 2004 between members of the two plots but never fully
investigated the men who pulled off the transit attacks, which
killed 56 people 18 months later. To ensure a fair trial, the
judge had ordered the news media not to make the information
public until after the verdict.
</P>
<P>
The revelation turned a victory for British authorities into a
day of hand-wringing and recriminations over whether they had
missed an opportunity to prevent the deadliest terrorist attack
in the country's history.
</P>
<P>
Within an hour of the verdict, the opposition Conservative Party
and survivors and relatives of the victims of the transit attack
demanded an investigation into why the authorities did not act on
their surveillance.
</P>
<P>
The connection between the two groups, both in Britain and in
Pakistan, pointed to a level of organization among terrorist
cells here that initially had been seen as "homegrown" and
independent.
</P>
<P>
The two 2005 suicide bombers, like four of the five men convicted
on Monday, were British citizens of Pakistani origin. At least
some of the men in both plots were trained at military camps in
Pakistan that were suspected of connections to al-Qaida
operatives.
</P>
<P>
That law enforcement authorities knew of a connection between the
two groups is especially embarrassing because three days after
the July 2005 attacks, Charles Clarke, then the home secretary,
said the attack "simply came out of the blue."
</P>
<P>
The order of the judge, Sir Michael Astill, keeping the links
between the groups secret, was lifted on Monday, as the jury
delivered the verdicts after 27 days of deliberations.
</P>
<P>
The men were convicted of conspiracy to cause explosions by using
1,300 pounds of fertilizer stashed in a lock-up storage facility.
Six of the seven men on trial are of Pakistani descent; the five
who were convicted are British citizens.
</P>
<P>
Among their potential targets, the prosecution said, was a major
suburban shopping center, a busy London nightclub, known as the
Ministry of Sound, public utilities, and a British airliner, all
places mentioned by the plotters in conversations the authorities
had taped.
</P>
<P>
Astill sentenced the five convicted men to life imprisonment,
saying, "You have betrayed the country that has given you every
advantage in life."
