Japan's economy grew at an annualized rate of 2.6 percent in the
July-September quarter on strong exports, the government said
Tuesday, but the outlook for further exports was clouded by
sluggish economic signs in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Gross domestic product grew a price-adjusted 0.6 percent from the
previous quarter, according to preliminary data released by the
Cabinet Office. On an annualized basis, the July-September GDP
increased by 2.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
The figures beat the annualized 1.8 percent gain forecast by
economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires.
</P>
<P>
In the April-June quarter, Japan's GDP declined 1.2 percent on an
annual basis, marking the first contraction in growth for three
quarters.
</P>
<P>
Although the latest results suggest Japan's economy is still
recovering, there are also worrying signs.
</P>
<P>
Exports, which accounted for much of the third-quarter growth,
are at a risk of decelerating because of a slowdown in the U.S.
economy.
</P>
<P>
Another sign is that housing investment, though its contribution
is small, is declining. Private residential investment plunged
7.8 percent -- the largest drop since a 11.1 percent tumble in
the April-June 1997 quarter -- likely hurt by tighter building
regulations that came into force in late June.
</P>
<P>
That was the third straight quarter of declines, after a revised
4.1 percent fall in the April-June period.
</P>
<P>
Although housing investment accounts for only 3 percent of the
GDP, its decline is a cause for worry because it could hurt
factory output and business investment by cooling demand for
construction materials and durable goods such as refrigerators
and TVs.
</P>
<P>
Such a slowdown in internal demand would mean that the Bank of
Japan will likely have to wait until next year to lift short-term
interest rates from the current 0.5 percent level.
</P>
<P>
The data came before the central bank finishes its two-day
monetary policy meeting later Tuesday. Most analysts expect the
bank to leave short-term rates unchanged at 0.50 percent.
</P>
<P>
In the July-September period, consumer spending, which accounts
for more than half of Japan's GDP, rose 0.3 percent on quarter,
better than a revised 0.2 percent rise in the April-June period.
Solid sales in the travel industry attributed to the rise.
</P>
<P>
Business investment rose 1.7 percent, rebounding from a revised
2.1 percent decline in the April-June period. Companies bought
more general industrial machinery, according to the Cabinet
Office.
</P>
<P>
The data, meanwhile, indicate that Japan has so far withstood the
impact of the slumping U.S. housing sector, which since August
has roiled global stock markets, sank some hedge funds and caused
the leaders of major U.S. banks to be sacked.
</P>
<P>
Exports rose 2.9 percent, up for the 10th straight quarter and
much faster than a revised 0.9 percent gain in the April-June
quarter as Asian nations bought more Japanese goods, such as cars
and motorcycles.
</P>
<P>
Imports were up 0.5 percent, after gaining 0.8 percent in the
second quarter, due in part to higher oil and natural resource
prices.
