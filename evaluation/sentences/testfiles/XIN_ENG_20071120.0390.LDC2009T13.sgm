WASHINGTON, Nov. 20 (Xinhua)
</P>
<P>
The top U.S. general stressed Tuesday the need to keep the
military option against Iran on table while adding that diplomacy
is "really important."
</P>
<P>
"I'd never take the military option off the table," Michael
Mullen, who chairs the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, told a group
of foreign reporters in Washington.
</P>
<P>
However, "having the military option on the table doesn't mean
it's going to get used," he went on.
</P>
<P>
"But it certainly is intended to ensure that there's no
miscommunication or miscalculation; that the potential is there
and the resolve is there though it is restrained at this point,"
Mullen added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he said, "I think that diplomacy is really important
... I think the diplomatic engagement is really important. I am
hopeful that talks will resume with them."
</P>
<P>
Mullen also expressed concerns over Iran's actions.
</P>
<P>
"Their actions and rhetoric have been destabilizing, not only in
Iraq, but in the region. And I think we'd all like to see Iran
take a constructive and responsible role," he said.
</P>
<P>
Since Mullen became chairman on Oct. 1, he has expressed concern
about Iran for several times.
</P>
<P>
He said last month that while military action against Iran is a
last resort, the U.S. military has the resources to attack if
needed despite the strains of wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
