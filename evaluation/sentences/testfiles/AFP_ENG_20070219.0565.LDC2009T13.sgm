Beijing manners improve but not yet tops

A campaign to improve the manners of Beijing's queue-jumping
residents ahead of the Olympics is showing results although a
gold-medal standard is still a long way off, state press reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Incidents of littering, spitting, flaunting traffic rules and
pushing ahead in queues have all started to decline since 2005,
the Xinhua news agency said, citing an extensive study by the the
People's University of China.
</P>
<P>
A "civic index" -- measuring compliance with health and social
rules, attitudes towards strangers, etiquette in watching sports
events and willingness to contribute to the Olympics -- is
improving, the study said.
</P>
<P>
The index stood at 69.06 last year, up 3.85 points from 2005 but
still well done on the goal set of 72-78 for August 2008, when
the world will focus on Beijing for the Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
"The government and citizens still have a lot of things to do to
improve their public behaviour," Xinhua quoted Sha Lianxiang, a
sociology professor with the university and an author of the
study, as saying.
</P>
<P>
As part of government efforts to improve manners, 4.3 million
households have received pamphlets outlining social misdemeanours
such as spitting and littering.
</P>
<P>
The government has also this month held the first of its
designated anti-queue jumping days. On the 11th day of each
month, residents will now be expected to pay special attention to
not pushing in line.
</P>
<P>
"Line up politely -- welcome the Olympics in an orderly and
civilised manner," read a banner adorning a bus stop on February
11, the first official day of the programme.
</P>
<P>
Last year the city government also launched a "smile" campaign.
