UN accuses US-led troops in deaths of Afghans

KABUL, Afghanistan 2008-08-26 19:35:15 UTC
</P>
<P>
In a stark warning to U.S. forces, the Afghan government said it
will try to regulate the presence of U.S. troops and their use of
airstrikes, while the U.N. on Tuesday announced that "convincing
evidence" exists that an American-led operation killed 90
civilians.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. sent in a team of investigators, who relied solely on
villagers' statements in alleging the American-led operation in
the western province of Herat on Friday killed 60 children and 30
adults. The U.S. military stood by its account, that 25 militants
and five civilians were killed in the operation.
</P>
<P>
"I don't have any information that would suggest that our
military commanders in Afghanistan don't believe, still, that
this was a legitimate strike on a Taliban target," Defense
Department spokesman Bryan Whitman said in Washington.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. allegation comes a day after President Hamid Karzai's
government said it will try to put more controls on the way
American and NATO troops operate in response to a series of
airstrikes and other operations this summer that have caused the
deaths of scores of civilians.
</P>
<P>
Afghanistan's Council of Ministers ordered the ministries of
defense and foreign affairs to open negotiations with the U.S.
and NATO over the use of airstrikes, house searches and the
detentions of Afghan civilians. It also called for a "status of
force" agreement to regulate the troops' presence.
</P>
<P>
Afghanistan's effort to rein in foreign forces is similar to
steps taken by the Iraqi government, which has demanded a
timetable for the withdrawal of U.S. troops and greater control
of U.S. operations until their departure.
</P>
<P>
The U.N.'s allegation of such a large number of civilian deaths
could set the U.S., U.N. and the Afghan government on a collision
course over the use of military force in Afghan villages, where
international troops battle Taliban and al-Qaida militants daily.
</P>
<P>
Vitaly Churkin, the Russian ambassador to the United Nations,
said the Russians were raising the issue of the civilian
casualties in Afghanistan with the U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
Afghan officials also say that scores of civilians -- between 76
and 90 -- were killed in Herat province on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Civilian casualties have long been a major source of friction
between President Hamid Karzai and his Western backers. Afghan
officials say civilian deaths create a rift between the
government and the people that Taliban and other anti-government
forces use as leverage to turn villagers away from the
government.
</P>
<P>
According to an Associated Press tally, 705 civilians have been
killed this year: 536 by militants, and 158 by international
forces; 11 civilians have died in cross fire. The numbers do not
include figures from the Herat battle and likely do not account
for all civilian deaths this year.
</P>
<P>
U.S. and NATO officials say they take great care in their
targeting but also accuse the militants of hiding in civilian
homes and using Afghans as human shields.
</P>
<P>
Another factor, diplomats in Kabul say, is that Karzai is running
for re-election next year. Blaming foreigners for the ills
afflicting the country is a sure way to win popular support.
</P>
<P>
Anti-foreigner sentiment has been rising over the years here,
partly because of civilian deaths but also because many Afghans
do not see the benefits of billions of dollars in aid that have
poured into the country since the ouster of the Taliban in late
2001.
</P>
<P>
Karzai's spokesman, Humayun Hamidzada, said Tuesday that the
ministers' decision was made after Afghan officials "lost
patience" with foreign forces, and the killings and detentions of
civilians during raids in remote villages.
</P>
<P>
"We do not want international forces to leave Afghanistan until
the time our security institutions are able to defend Afghanistan
independently," Hamidzada told reporters.
</P>
<P>
But the presence of those forces has to be based "within the
framework of Afghan law with respect to international law," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Hamidzada said circumstances have changed. "Afghanistan of 2001
is different from Afghanistan today," he said. He said the
government has not discussed any timetable for the withdrawal of
international forces from Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Air Force Lt. Col. Patrick Ryder, a Pentagon spokesman, said the
legal framework for the presence of U.S. troops in Afghanistan
was established in a 2003 agreement between Kabul and Washington.
Done via an exchange of diplomatic notes, the pact is considered
a bilateral agreement and is like a status of forces agreement,
Ryder said.
</P>
<P>
In a statement Tuesday, the U.N. put its weight behind the Afghan
government claim of civilian deaths in Herat, saying its
investigators "found convincing evidence, based on the testimony
of eyewitnesses, and others, that some 90 civilians were killed,
including 60 children, 15 women and 15 men."
</P>
<P>
The U.N. did not provide photos or evidence that its
investigators who went to the scene saw any graves or that any
militants were among those killed. Instead it relied on
statements of villagers, local officials and eyewitnesses.
</P>
<P>
Dan McNorton, a spokesman for the U.N. in Kabul, said the world
body's investigation is ongoing.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. said that "residents were able to confirm the number of
casualties, including names, age and gender of the victims."
</P>
<P>
"The destruction from aerial bombardment was clearly evident with
some 7-8 houses having been totally destroyed and serious damage
to many others," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The top U.S. coalition commander has ordered an investigation.
</P>
<P>
"We welcome getting all the facts on the table," said Corina
Sanders, a U.S. Embassy spokeswoman. "We take civilian casualties
very seriously."
