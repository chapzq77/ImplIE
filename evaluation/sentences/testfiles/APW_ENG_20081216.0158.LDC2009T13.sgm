Canada's Research in Motion and South Korea's SK Telecom
announced Tuesday the launch of corporate service for the
Blackberry Bold smartphone, which will be available in South
Korea via a local network for the first time.
</P>
<P>
The two companies said in a press release that the device was
expected to be available on the market by the end of the month.
Plans were to target both foreign and domestic companies, it
said.
</P>
<P>
Use of the Blackberry and other foreign smart phones has been
hampered by a South Korean rule that required all mobile devices
to carry special software adapted to South Korea's wireless
Internet platform. An exception to that requirement was made
earlier this year, paving the way for the Blackberry Bold's
arrival, though so far only corporate customers will be allowed
to sign up for service.
</P>
<P>
The Korean Communications Commission announced last week that the
rule will be abolished from April 1, which could entice foreign
smart phone makers -- which have shied away because of the extra
cost involved in modifying their phones -- to enter South Korea
and potentially target retail customers.
</P>
<P>
The release did not mention whether Waterloo, Ontario-based
Research in Motion Ltd. and SK telecom Co., headquartered in
Seoul, planned to market the Blackberry to individuals after
April 1.
</P>
<P>
The South Korean mobile device market is dominated by Samsung
Electronics Co. and LG Electronics Inc.
</P>
<P>
Currently, it is not impossible to use a Blackberry in South
Korea. Some foreign businesses that operate in the country have
set up accounts with providers in Hong Kong and had their
employees use them in South Korea by using the roaming function.
</P>
<P>
Blackberry has partnered with another South Korean company in
offering a wireless device used mostly for communciation in the
trucking industry.
