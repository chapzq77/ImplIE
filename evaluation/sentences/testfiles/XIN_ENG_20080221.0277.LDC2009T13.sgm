Roundup: Bush promises support for Liberia's post-civil war
recovery

NAIROBI, Feb. 21 (Xinhua)
</P>
<P>
U.S. President George W. Bush promised U.S. support for Liberia's
recovery from a crippling civil war as he visited Thursday the
staunchest ally of America in Africa, on the fifth and final stop
of his trip to the continent.
</P>
<P>
"We want to help you recover from a horrible period and live
lives of hope and peace," Bush told Liberian President Ellen
Johnson-Sirleaf in Monrovia, the war- damaged coastal capital of
the small West African state, according to reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
It was the first visit in 30 years by a U.S. president to
Liberia, which, being Africa's first republic founded by freed
slaves from America in 1847, has close ties with the United
States.
</P>
<P>
Praising her "courage and leadership," Bush presented Johnson-
Sirleaf, Africa's first elected woman head of state, with the
National Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian award that a U.S.
president can bestow.
</P>
<P>
Bush vowed sustained U.S. help to battle poverty and disease as
well as an education initiative -- 1 million textbooks and desks
and seating for 10,000 students by the beginning of the next
school year.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. First Lady Laura Bush pledged to about a dozen Liberian
school children she met at the foreign affairs ministry offices
that "We American people are going to do everything we can to
help Liberians overcome the challenges they are facing."
</P>
<P>
Bush was in Liberia at the end of a trip that has taken him to
Benin, Tanzania, Rwanda and Ghana, bearing more than 1 billion
dollars in aid as he tried to highlight U.S. backed "success
stories" and urged an end to regional conflicts.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. president noted that the United States, partnering with
the United Nations, has been working to train a new Liberian
armed forces after the latest gruesome fighting claimed some 200,
000 lives.
</P>
<P>
"We are working to heal the wounds of war, and strengthen
democracy, and build a new armed forces that will be a source of
security for the Liberian people, instead of a source of terror,"
he was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
He visited a U.S. funded military training facility where U.S.
defense contractors have been training the new Liberian army
following the end of a devastating 1989-2003 civil war.
</P>
<P>
Since 2003, Washington has spent 139 million U.S. dollars to help
modernize Liberia's armed forces.
</P>
<P>
Different from other African countries, who have spurned U.S.
overtures for a greater military presence on the continent,
Liberia has said it is willing to host a new continental U.S.
military command, known as AFRICOM. However, Bush and his host
did not publicly discuss Liberia's offer to host the AFRICOM.
</P>
<P>
Some African critics have tied AFRICOM to the fact that by 2015
Washington expects that 25 percent of the oil it imports will
come from the continent, basically from the Gulf of Guinea.
</P>
<P>
In Ghana, however, Bush denied any plans for new bases and said
AFRICOM "is aiming to help provide military assistance to African
nations, so African nations are more capable of dealing with
Africa's conflicts, like peacekeeping training."
</P>
<P>
Under a nine-year U.S. African Education Initiative, Liberia is
receiving 600 million dollars until 2010.
</P>
<P>
The trip, which started last Saturday, is Bush's second visit to
the continent since he became president more than seven years
ago. It is also probably the last one before his term ends in
January next year.
</P>
<P>
The White House said Bush's main focus was on the development
agenda. But analysts believe the ultimate goal of the visit is to
promote U.S. long-term strategic interests in Africa.
