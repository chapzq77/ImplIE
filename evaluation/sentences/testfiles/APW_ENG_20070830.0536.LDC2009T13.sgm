<P>
An al-Qaida front group claimed Thursday on an Islamic Web site
known to be used by extremists that it had executed an employee
of the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
The veracity of the claim could not be independently verified and
the U.S. Embassy said it was looking into the report but had no
immediate comment.
</P>
<P>
On the site, the Islamic State of Iraq claimed the execution of
an embassy "official" it identified as Zaher Abdel Mohsin Abdel-
Saheb took place Saturday as revenge for "the Muslim women who
are still captives in the prisons of Shiites and crusaders."
</P>
<P>
The Arabic-language statement was signed by the Ministry of
Information of the Islamic State of Iraq.
