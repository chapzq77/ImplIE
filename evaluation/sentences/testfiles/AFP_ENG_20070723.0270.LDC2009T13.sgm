Ignacio Polanco on Monday won unanimous boardroom backing to
succeed his late father as chairman of Spanish publishing group
Prisa, the group said.
</P>
<P>
"The board of Prisa group today unanimously approved Ignacio
Polanco as chairman," a statement said.
</P>
<P>
Ignacio Polanco, 52, succeeds Jesus de Polanco, who died Saturday
aged 77 after a battle with cancer.
</P>
<P>
Jesus de Polanco transformed a schoolbook publisher he founded in
1958 into Prisa, the largest media company in the Spanish-
speaking world, in the process becoming one of Spain's richest
men.
</P>
<P>
He was involved in setting up top-selling daily centre-left
newspaper El Pais in 1976, a move helping to restore Spain's
independent press following the 1975 death of dictator General
Francisco Franco.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero said at the weekend
that Polanco had played an important and courageous role in
helping Spain return to democracy.
</P>
<P>
Polanco used El Pais as a springboard to develop Prisa, which now
employs 14,000 people in 22 countries.
</P>
<P>
The media group includes Cadena Ser radio, which like El Pais is
close to Spain's Socialist government, as well as business paper
Cinco Dias and television channel Cuatro.
</P>
<P>
Prisa, in which the Polanco family has a 64 percent stake, also
owns several radio stations in Latin America.
</P>
<P>
The company has a stake in French daily Le Monde, as well as in
Spanish pay- television firm Sogecable. It also controls
Portugal's media firm Media Capital.
</P>
<P>
Polanco himself ranked 11th on a list of Spain's richest people
drawn up by daily El Mundo at the end of 2006 with an estimated
net worth of 2.3 billion euros (3.2 billion US dollars), enough
to earn him 287th place on Forbes'  world billionaires' list.
</P>
<P>
Prisa, which was listed on the stock market seven years ago,
posted a net profit of 228.9 million euros in 2006, a 49.8
percent increase over the previous year, on revenues of 2.8
billion euros.
