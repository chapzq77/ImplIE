Ukraine ' s president discusses possible dissolution of
parliament with faction leaders

KIEV, Ukraine 2007-04-02 12:08:04 UTC

<P>
Ukraine's President Viktor Yushchenko convened parliamentary
faction leaders on Monday to present a stark choice: stop trying
to expand the majority coalition by poaching pro-presidential
lawmakers or face the dissolution of parliament.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was seen as an effort to find a way out of the
escalating political crisis, but it also could lay the groundwork
for Yushchenko to sign the dissolution order. Under Ukraine's
constitution, Yushchenko must first meet with the parliamentary
speaker and faction leaders before signing the order to disband
the legislature.
</P>
<P>
Yushchenko has accused Premier Viktor Yanukovych of trying to
usurp power by unconstitutionally expanding his majority in
parliament and has warned the premier that he must back down.
Yanukovych has said he seeks compromise, but will not bow to any
ultimatums.
</P>
<P>
The stakes are high for the nation of 47 million and for
Yushchenko, who is under enormous pressure from all sides.
</P>
<P>
Yushchenko's former Orange Revolution allies held a major rally
in the capital Saturday, urging him to dissolve parliament.
Opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko warned that protesters could
stage a replay of Orange Revolution protests and "we won't
disperse until the president signs the order" to disband the
legislature.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Yanukovych's backers began laying the ground work for
a competing tent camp near the parliament building to pressure
the president not to dissolve the 450-seat house.
</P>
<P>
"It's extremely dangerous today to escalate the conflict ... to
increase emotional pressure on voters and politicians," said
Raysa Bohatyrova, leader of Yanukovych's party faction in
parliament. She said that if Yushchenko signs an order to disband
parliament, lawmakers were ready to immediately appeal to the
Constitutional Court to rule on its legality.
</P>
<P>
The standoff between Yushchenko and Yanukovych arose after 11
lawmakers allied with the president defected to Yanukovych's
coalition last month, in violation of the constitution, which
says the coalition can be expanded only by the addition of entire
factions, not individual lawmakers. Yushchenko also wants a new
law that compels local lawmakers to remain with the party they
belonged to during the election to also be applied to
parliamentary lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
Yanukovych now has the support of 260 lawmakers in the 450-seat
house, and his party has suggested they will soon reach 300 --
enough to overturn presidential vetoes and make changes to the
constitution.
</P>
<P>
Yushchenko came to power after hundreds of thousands of
Ukrainians flooded onto Independence Square to protest
Yanukovych's fraud-marred presidential victory in 2004. The
Supreme Court overturned Yanukovych's victory and called new
elections, which Yushchenko won.
</P>
<P>
Yanukovych rebounded in last year's parliamentary elections,
capitalizing on widespread disappointment in the slow pace of
reforms and divisions between the Orange Revolution team.
</P>
<P>
Yanukovych's party put together a majority coalition, and
Yanukovych returned as premier. The two rivals started feuding
almost immediately, and Yanukovych has increasingly moved to
sideline the president.
