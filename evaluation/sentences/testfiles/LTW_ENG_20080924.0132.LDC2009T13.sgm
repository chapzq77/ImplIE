Lawsuit Says Auto Club Imposes Battery Sales Quotas (Los Angeles)

LOS ANGELES
</P>
<P>
Members of the Automobile Club of Southern California who call
for roadside help when they have a dead battery often are sold
new batteries when only a jump start is needed, a lawsuit filed
Tuesday alleges.
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit, filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court, alleges
that the Auto Club imposes a quota system regarding battery sales
on the tow truck operators who answer roadside assistance calls
placed by club members.
</P>
<P>
Auto Club tow-truck drivers who fail to meet their quota risk
losing "valuable future customers," the suit contends, and
operators who exceed their quotas are paid unspecified
incentives.
</P>
<P>
The suit, which seeks class-action status, was filed on behalf of
L.A.-area resident Paul Martin Davis-Miller. According to the
suit, Miller called the Auto Club earlier this year when his car
wouldn't start. The tow truck operator who answered the call sold
him a new battery that cost him about $125.
</P>
<P>
"However, subsequent tests of the purportedly `dead' battery have
established that the replaced battery was fully functional and
able to hold a full charge," according to the suit.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Auto Club, which has more than 6 million
members, said he hadn't seen the suit and couldn't comment on the
allegations.
</P>
<P>
In 2001, the Auto Club launched a new program in which tow truck
operators could replace batteries at the scene of a breakdown
rather than simply tow the vehicle to a repair facility. The
service has been popular with members, said David Lang, the Auto
Club's vice president of automotive services.
</P>
<P>
The Auto Club gets about 4 million calls a year for roadside
assistance, including dead batteries, lockouts and motorists who
run out of gas.
</P>
<P>
San Francisco attorney William Audet, who filed the lawsuit, said
the number of victims could run into the thousands. The suit
seeks repayment of money allegedly paid for fraudulently replaced
batteries as well as unspecified punitive damages.
