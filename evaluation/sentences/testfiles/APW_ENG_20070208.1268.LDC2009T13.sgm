Former Austrian ski coach Walter Mayer dropped charges against
the International Olympic Committee and the World Anti-Doping
Agency on Thursday, his lawyer Christian Pilz said.
</P>
<P>
Mayer had sued WADA chairman Richard Pound and IOC president
Jacques Rogge following his ban from the 2006 Turin Olympics
after allegations of blood doping at the 2002 Salt Lake City
Games.
</P>
<P>
Mayer still traveled to Turin last year, but he fled Italy after
police raided the living quarters of the Austrian biathlon and
cross-country teams in search of banned substances and equipment.
He ended up in a psychiatric hospital after ramming a blockade.
</P>
<P>
"Mayer regrets that his presence at the Olympics caused such big
irritations, and now he has understanding for the following
statements by Pound and Rogge about him," Pilz said.
</P>
<P>
Pound was quoted in the Austrian newspaper Die Presse in February
as saying that a search of Mayer's house in the Austrian province
of Styria in January divulged "equipment and instruments suitable
for blood doping," Mayer's lawyer, Herwig Hasslacher, said in
August.
</P>
<P>
The hearing in the suit against Pound was scheduled for Tuesday,
while the one against Rogge had been set for March 6.
