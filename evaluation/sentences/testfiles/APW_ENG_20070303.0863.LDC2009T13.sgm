The al-Qaida affiliated Islamic State of Iraq posted on Saturday
a video of the execution of 18 Iraqi security troops, shot in the
back of their heads while kneeling on the ground in a field.

<P>
The 3 minute video, posted on a web site known to be used by the
Islamists, said the 18 kidnapped government security forces were
slain in retaliation for the alleged rape of a Sunni woman by
members of the Shiite-dominated police. The video's authenticity
could not be immediately verified.
