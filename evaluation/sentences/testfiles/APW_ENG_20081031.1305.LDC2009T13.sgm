GUANTANAMO BAY NAVAL BASE, Cuba 2008-10-31 21:29:46 UTC

A jury at Guantanamo's second war-crimes trial began deliberating
Friday whether al-Qaida's alleged "media secretary" is guilty of
war crimes that could put him in prison for life.
</P>
<P>
The nine jurors, all Pentagon-approved U.S. military officers,
were reviewing the prosecutors' evidence. The accused offered no
defense after calling the proceedings a "legal farce."
</P>
<P>
The prosecution said Ali Hamza al-Balhul's violent propaganda
videos helped inspire the Sept. 11 attacks. The Yemeni prisoner
also helped prepare at least two Sept. 11 hijackers for their
mission and instructed many other terrorists through videos he
created as a propagandist for al-Qaida in Afghanistan, Army Maj.
Daniel Cowhig said.
</P>
<P>
"The accused shouted through the medium of video, the Internet,
and DVDs: Love death, hate life," Cowhig told the jury of U.S.
military officers at the isolated Navy base.
</P>
<P>
Al-Bahul refused to present a defense in the weeklong trial, and
his Pentagon-appointed lawyer did not speak at all in deference
to his client's wishes, declining to answer questions from the
judge.
</P>
<P>
A Yemeni who was brought to Guantanamo in 2002, al-Bahul is the
second prisoner to go through a war crimes trial under the
special military commissions system. He faces up to life in
prison if convicted of conspiracy, supporting terrorism and
solicitation to commit murder.
</P>
<P>
The military claims al-Bahlul committed war crimes by serving as
chief propagandist for al-Qaida and as an aide to its leader,
Osama bin Laden. Videos made by the defendant were allegedly
shown to terrorist recruits at training camps in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Cowhig said he also arranged for lead Sept. 11 hijacker Mohamed
Atta to swear a loyalty oath to bin Laden, and prepared martyrdom
wills for Atta and fellow hijacker Ziad Jarrah in preparation for
the attacks against the United States.
</P>
<P>
"(These videos) contain the thoughts, the beliefs, the ideals of
the accused," the prosecutor said.
</P>
<P>
The military says al-Bahlul repeatedly admitted to interrogators
that he was al-Qaida's media chief and made propaganda videos for
bin Laden. Al-Bahlul doesn't consider his actions criminal. But
the U.S. military already determined him to be an unlawful enemy
combatant, and says any work he did for al-Qaida is by definition
a war crime because al-Qaida is a terrorist organization.
</P>
<P>
At one point, al-Bahlul smiled broadly as the uniformed
prosecutor directly addressed the defendant.
</P>
<P>
"The accused identifies himself as an officer of al-Qaida,"
Cowhig said, looking at the slight man with a close-cropped
beard. "Al-Qaida is not an army, and you are not an officer."
</P>
<P>
The judge, Air Force Col. Ronald Gregory, quickly ordered Cowhig
to stop addressing the defendant and instead turn his attention
to the jurors.
</P>
<P>
Jamil Dakwar, an American Civil Liberties Union lawyer who has
been observing the trial, said the prosecution failed to prove
al-Bahlul has any real connection to the Sept. 11 attacks.
</P>
<P>
"It is an injustice to the victims of 9-11 for the government to
build its case solely by videos and images of the attacks,"
Dakwar said. "Americans deserve better than this."
