Football: Kahn should have been punished more, says Netzer
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Bayern Munich captain Oliver Kahn was lucky to escape with a
25,000-euros (37,500-US dollars) fine and one-match suspension
for his behaviour last weekend, according to former German
international Guenter Netzer. Kahn was reprimanded on Tuesday for
comments made over the weekend when he criticised Bayern's stars
Franck Ribery and Luca Toni for inconsistent performances and
then made an early exit from the club's Christmas party on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
But coach Ottmar Hitzfeld's sanctions have generated plenty of
debate in Germany with former midfielder and TV pundit Netzer
insisting Bayern should have taken a tougher line on the former
German national captain.
</P>
<P>
"I would have punished him more and taken the captaincy off him,
because his actions show his ignorance towards his role in the
team," said Netzer, who won 37 caps and helped West Germany win
the 1972 European Championships.
</P>
<P>
Kahn has kept the captaincy, but is suspended for Saturday's
Bundesliga clash with Hertha Berlin and should be back in goal
for next Wednesday's UEFA Cup clash against Aris Thessaloniki.
</P>
<P>
Hitzfeld will issue his team with a code of conduct over the
Bundesliga's winter break so his players know what is expected of
them and what he considers to be appropriate behaviour in a bid
to avoid any repetition of Kahn's comments.
</P>
<P>
"I had no other choice," said Hitzfeld when asked about his
sanctions on Kahn. "It's not always easy being a coach. I respect
Ollie as a person and a personality, he is loyal to me, as I am
to him, but you have to separate that sometimes and somethings
you just can't accept.
</P>
<P>
"I want to give out the code of conduct, so the players to be
clear on what they can and can't do, so there is no
misunderstanding."
</P>
<P>
Hitzfeld's contract expires at the end of the season and he has
hinted at an interest in taking over as coach of the Swiss
national team after next summer's Euro 2008 tournament.
</P>
<P>
Former Bayern midfielder and Germany international Stefan
Effenberg says current VfB Stuttgart coach Armin Veh would be a
good replacement.
</P>
<P>
"Armin Veh would be a good replacement, he has Champions League
experience," said Effenberg. "No one knows if Hitzfeld will stay
in Munich for next season, but Veh would do a good job here if
the job became vacant."
