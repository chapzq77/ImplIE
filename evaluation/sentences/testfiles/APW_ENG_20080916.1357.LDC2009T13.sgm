Goldman posts worst quarter since going public

NEW YORK 2008-09-16 21:13:48 UTC
</P>
<P>
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., the larger of the two remaining major
independent U.S. investment banks, on Tuesday reported its worst
slump in profits since going public in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The world's largest investment bank reported third-quarter profit
plunged 71 percent from the year-ago period, an almost
unthinkable drop for a firm widely described as the smartest on
Wall Street. Goldman's results reflect continuing damage from the
ongoing credit crisis that has already vanquished three of its
rivals.
</P>
<P>
Goldman and Morgan Stanley remain the only major independent
investment banks on Wall Street after a major shake-up of the
investment banking industry. Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. filed
for bankruptcy Monday after succumbing to distressed real estate
holdings, while Bear Stearns Cos. and Merrill Lynch &amp; Co.
were swallowed by commercial banks in emergency sales.
</P>
<P>
After two years of record profits, Chairman and Chief Executive
Lloyd Blankfein has been the only CEO to navigate his firm
through the market dislocation without posting a loss or major
write-downs. He said "this was a challenging quarter" marred by a
"decrease in client activity and declining asset valuations."
</P>
<P>
That was reflected in the numbers. The New York-based investment
bank posted a profit of $810 million, or $1.81 per share, after
paying preferred dividends compared to $2.81 billion, or $6.13
per share, a year earlier. Revenue for the three months ended
Aug. 29 skidded 51 percent to $6.04 billion from $12.3 billion a
year ago.
</P>
<P>
The results still beat Wall Street projections for $1.71 per
share, according to analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. Revenue
fell short of the $6.23 billion expected by analysts.
</P>
<P>
The financial market turmoil is certainly one of the low points
in Goldman's 139-year history. Though it has avoided the kind of
bruising results turned in by many of its rivals, Goldman's
shares are still down almost 50 percent from its 52-week high of
$250.70.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the stock slid $2.49, or 1.8 percent, to $133.01
after sinking to a new 52-week low of $116.13 earlier in the
session.
</P>
<P>
Goldman's performance from some of its renowned businesses
reflected the market's dislocation since the credit crisis began
one year ago. Investment banking revenue tumbled 40 percent, and
trading and investments notched 67 percent lower.
</P>
<P>
The fall of Bear Stearns last March when it was sold to JPMorgan
Chase &amp; Co. helped Goldman's results during the third
quarter. Goldman's prime brokerage, which trades securities for
major institutional clients, reported a 20 percent surge in
revenue. That helped lift Goldman's asset management and
securities services unit's revenue higher by 4 percent from the
year-ago period.
</P>
<P>
With Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. agreeing to be acquired by Bank of
America Corp., more pressure has come on Goldman to make a
similar deal. Many analysts believe stand-alone investment banks
can balance volatile businesses like investment banking or
trading with the relative stability of deposits held by retail
banks.
</P>
<P>
Chief Financial Officer David Viniar rejected that Goldman needs
to combine with another bank to survive. He said there remains
opportunity in the market, especially buying up distressed debt
that has driven its rivals out of business.
</P>
<P>
He said the company is reducing risky positions, and expects
Goldman's profit growth will rise or fall in tandem with the
global economy. Further, it will also benefit from a financial
landscape missing some longtime competitors.
</P>
<P>
"We're not happy about what happened," Viniar said during a
conference call with reporters. "We feel for the people in these
institutions. They were very good firms that made the same
mistakes we did. They made bigger ones and got caught up in a
terrible market."
</P>
<P>
However, he added that "while we have a lot of compassion, when
there's less competition it is better for us. That sends more
business our way, gives us pricing power, and we're seeing a
little of that now."
