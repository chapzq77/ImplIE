Tiger Woods was half-joking a few months ago when he suggested
that Steve Stricker would be his pick as U.S. PGA Tour comeback
player of the year, even though Stricker won the award last year.
</P>
<P>
It could happen.
</P>
<P>
The tour award ballots went in the mail last week to players, and
Stricker is one of three candidates as comeback player of the
year. The other two are Rocco Mediate, who finished 82nd on the
money list after starting the season with a minor medical
exemption; and Brian Bateman, who earned the final card out of
Q-school and won the Buick Open.
</P>
<P>
Stricker won the award last year by starting 2006 with limited
status and finishing 34th on the money list. He followed that by
winning The Barclays for his first victory in more than six
years, finishing second to Woods in the FedEx Cup, and moving to
No. 4 in the world when his season ended.
</P>
<P>
Woods and Phil Mickelson were the two choices for U.S. PGA Tour
player of the year, while the candidates for rookie of the year
were Greensboro winner Brandt Snedeker, Las Vegas winner George
McNeill, and Anthony Kim, who was 60th on the money list.
</P>
<P>
Players have 30 days to cast their votes, and the winners are
expected to be announced on Dec. 11.

TOUR CUTS: One U.S. PGA Tour policy board decision came two weeks
too late for players who languished through a long weekend at
Disney, where 89 players made the cut.
</P>
<P>
The board approved a change in 36-hole cuts to avoid such a large
field on the weekend. Starting next year, the cut after two
rounds will remain the top 70 professionals and ties. But if more
than 78 players make the cut, only the closest number to 70 will
make it to the weekend, and the others would be paid official,
last-place money.
</P>
<P>
The board first discussed this policy in change in May, and two
names that came up during the discussion were Brad Faxon and Jose
Maria Olazabal. Both have made the cut on the number and went on
to win the tournament -- Faxon in 2005 at Hartford, Connecticut,
and Olazabal in 2002 at Torrey Pines.
</P>
<P>
At Hartford, 77 players made the cut so Faxon would have kept
playing on his way to a 65-61 weekend. In Olazabal's case,
however, 89 players made the cut. He would have gone home with
last-place money instead of shooting 67-65.

DIVOTS: Fred Couples was entitled to a major medical exemption
for 2008, but instead elected to take his one-time exemption for
being in the top 25 in U.S. tour career money. Couples is at No.
20, and might not be in the top 25 much longer. ... The Golf
Coaches Association of America has selected Arnold Palmer for its
Lifetime Achievement Award. Palmer will be only the third non-
coach inducted into the GCAA Hall of Fame, joining Karsten
Solheim and Byron Nelson. ... The 2011 U.S. Senior Open will be
held at Inverness Club in Toledo, Ohio.
