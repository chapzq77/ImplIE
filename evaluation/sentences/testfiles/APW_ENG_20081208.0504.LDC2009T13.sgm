More rioting breaks out in Greek cities

THESSALONIKI, Greece 2008-12-08 12:58:49 UTC

<P>
Riot police fired tear gas at youths smashing storefronts and
throwing rocks at a police station in this Greek port city on
Monday, one of scattered confrontations around the country on a
third day of rioting sparked by the fatal police shooting of a
teenager in Athens.
</P>
<P>
Gangs of youths overturned trash cans and set them on fire in
Thessaloniki, one of several cities where rioting began Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Running battles between riot police firing tear gas and about 400
high school students throwing rocks also broke out Monday morning
in Veria, a town about 40 miles (60 kilometers) west of
Thessaloniki.
</P>
<P>
Violence was reported in the central city of Trikala, where one
police officer was reportedly injured, while authorities braced
for more possible riots during demonstrations planned across the
country, including in Athens, in the central city of Larissa and
on the island of Corfu.
</P>
<P>
In the capital, high school students blocked streets across the
city to protest the 15-year-old's death, while dozens of youths
were still barricaded at two university campuses in Athens. Under
Greek law, the police are barred from entering university
campuses.
</P>
<P>
Rioting, much of it by self-styled anarchists, broke out across
the country within hours of the fatal shooting of 15-year-old
Alexandros Grigoropoulos on Saturday night in the often volatile
central Athens district of Exarchia.
</P>
<P>
The circumstances surrounding the death are still unclear. Two
policemen claimed they had come under attack by a group of about
30 youths, and that three warning shots and a stun grenade were
fired when they sought out the group a few minutes later.
</P>
<P>
But witnesses have disputed the officers' accounts, telling Greek
media that the policeman intended to shoot the youths. The two
policemen have been arrested and charged, one with murder and the
other as an accomplice.
</P>
<P>
About 30 civilians were reported injured on Sunday. Authorities
have said 37 policemen were hurt in Athens over the weekend by
objects thrown at them by protesters.
</P>
<P>
"Under the circumstances, I think we achieved the best possible
result. Human life was protected, both that of the demonstrators
and the police, that's the most important thing," police
spokesman Panayiotis Stathis said.
</P>
<P>
In Berlin, 15 Greek youths occupied their country's consulate to
protest the Athens shooting, the mission said without
elaborating. Berlin police say there have been no violence or
disturbances.
</P>
<P>
The last time a teenager was killed in a police shooting --
during a demonstration in 1985 -- it triggered weeks of rioting.
</P>
<P>
Schools across Athens and the neighboring port city of Piraeus
will remain closed in mourning for the dead teenager
</P>
<P>
The Police Officers' Association has apologized to the boy's
family, and President Karolos Papoulias sent a telegram to his
parents expressing his condolences.
</P>
<P>
"This death was a blow to the country," Papoulias said. "I am
certain that those responsible will be held to account."
</P>
<P>
Violence often breaks out between riot police and anarchists
during demonstrations in Greece. Anarchist groups are also blamed
for late-night firebombings of targets such as banks and
diplomatic vehicles. The attacks rarely cause injuries.
</P>
<P>
The self-styled anarchist movement partly traces its roots in the
resistance to Greece's 1967-74 military dictatorship. The youths
tend to espouse general anti-capitalist and anti-Establishment
principles, and have long-running animosity toward the police.
</P>
<P>
The country has experienced frequent and sometimes violent
demonstrations recently against the increasingly unpopular
conservative government of Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis,
which has been rocked by a land swap scandal and has struggled to
push through economic reforms. The opposition Socialists are now
consistently ahead in opinion polls for the first time in eight
years.
