Euro sets fresh record against yen
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The euro struck a fresh record high against the yen Monday as
expectations faded of a quick increase in Japan's ultra-low
interest rates, dealers said.
</P>
<P>
In late European trading, the euro reached 165.74 yen, up from
165.20 late on Friday in New York.
</P>
<P>
The European single currency also rose to 1.3402 dollars, from
1.3385 late on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Market players were wary of taking the dollar much lower amid a
dearth of significant data, dealers said, but the yen remained
firmly under pressure as popularity for the so-called carry trade
showed no sign of abating.
</P>
<P>
"Traders are still wary of getting aboard the euro/dollar bus
after plumbing 1.3265 lows last week," said Peter Wadkins at
Thomson IFR Markets.
</P>
<P>
He noted that comments from several European Central Bank
directors -- Axel Weber, Jose Manuel Gonzalez-Paramo and Nicholas
Garganas continued to warn about inflation risks and repeat that
monetary policy was accomodative -- had therefore had little
impact.
</P>
<P>
The dollar has been under pressure since the release of weaker-
than-expected US core consumer price index (CPI) data on Friday,
which caused the market to scale down its expectations for US
interest rate increases.
</P>
<P>
The inflation news was compounded by a raft of other weak US
data, including industrial production and the latest University
of Michigan consumer sentiment reading.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the yen remained the weakest performer of the day,
hitting a fresh four-and-a-half year low against the dollar of
123.68 yen, a new record low of 165.74 yen per euro, and multi-
year lows against the pound.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese currency came under renewed pressure Friday after a
dovish speech from Bank of Japan governor Toshihiko Fukui
suggested that interest rates would not rise again any time soon.
</P>
<P>
This has kept the carry trade -- where investors borrow in low-
yielding currencies, most typically the yen, to invest in higher-
yielding assets elsewhere -- alive and well.
</P>
<P>
Later Monday, traders awaited the release of a US housing market
index from the National Association of Home Builders, though
analysts noted that the absence of many major US data releases
this week might stem the dollar's fall.
</P>
<P>
"Soft housing data could do further damage to the dollar over the
short term, but with a lack of major data releases this week the
tone is likely to one of a drift lower rather than a major
decline in the currency," said Calyon analyst Mitul Kotecha.
</P>
<P>
The euro was changing hands at 1.3402 dollars, against 1.3385
dollars on Friday, 165.74 yen (165.20), 0.6762 pounds (0.6773)
and 1.6629 Swiss francs (1.6615).
</P>
<P>
The dollar stood at 123.68 yen (123.43) and 1.2410 Swiss francs
(1.2412).
</P>
<P>
The pound was being traded at 1.9820 dollars (1.9758).
</P>
<P>
On the London Bullion Market, the price of gold rose to 656.00
dollars per ounce, from 653.10 dollars late on Friday.
