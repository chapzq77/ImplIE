PURSUIT OF QAIDA FIGHTERS BEGINS BY BLOCKING ESCAPE
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAQOUBA, Iraq
</P>
<P>
In more than four years in Iraq, American forces have been
confounded by insurgents who have often slipped away only to
fight another day. The war in Iraq has been likened to the arcade
game of whack-a-mole, where as soon as you knock down one mole
another pops up.
</P>
<P>
Taking the fight to insurgents from al-Qaida did not so much
destroy them in Anbar Province as dislodge them, prompting the
fighters to build up their strength elsewhere, including Baqouba,
the capital of Diyala Province.
</P>
<P>
So the planners of this latest operation are attempting to plug
the holes that have allowed the insurgents to escape in the past.
The goal is not merely to reclaim western Baqouba from insurgent
control, but to capture or kill the estimated 300 fighters to 500
fighters who are believed to be based in that part of the city.
</P>
<P>
By the time dawn broke on Tuesday, the insurgent sanctuary in
western Baqouba had been cordoned off. Then, the American forces
established footholds on the periphery of the section and slowly
pressed in. "Rather than let the problem export to some other
place and then have to fight them again, my goal is to isolate
this thing and cordon it off," said Col. Steve Townsend, the
commander of the 3rd Stryker Brigade Combat Team, 2nd Infantry
Division.
</P>
<P>
It promises to be a methodical, steady squeeze against fighters
from al-Qaida of Mesopotamia, who have fortified their positions
and have shown no signs of giving in.
</P>
<P>
The problem of collaring the Qaida fighters is challenging in
several respects. Unlike Fallujah, where most of the population
fled in advance of the battle, thousands of civilians remain in
the western section of the city.
</P>
<P>
American helicopters dropped leaflets last night urging the
residents to stay in their homes. The hope was to keep civilians
off the streets while American forces began to close in on the
insurgents. The appeal appeared to have little effect, though, as
large groups of civilians mingled on the streets Tuesday and some
students even sought to go to the local university.
</P>
<P>
The presence of so many civilians on an urban battlefield affords
the operatives from al-Qaida another possible means to elude
their American pursuers. If the insurgents do not manage to sneak
out some may hide their arms and try to blend with the city's
residents.
</P>
<P>
To frustrate such plans, the Americans intend to take
fingerprints and other biometric data from every resident who
seems to be a potential fighter after they and Iraqi forces have
gained control of the western side of the city. The Americans
will also test for the presence of explosive material on
suspects' hands.
