Putting a Special `Shine' on the Stones
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Mick Jagger would have, that's who.
</P>
<P>
When asked by Dick Cavett  in 1972 whether "you can picture
yourself at age 60 doing what you do now," Jagger grinned and
responded, "Easily, yeah." Period, close quote, end of story.
</P>
<P>
What "Shine a Light," Martin Scorsese's concert documentary, does
beautifully is illuminate the way things are now with the self-
described world's greatest rock 'n' roll band. We see that
benefit show and a Clinton birthday concert, filmed over two
nights in 2006 at New York's Beacon Theatre, and by the time it's
over, we are thoroughly entertained. But getting to that point
turns out to have been a tougher slog than might be expected.
</P>
<P>
What makes it tough, frankly, is all those accumulated years.
It's not that the group has any difficulty performing up to its
standards, it's that youth and anarchy (not always Bill Clinton's
areas) are part of rock's DNA, and seeing the Stones as up close
and personal as a concert film demands presents us with the
unnerving spectacle of their battle-hardened, not to say
sepulchral, faces.
</P>
<P>
This is especially the case with  Jagger. Yes, he can still run
and jump with the best of them, but on camera, that movement
plays like a practiced performance untouched by genuine emotion.
Rather than feeling the music, we are wondering who does his hair
and what kind of an exercise and stretching routine he maintains.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, though,  "Sympathy for the  Devil" makes us
wonder if Jagger  really is Mr. Scratch. This is especially true
after the band's rendition of "As Tears Go By," originally
recorded by Marianne Faithfull, reminds us of how differently age
has treated these former lovers.
</P>
<P>
Paradoxically, age is hardly a problem with Keith Richards. With
his exceptional ability to lose himself in the music -- "I don't
think on stage, I feel," he says at one point -- the Stones'
guitarist looks like a wraith from another dimension, a being
beyond both space and time.
</P>
<P>
If the overall age of the group is a problem, "Shine a Light" has
the resources to combat and overcome it, key among them being the
amount of filmmaking craft and skill director Scorsese and his
team bring to the proceedings.
</P>
<P>
A meticulous planner and music aficionado who worked on
"Woodstock" and whose credits include "The Last Waltz" and two
excellent PBS music documentary series, Scorsese is also a film
preservationist who seems to relish the task of conserving the
almost retro nature of these concerts, shooting not in 3-D in
massive soccer stadiums the way U2 did but in 35 millimeter in a
relatively intimate Broadway theater.
</P>
<P>
And although "Shine a Light" is largely a concert documentary,
Scorsese has shrewdly  included a smattering of other material,
including the  Cavett chat.
</P>
<P>
There's some behind-the-scenes footage emphasizing the comic
opera aspects of preparation -- "We cannot burn Mick Jagger," the
director says sternly when a lighting issue makes immolation a
possibility -- as well as a selection of mostly inane interviews
the group has endured over the years.
</P>
<P>
The heart of "Shine a Light," though, is the marvelous
performance footage the 18 camera operators, led by director of
photography Robert Richardson and including such major talents as
Robert Elswit, John Toll, Albert Maysles, Stuart Dryburgh, Andrew
Lesnie, Emmanuel Lubezki, Declan Quinn and Ellen Kuras, have
managed to capture.
</P>
<P>
As put together in a  heroic nine-month job of editing by David
Tedeschi, this remarkable footage casually captures wonderful
moments of musicianship and style, from Buddy Guy's intense
guitar work on "Champagne and Reefer" to Ronnie Wood's hypnotic
pedal steel solo on "Far Away Eyes" as well as   Richards coolly
spitting a cigarette out of his mouth just because he wants to.
</P>
<P>
Finally, it is the scorching intensity of the blues- and
R&amp;B-inflected songs the Stones play, not any on-stage antics,
that keeps the group involved in performing and the audience
keyed into the film. With expert backup singers and veteran
musicians such as  Bobby Keys on tenor sax and Darryl Jones on
bass providing a solid grounding, the music's insistent richness
builds and builds, its sound becoming so deep and persuasive that
qualms about age fade and the rhythms carry us away.
</P>
<P>
The Stones have been in any number of memorable films, including
1970's "Gimme Shelter" and  Robert Frank's documentary with the
unprintable name, but this outing is special, because of where it
arrives and the obstacles it faced along the way. "Shine a
Light"  might not be the last Rolling Stones movie, but it's
likely to be the last one with a touch of the poet about it.
