THE ILLUSTRIOUS FOREBEARS OF MR. ED

<P>
Without horses, where would we be? Trousers might never have
become fashionable. The violin might never have come into
existence. The Aztecs might have thrived another few centuries.
The Industrial Revolution might have sputtered out before its
time. No one would have to get off his high horse, and no
political race would have a dark horse candidate. And the
American Museum of Natural History would have had to find another
subject for its sprawling, charming and illuminating exhibition
that is opening Saturday: "The Horse."
</P>
<P>
The opening festivities will include demonstrations of
horseshoeing and horse grooming; an appearance by Thumbelina, a
creature billed as the world's smallest horse (171/2 inches
tall); and a visit by a vintage horse-drawn ambulance. But the
exhibition itself relies far less on country fair spectacle and
far more on a provocative history of the ways in which humans and
horses became, as the show says, "powerfully linked." Those links
may be as slight as fashions in clothing (trousers, we are told,
developed specifically for the riding of horses) and as important
as the fate of empires ("Next to God," Cortes is supposed to have
said about the conquest of Mexico, "we owed our victory to the
horses").
</P>
<P>
The exhibition is suggestive about the evolution of the arts.
(The 13th- and 14th-century Mongols, who held their immense
empire together with the aid of the horse, also used hair from
its tail to create the ancestor of the modern violin bow.) And it
invites speculation about the course of technology. (The
Industrial Revolution ultimately displaced horse power with
horsepower, but not before horses shared the burden with
machines: on display is a horse-drawn, steam-powered firetruck
from 19th-century Pennsylvania.)
</P>
<P>
Created by Ross MacPhee, the curator of mammalogy in the Division
of Vertebrate Zoology at the museum, and Sandra Olsen, the
curator of anthropology at the Carnegie Museum of Natural History
in Pittsburgh, this show makes it clear just how crucial a role
the horse has played. With the aid of dioramas, interviews,
marvelous computer graphics, varied skeletons, archaeological
finds, reproductions of cave paintings and objects, including a
World War I gas mask for a horse and Triple Crown trophies, the
history of the horse becomes humanized. The ancient Greeks, the
show points out, might have been so surprised by their first
sight of warriors on horseback that they imagined that they were
centaurs. The exhibition almost seems to suggest that this
mythology touches on a deeper truth: The connection is so strong,
we are all of us centaurs.
</P>
<P>
At one time the relationship could hardly have been ignored.
Horses, the show reminds us, "have cleared forests, plowed land,
herded cattle and driven machines." From the moment they were
first used to pull chariots into battle (perhaps 1500 B.C.) until
their valedictory cavalry campaigns in the World War II, horses
were bound up in human warfare. Similarly, with human welfare: in
1900 130,000 horses were working in Manhattan alone (and their
presence must have been palpable: each horse, the show says,
produced up to 45 pounds of manure and 2 gallons of urine every
day).
</P>
<P>
Now we are mainly aware of horses through the remnants of horse-
inspired vocabulary, by the persistence of sports like polo, and,
as a video shows, from ceremonies from around the world that use
the horse to display power and grace. But the show reminds us
just how recent a phenomenon this diminution of importance is,
and how difficult it is to think of any human activity untouched
by the powers of the horse.
</P>
<P>
But the horse, of course, is equally unthinkable without the
human, which the exhibition also points out, but humans don't
enter the story for a while. The opening diorama shows ancient
horses of North America, some 50 million years ago: a three-toed
Hypohippus feeds on forest shrubs as a large, modern-looking
Dinohippus grazes in the grasses. A large number of horse species
were "forest browsers" with three toes. But with the changes in
climate about 35 million years ago, the predecessor of the modern
horse became dominant, his two outer toes yielding to the single
hoof, suited to the harder grasslands.
</P>
<P>
In outlining the evolution of the horse, the exhibition also
traces the animals' mass migrations, which are almost the inverse
of human pathways. Instead of beginning in Africa and migrating
to Europe, Asia and finally to the Americas, like mankind's
ancestors, horses took just the opposite path: the majority of
horse species began in the Americas. Some 20 million years ago,
three-toed horses crossed into Asia and then into Europe and
Africa. About 10,000 years ago, horses became extinct in the
Americas -- perhaps because of environmental change and
overhunting -- which is one reason they had such a forceful
impact when the Spanish took them back to the Americas, in
conquest.
</P>
<P>
That expansive family tree was pruned over time and not, it
seems, by human forces. The show argues that all contemporary
horses -- perhaps even the Asiatic wild horse, the Przewalski --
are part of a single species, Equus caballus. Even the genus
Equus is small, containing only seven living species, including
donkeys and zebras.
</P>
<P>
The impact of the horse, though, is apparent in the earliest
surviving human evidence. The show reproduces some of the
extraordinary cave paintings of Southern Europe, which are
perhaps 16,000 years old. One, in Lascaux Cave, shows a horse
looking exactly like the Przewalski wild horse of Central Asia,
with its pale stomach and dark mane.
</P>
<P>
Recent archaeological research in northern Kazakhstan, displayed
in a diorama, suggests that the Botai people of Central Asia were
among the first to domesticate horses. Digs have yielded evidence
of ancient fences, along with soil components suggesting a high
concentration of manure. In domestication, horses were remade
into human companions and human tools, but physiologically they
didn't change much-- something that, as the exhibition notes,
cannot be said of the boar when it was transformed into a
domesticated pig, or the wolf into a domesticated dog. Horses
were also "good partners": herd animals that could also show
intense loyalties. They were easily trained and relatively free
from the territorial viciousness of related species, like zebras.
</P>
<P>
Human planning split this single species into numerous branches
and more than 200 breeds. One ambition was to increase the
animal's size, so it could become a more imposing war-beast,
strong enough to bear its own 50 pounds of armor along with the
hundreds of pounds of a mounted warrior. So important was the
size of warrior horses that in the 16th century, King Henry VIII,
coveting the larger animals on the continent, decreed that all
landowners must keep at least two large mares.
</P>
<P>
Among the gentry of Europe, the domestication of the horse, and
the formal display of ownership and mastery, also came to reflect
personal cultivation and accomplishment. The French, Spanish and
English words for gentleman, the show points out -- chevalier,
caballero and cavalier -- also mean horseman.
</P>
<P>
Some parts of this show are too brief -- the transformation of
the American West could have been more imaginatively presented --
and some parts are less than revelatory: the presence of horses
in sports is familiar. The show might also have provided more
extensive glimpses of the horse in the arts: in Remington's
famous 19th-century images, in plays like "Equus," in Hollywood
westerns or even in vintage television comedies like "Mister Ed."
Horses have generally been imagined not as alien beings, but as
reflections of ourselves. They are almost never demonic; they
seem to represent the best of humanity's animal nature.
</P>
<P>
Despite weaknesses, though, the show's impact is strong. And
could interaction between humans and any other animal bear this
sort of examination? Dogs may inspire more intense and complex
friendships, but horses were almost more than companions; they
were partners in agriculture, war, industry and commerce.
</P>
<P>
The final gallery contains a remarkable life-size sculpture of a
horse, "Isbelle," by Deborah Butterfield. It seems constructed
out of scraps of driftwood, but is actually cast bronze, its
weathered skeleton looking worn and ancient. It seems old,
haphazardly shaped with its random relics and remnants, but the
creature is so tautly formed, its skeletal innards seem charged
with dynamism and power. It's not a bad image for this
presentation of the horse's history: it might seem a collection
of ancient and random facts, but when brought together as smartly
as it is, it almost comes to life, reminding us of the centaurs
we all once were.

<P>
A 'Horse' Trot
</P>
<P>
Free outdoor activities are planned Saturday from noon to 4 p.m.,
weather permitting, for the opening of "The Horse" at the
American Museum of Natural History.
</P>
<P>
On 81st Street, between Central Park West and Columbus Avenue,
members of the Equus and Equestrian Sport Foundation and others
will demonstrate how to care for horses, from hoof to mane.
Storytellers will share horse tales. Children can try on
equestrian clothing, and two equine ambulances -- one vintage and
one contemporary -- will be on view. Thumbelina, considered to be
the world's smallest horse, at a shade more than 17 inches high,
will make a personal appearance, as will members of the New York
City Parks Enforcement Patrol Mounted Auxiliary Unit. If it
rains, all will be canceled except Thumbelina's appearance, which
will move indoors.
</P>
<P>
"The Horse" will be on view through Jan. 4 and requires timed
tickets ($22; $16.50 for students and 60+; $13 for 12 and
younger). Hours: daily, 10 a.m. to 5:45 p.m.; (212) 769-5100 or
(212) 769-5200, www.amnh.org.
