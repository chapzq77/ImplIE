Europe to meet on financial rescue package
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
European leaders were to meet over the weekend in France in the
latest bid to forge a common response to the global banking
crisis, moving closer to a British-style plan of partial
nationalisation.
</P>
<P>
French President Nicolas Sarkozy and German Chancellor Angela
Merkel were to hold talks Saturday at General Charles de Gaulle's
graveside in Colombey-les- deux-Eglises and on Sunday the leaders
of all 15 eurozone members will gather in Paris.
</P>
<P>
The heads of the European Union's four biggest economies --
Britain, France, Germany and Italy -- met a week ago but Merkel
and Sarkozy were split over the need for a common plan.
</P>
<P>
However, after a week of economic turmoil and plunging stock
markets, and crisis talks on Friday between the finance ministers
of the G7 industrial powers, the single-currency bloc has agreed
to try once more to coordinate a response.
</P>
<P>
After the G7 talks in Washington, US Treasury Secretary Henry
Paulson said his government was ready to invest directly in banks
for the first time since the Great Depression in a bid to restore
confidence.
</P>
<P>
This move followed the decision by Britain's Prime Minister
Gordon Brown to guarantee inter-bank lending and to offer to take
stakes in some of the country's biggest banks in a programme of
partial nationalisation.
</P>
<P>
Europe, after reluctance in particular from Merkel's Germany, now
seems likely to follow London down this route, which bankers hope
will restart frozen lending between banks and pump vital
liquidity into financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, the German daily Die Welt reported that Germany was
working on a British-style plan, and a senior European offical
told AFP that Brown's idea was a "good one" and would be
discussed by the eurozone 15.
</P>
<P>
"It would be smart to follow the British example at the European
level," he said, speaking on condition of anonymity so as not to
pre-empt the summit.
</P>
<P>
"I spoke to Madame Merkel and I think she's open to a European
decision."
</P>
<P>
Under the British programme, unveiled on Wednesday, 50 billion
pounds (64 billion euros, 87 billion dollars) of taxpayers' money
has been made available to buy shares in the country's banks.
</P>
<P>
Across the Atlantic, Paulson has a 700-billion-dollar pot with
which to act since Congress approved his bail-out plan, initially
focused on buying out bad loans or so-called "toxic assets" from
banks in difficulty.
</P>
<P>
Under a five-point G7 "action plan" announced Friday, economic
powers will ensure banks "can raise capital from public as well
as private sources in sufficient amounts to re-establish
confidence."
</P>
<P>
Merkel and Sarkozy were to hold their talks in Colombey, the
village east of Paris that hosted the famous summit between their
predecessors De Gaulle and Konrad Adenauer 50 years earlier, on
Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The leaders were to give a news conference at 3:00pm (1300 GMT).
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Merkel and Sarkozy and their 13 colleagues from the
other members of the single-currency bloc will hold a crisis
summit in Paris.
</P>
<P>
Some of the eurozone leaders were annoyed at being locked out of
last week's talks, and Spain's Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez
Zapatero had called for a full meeting of members on Friday when
he visited Sarkozy.
</P>
<P>
The president of the European Commission Jose Manuel Barroso and
the chairman of the European Central Bank Jean-Claude Trichet
have also been invited to Sunday's meeting at 5:00pm (1500 GMT)
in the Elysee Palace.
