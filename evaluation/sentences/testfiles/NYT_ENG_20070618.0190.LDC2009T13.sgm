<HEADLINE>
RADIOLOGY WAS YOUNG, AND SO WAS I: A REMINISCENCE
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Some people are born with silver spoons in their mouths. I grew
up in a lead cocoon.
</P>
<P>
My father, Dr. William S. Altman, known as Sol, was a
radiologist, and his office and its X-ray machines occupied the
first floor of our house in Quincy, Mass. To protect his staff
members, his patients and our family from scatter radiation, he
lined many walls, floors and doors with lead sheets. We learned
to open and close those heavy doors carefully to avoid jamming a
finger.
</P>
<P>
Whether for convenience or frugality, many doctors, even in a
technically oriented field like radiology, practiced in a home
office until shortly after World War II.
</P>
<P>
As I turn 70 today, I am reminded of this piece of Americana that
has largely disappeared. Into the 1970s, X-rays helped detect
many diseases, but changed the course of few.
</P>
<P>
Radiology has made major advances since Wilhelm K. Roentgen
discovered X-rays in 1895 in Germany, providing the first
opportunity to see inside a body without opening it up.
</P>
<P>
CT scans take radiographic slices of the body in details Roentgen
could not have imagined. Interventional radiologists perform
surgery guided by X-ray images to stop bleeding from the
intestines, prevent some strokes and treat other problems. Use of
radium furthered development of other radioactive isotopes that
produce images to detect thyroid and other glandular
abnormalities.
</P>
<P>
These and other imaging techniques not based on radiation, like
ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging, now spare many
patients exploratory operations and improve the precision of
surgery.
</P>
<P>
My father was a man of enormous patience and a wonderful sense of
humor who liked dealing with people. All of that contributed to
an excellent bedside manner. In the early 1930s, after a year in
general medicine, he became one of the first trained radiologists
in this country. He changed fields in part because of a love of
tinkering that he learned from his own father, who was an
electrician.
</P>
<P>
Fully respecting the hazards of radiation, he always wore
cumbersome but protective lead aprons and gloves while working,
unlike some colleagues, who later succumbed to leukemia and other
blood ailments. He lived to 83; those who died younger included
general practitioners who took X-rays in their offices.
</P>
<P>
My father, like many radiologists, split the day between home and
hospital offices.
</P>
<P>
Occasionally he wrote scientific articles and reviews. Twice a
week he volunteered to teach at Tufts University, where he and I
attended medical school, and to join colleagues who shared X-rays
of their most perplexing or interesting cases.
</P>
<P>
Routine use of X-rays caught on slowly in this country. In
important ways, U.S. radiology was a specialty imported from
Germany. In bringing their expertise and equipment, German and
Austrian refugee radiologists made Boston an early national
leader in the field.
</P>
<P>
The name of one, Dr. Richard Schatzki, is now attached to a
circular narrowing of the esophagus -- a Schatzki ring -- that
causes food to stick in the gullet of many patients.
</P>
<P>
In time, American leaders emerged, and they joined the
conferences when visiting Boston. One, Dr. Henry S. Kaplan, cured
a case of Hodgkin's disease with radiation at Stanford, and I
studied with him there as a visiting medical student.
</P>
<P>
Radiologists were said to work regular hours, but that was a
myth. Often a middle-of-the-night call from the hospital would
summon my father to look at the X-rays of accident victims and
patients needing emergency surgery. He considered the trips a
normal part of his job.
</P>
<P>
While emergency X-rays were performed at the local hospital,
office practices handled elective cases. Some patients rang the
office bell because they wanted an X-ray and expected it on
demand, even in the middle of the night. My father explained
calmly that radiologists never accepted a patient without a
doctor's referral.
</P>
<P>
The office telephone also rang in our living quarters because
doctors and patients called at all hours to make appointments. My
mother (Esther), my sister (Dorothy) or I would record an agreed-
upon time in the appointment book and pass on to the patient
instructions like not eating or drinking from midnight before the
day of the requested procedure.
</P>
<P>
Radiologists sometimes made house calls, usually for patients
bedridden with a fractured hip. Dad's "black bag" was a portable
X-ray machine the size of a large suitcase and heavy. Use of
portable X-rays was limited, because the radiation exposure time
was long and the quality of the films seldom matched those taken
in an office.
</P>
<P>
The first-floor waiting room was paneled in knotty pine.
Magazines were piled on stands next to the chairs. To preserve
the quiet atmosphere, my father would not let me take up the
trumpet or drums. (He encouraged me to take piano and clarinet
lessons, but the sour notes I produced upstairs could not have
sounded any better.)
</P>
<P>
Two rooms were for diagnostic X-rays, mostly of bones, lungs,
kidneys and bowels. Mammograms were rarely performed in those
days. Fluoroscopy -- the use of X-rays and a fluorescent screen
to produce images of the body's internal structures, such as the
stomach and intestines -- was a standard procedure, performed in
the dark. To see better, fluoroscopists wore red goggles; because
it took time to adapt vision from light to dark, they would often
wear them for about a half-hour beforehand. When my father went
from the home office to the hospital to do fluoroscopies, my
mother often drove him.
</P>
<P>
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
Dad also performed special procedures. The one he hated most was
a pneumoencephalogram, in which he had to insert a needle in a
patient's lower back, remove spinal fluid and inject air. That
procedure could outline the ventricles in the brain on X-rays.
But the patient invariably suffered an excruciating headache, and
only the rare patient would agree to any additional test. Now the
accuracy of CT and MRI scans have made pneumoencephalograms a
relic of the past, as they have a number of other once-routine
procedures.
</P>
<P>
A third room was for a different form of X-ray -- radiation
therapy. Sometimes it was curative. But mostly it provided
symptomatic relief and palliation, particularly in cancer, making
radiologists known as "the cancer doctors."
</P>
<P>
Before the introduction of steroid drugs, a small blast or two of
radiation often was given for a few benign conditions. One was
bursitis in the shoulder; radiation quickly relieved the pain
and, with exercises, allowed restoration of full shoulder motion.
Now radiation is rarely given for noncancerous ailments.
</P>
<P>
Dad also used radium to treat cancers, mostly those of the cervix
and uterus. He stored the radium in a lead-lined case in a safe
in the cellar.
</P>
<P>
Today, we would call such treatments palliative, though they were
not regarded that way in an era when most cancers were detected
in their late stages. In my youth, chemotherapy was in its
infancy, and people spoke about cancer in euphemisms. In
something rarely seen today, many patients arrived with cancers
that were so advanced they formed festering ulcers. Maggots even
grew in a few such cancers.
</P>
<P>
X-ray films were developed in a darkened room with the type of
chemical solutions used for camera film. A technician mixed fresh
solutions daily, and they stank. Radiologists would give a
preliminary "wet reading" after looking at the X-rays before they
dried. The digital age has eliminated those steps by making X-ray
film obsolete.
</P>
<P>
One convenience of a home office was that my father could go
upstairs to nap. The bathroom doubled as a library, with stacks
of the latest scientific journals.
</P>
<P>
After dinner with the family, Dad went down to the office, stood
before a viewing box, examined each patient's dry X-ray films and
dictated reports far into the night.
</P>
<P>
I do not remember how old I was when I first joined him and
peered over a shoulder at the films. But I have vivid memories of
a number of patients who had large areas in their lung X-rays
that appeared white, instead of the normal black, from silicosis
-- a serious disease that many workers acquired in the local
granite quarries. In such cases, my father taught me to take a
closer look because silicosis increased the risk of tuberculosis.
</P>
<P>
To the untrained eye, X-rays were mostly uninterpretable shadows.
Radiologists learn to look at them in a disciplined, systematic
way. For example, they scan the chest X-rays that were taken at
various angles. Then they look at the lungs, heart and ribs in
detail.
</P>
<P>
"The more experienced eye can take in a complex pattern of
shadows and images almost at a glance and become instinctively
sensitive to an abnormal contour or shadow," said Dr. Joseph T.
Ferrucci Jr., the emeritus chairman of radiology at Boston
University, whose radiologist father was one of my dad's
colleagues.
</P>
<P>
Radiologists and other medical specialists have a different
perspective on patients and their diseases. As one aphorism puts
it: A physician sees a patient at the bedside and imagines the
disease. A radiologist sees the disease on the film and imagines
the patient.
</P>
<P>
As X-ray technology improved, my father often replaced older
machines with newer, larger and more powerful ones that produced
better pictures. Ultimately he had to expand the office to the
point where only a rock garden was left between the front of the
house and the street.
</P>
<P>
The equipment often broke down. When the X-ray repairmen came, my
father joined them in spreading across the floor the diagrams
needed to trace the complex circuitry and pinpoint the problem.
His acumen was so sharp that Harvey Picker, whose company made
X-ray machines, came along. I did not inherit those interests.
</P>
<P>
My father was curious about the causes of the medical problems he
saw and sought ways to prevent them. He drew out epidemiologic
information by talking with patients. For example, he asked
victims of automobile accidents about the model and color of the
cars involved. Because so many victims said the color was dark,
he bought only light-colored cars (much easier to see at night)
and advised others to do likewise.
</P>
<P>
Other conversations and observations convinced him, long before
the 1964 surgeon general's report, that cigarette smoking caused
lung cancer. No one in our household smoked, though relatives who
did died from ailments related to smoking.
</P>
<P>
My father was puzzled by why so many workers at the Fore River
shipyard in Quincy developed mesotheliomas and other cancers. He
tried to persuade the owners to find out why. Doctors later
determined that many were from asbestos. Those anecdotes and
studies kindled my interest in epidemiology.
</P>
<P>
Dad and other radiologists would be irked when referring doctors
failed to communicate the specific symptoms and physical findings
that led them to order a patient's X-rays. Such details help
radiologists know what to look for.
</P>
<P>
The lack of precise information is still is a common problem
between radiologists and referring doctors. And that is a symptom
of a much larger problem: lapses in communication among medical
professionals and the public. It was partly to remedy such
lapses, and partly to inform the public about medicine and its
advances, that I chose the specialty I have pursued for four
decades: medical journalism.
