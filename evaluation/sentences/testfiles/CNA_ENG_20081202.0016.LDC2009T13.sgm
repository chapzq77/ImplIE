A visit to Taiwan by the Dalai Lama, the exiled Tibetan spiritual
leader, would be politically sensitive, and will be left to the
country's security agencies to decide, the head of the Cabinet-
level Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Minister Kao Su-po said the commission would like to see his
visit, but security authorities will make an assessment and come
to a decision first.
</P>
<P>
Kao made the remarks after the Dalai Lama, in an interview with
the Hong Kong- based weekly Yazhou Zhoukan, said to forge
friendly relations with Chinese sisters and brothers and to have
exchanges with Buddhist followers, he would like to visit Taiwan
again if the chance arises.
</P>
<P>
"The commission attaches great importance to the Dalai Lama's
possible  visit, given his high profile in the international
community," Kao said.
</P>
<P>
But in view of China's concerns wherever he goes, "when will be
the appropriate time for the visit and how to arrange his
meetings with political heavyweights in Taiwan will be an issue
that requires careful thought,' Kao said.
</P>
<P>
The Dalai Lama has visited Taiwan twice, in 1997 and 2001,
respectively.
