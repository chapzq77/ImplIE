Pakistan pursuing diplomacy on cross-border raids

ISLAMABAD, Pakistan 2008-09-14 00:20:40 UTC

Pakistan's government has eased its rhetoric against an upsurge
in unilateral U.S. strikes on militant havens near the Afghan
border, saying it hopes quiet diplomacy will persuade Washington
the attacks are only inflaming sentiment against both countries'
leadership.
</P>
<P>
Defense Minister Ahmad Mukhtar claimed Washington has already
agreed to curtail its activities in Pakistan, although a missile
strike Friday killed at least 12 people.
</P>
<P>
The White House declined comment, as it largely has done since
reports emerged Thursday that U.S. President George W. Bush
secretly approved more aggressive cross-border operations in July
as part of a strategy to fight the resurgent Taliban in
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
"We have taken it up at the highest level with the State
Department and Pentagon," Mukhtar said Saturday in what appeared
to be a reference to the use of helicopter-borne U.S. ground
forces in a Sept. 3 attack that killed at least 15. Most cross-
border activity has been limited to missiles fired by unmanned
drones, so the use of commandos represented an escalation.
</P>
<P>
"They have given us assurance that it would not be repeated. The
agreement we have with them is that we will exchange information
and the Pakistan military or para-forces will take action against
terrorists in Pakistan," Mukhtar said.
</P>
<P>
Comments Saturday and Friday night by two top officials seemed to
indicate that the government was trying to avoid an outright
confrontation with Washington, its ally and financial supporter,
after the main opposition party suggested Pakistan should
consider dropping out of the war on terror if the cross-border
attacks continue.
</P>
<P>
Since Aug. 13, there have been at least seven reported missile
strikes, as well as the ground forces operation, in tribally
governed territory where the government has little control. The
border region is considered a likely hiding place for al-Qaida
leader Osama bin Laden and his deputy, Ayman al-Zawahri.
</P>
<P>
A group of tribal elders representing about a half-million people
in the North Waziristan area, where most of the missile attacks
have occurred, threatened Saturday to join forces with Taliban
militants in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
"If America doesn't stop attacks in tribal areas, we will prepare
a lashkar (army) to attack U.S. forces in Afghanistan," tribal
chief Malik Nasrullah told a news conference in Miran Shah, the
area's largest city. "We will also seek support from the tribal
elders in Afghanistan to fight jointly against America."
</P>
<P>
Protests against the U.S. incursions, each drawing about 50
people, were held Saturday in Karachi, Lahore and Quetta by the
Pakistan Tehrik-e-Insaf party of cricket star-turned-politician
Imran Khan. Some carried placards reading, "Bush worst example of
human rights violations."
</P>
<P>
Pakistan's government and military have issued stiff protests to
Washington, although the criticism appeared to be mostly aimed at
soothing domestic anger since Pakistan really has few options to
influence U.S. policy short of opening fire on allied forces or
cutting off relations.
</P>
<P>
Mukhtar repeated Pakistan's contention that it is doing all it
can to fight militancy and is suffering as a result, with more
than 1,000 security forces killed since the country allied itself
with Washington in its war on terror after the Sept. 11, 2001,
attacks in the United States.
