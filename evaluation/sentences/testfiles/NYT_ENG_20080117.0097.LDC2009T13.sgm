REDUCING WATER PRESSURE, LADY BUGS
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Q. I have very high water pressure that measures about 100
(pounds per square inch I think), compared to a normal of 60.
Could I turn the main valve down by half to reduce this pressure?
</P>
<P>
TOO MUCH OOMPH
</P>
<P>
A. I doubt it. There are two aspects to water delivery: Pressure
(how much weight is behind the water flow) and volume (how much
water is being pushed). Closing the intake valve down by a half
or so will reduce the volume but the pressure will stay the same.
But you can do something: Have a plumber install a pressure
reducing valve on the main line coming into the house. This is a
good idea because the high pressure can damage the pipes,
especially the connections.

Q. Two questions: I am getting quite a few lady bugs in the fall
and even in the winter. They often hide in the ruffles of the
curtains. How can I keep them out of the house? Second part: I
have asbestos-cement shingles on my house; a man who came to
paint the siding first power-washed the shingles. Is that
acceptable?
</P>
<P>
CONFUSED
</P>
<P>
A. The lady bugs are, like most insects in fall and winter,
seeking warmth. Keep sweeping them up and tossing them outside;
they will have to take their chances outdoors in winter.
Insecticides are too drastic a control and should not be used
indoors. The bugs may be the Asian Spotted Lady Beetle, which
hitched a ride 20 or so years ago, on a ship sailing from Japan
to a southern US port. From there they proliferated and spread
into many parts of the country. They are harmless, but their
sheer numbers can be a nuisance.
</P>
<P>
Second part: Asbestos-cement should not be power-washed, sanded,
cut, trimmed, sawed, or drilled. That is a problem when paint is
peeling from the shingles, and there is no practical answer. What
might work is carefully hosing off loose paint if that is
possible, and wiping with a wet cloth, then painting with the
hope that the paint will sort of bind any remaining loose paint
together.

Q. My Sears wall oven has developed a loose glass pane in the
double-glazed window of the oven, where the pane fell into the
window cavity. Can I use the oven? I talked to people at Sears
who said they don't make them any more, and were no help. I also
cannot get the door off. If I could, I'd take it to a craftsman
so he can fix it. What can I do?
</P>

A. So much for Sears. Your best bet is to contact a local
appliance dealer. It has been my experience that the local guys
deal exclusively with appliances, and are not only very
knowledgeable but they also aim to please. They want your
business, and want to keep it. Meanwhile, I don't think using the
oven will hurt, except to lose more heat to the kitchen than
usual.
</P>
<P>
Q. I plan to install fiber-cement siding over asbestos-cement
shingles. Can that be done? Where can I find a contractor who
will do this?
</P>
<P>
GEORGE HARRINGTON,Framingham
</P>
<P>
A. Let's put it this way: Vinyl siding installers nail their
siding over asbestos-cement, first applying a bed of styrofoam
insulation to even out the surface and to prevent the asbestos,
when nailed, from falling apart when it is broken up by nailing.
I think it is a terrible practice which eventually could result
in those shards of broken asbestos being released to the air. To
be safe, call your local building department to determine if this
practice can be done. To find a contractor, call a manufacturer
of fiber-cement clapboards. James Hardie is one of these.

Q. I have a moisture problem in my attic. The probable culprit is
a loose-fitting, uninsulated attic hatch, which I intend to fix.
I do have soffit and ridge vents, but I noticed the ridge vents
are completely covered by a foot of snow. Is the solution another
type of vent such as a gable or power vent? Do many houses have
venting in addition to ridge and soffits?
</P>
<P>
JAKE, Pepperell
</P>
<P>
A. Since most of the moisture problem is coming from the attic
hatch, the snow-covered ridge vent will make little difference; I
do not think snow is much of an air stop, so some air is
escaping. But if you insist, to handle the problem of snow
blocking the ridge vent, install large gable vents, which will
help prevent too much moisture in the attic until the snow melts.
Those gable vents may make the ridge-soffit system less
efficient, but I don't think it is a big deal.
</P>
<P>
Blocking and insulating the attic hatch may solve the problem
even without the gable vent. There are trap door covers on the
market, including at Home Depot under the name of Pink Cap. For
