NAVY ADMIRAL NAMED AS NEXT CHAIRMAN OF THE JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF

WASHINGTON - President Bush named Navy Adm. Mike Mullen as the
17th chairman of the joint chiefs of staff on Monday, charging
him to "fight and win" what the administration calls the global
war on terror.
</P>
<P>
With the country struggling through the fifth costly year of
fighting in Iraq, Mullen responded that four decades of Navy
service had prepared him for the job of top military adviser to
the president and the secretary of defense.
</P>
<P>
"I'm ready to take the watch," said Mullen, 60, a former aircraft
carrier battle group commander who has been serving as chief of
naval operations.
</P>
<P>
His most urgent challenge will be to advise Bush on the way
forward in Iraq, where 3,800 U.S. troops have died and 28,000
have been wounded since Bush launched the invasion in March,
2003.
</P>
<P>
"I understand the frustration over the war. I share it," Mullen
said during confirmation hearings before the Senate Armed
Services Committee last July, putting particular emphasis on the
stress the war is placing on U.S. forces and equipment.
</P>
<P>
"There is strain. We are stretched," Mullen testified. "The U.S.
military remains the strongest in all the world, but it is not
unbreakable."
</P>
<P>
Mullen said in his testimony that this year's troop surge was
improving security in Iraq, but only political reconciliation
among Iraqis could lead to a stable country.
</P>
<P>
"Barring that," said Mullen, "no amount of troops and no amount
of time will make much of a difference.'
</P>
<P>
Beneath brilliant October skies, Mullen was sworn in at Fort
Myer, former Civil War fortifications built to defend Washington
against Confederate attack on land confiscated from the family of
Gen. Robert E. Lee.
</P>
<P>
Mullen replaced Gen. Peter Pace, who retired Monday after 40
years and three months in the Marine Corps amid speculation of a
possible political run.
</P>
<P>
On a day when the conservative National Review called on Virginia
Republicans to draft Pace to run next year for the seat of
retiring Sen. John Warner, R-Va., Bush, the titular GOP banner
carrier, signaled his own support for Pace.
</P>
<P>
Bush said the Marine demonstrated an ability to deal with "the
rough and sometimes bitter world of Washington" and was able to
"bring selflessness to a city filled with egos and a dignity to a
political process that might have worn down a lesser man."
</P>
<P>
"I also have a sense that General Pace is not going to end it all
here," said Bush. "He's a man who has always put country first
and he will find new ways to serve."
</P>
<P>
Pace, who caused a stir last spring by saying homosexuality is
"immoral," lashed out at the nation's political climate, saying
"personal venom" often surfaced in lieu of civil dialogue.
</P>
<P>
And, in a dig at congressional Democrats who have introduced
legislation aimed at bringing home U.S. forces from Iraq, Pace
warned against efforts to "vote our way out of a war."
</P>
<P>
"What worries me is that, in some instances right now, we have
individuals who are more interested in making somebody else look
bad than they are in finding the right solution," Pace said in
his farewell address. "They are more interested in letting their
personal venom come forward instead of talking about how do we
get from where we are to where we need to be."
</P>
<P>
Said Pace, "I just want everyone to understand that this dialogue
is not about 'Can we vote our way out of a war?' We have an enemy
who has declared war on us. We are in a war. They want to stop us
from living the way we want to live our lives."
