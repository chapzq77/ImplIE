Ferrari will not waste time second-guessing its efforts after
Felipe Massa lost the Formula One title to Lewis Hamilton on the
final day of the season.
</P>
<P>
"It was an incredible end to the season and once again I think we
have to be proud of what we have done," Domenicali said Monday.
"There is no reason for us to look back and say 'What if? What
if?'"
</P>

In Sunday's Brazilian Grand Prix, McLaren's Hamilton took the
drivers' title by passing Timo Glock on the final turn to take
fifth place and beat race-winner Massa of Ferrari by a single
point in the season standings.
</P>
<P>
Ferrari gained some consolation by taking its eighth
constructors' title in the last 10 years, a feat no team has ever
accomplished before.
</P>
<P>
"It's a great achievement. This year Felipe had two races that
will remain in the history of his growing career. One was
Hungary, where unfortunately we had a problem but he was really
fantastic," Domenicali said on Ferrari's Web site, referring to
when Massa's engine blew while he was leading with three laps to
go.
</P>
<P>
"And then there was (Sunday). I think that Felipe has matured a
lot."
</P>
<P>
Ferrari's other driver, Kimi Raikkonen, finished the season third
in the drivers' standings, after winning last year's title.
</P>
<P>
"This was a difficult year for him," Domenicali said, adding that
he hopes Raikkonen will bounce back like Valentino Rossi did in
winning the MotoGP title this year. "I am expecting the same kind
of approach in 2009."
