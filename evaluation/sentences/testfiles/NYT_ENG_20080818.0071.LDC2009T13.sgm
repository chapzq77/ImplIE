HONDA CR-V THE KING OF THE SMALLER HAULERS
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The world of more expensive gasoline is trying its level best to
bring about the death of big SUVs and pickup trucks. These are
the mammoth haulers, the vehicles a brawny nation needs (or
thinks it needs) and when you load up half a ton of stuff into a
big wagon that already weighs nearly three tons, then hitch a
speedboat to the back, you need a brawny engine to pull it all.
</P>
<P>
That burns gas. Lots of it. What to do? One thing is to scale
back, which is something many of us seem to be doing. Park the
Chevy Suburban and take the bus or train to work. Forego the
weekend waterskiing up at the lake because it could set you back
more than $150 in fuel alone. But we still need to haul people
and things and that's where the smaller SUVs come in -- I prefer
to call them wagons, because that's what they are; they're just a
bit taller than traditional station wagons.
</P>
<P>
The small wagons can easily get in the mid-20s in the mile-per-
gallon sweepstakes and still haul more than 70 cubic feet of
cargo with the second row of seats down. At least, that's what we
found with Honda's 2008 CR-V.
</P>
<P>
The CR-V has become a class-leading favorite in this pack of
smaller haulers, a group populated by some stiff competition --
Edmunds.com lists 26 of them, including the Toyota RAV4, Ford
Escape, Hyundai Tucson, Subaru Forester and Suzuki Grand Vitara
-- and it's done so in quiet way, given that it's been around, in
various forms, since it was introduced in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The current incarnation, which came in the 2007 model year, is
the kind of car where, if you look at it and its predecessors,
you say, "they finally got it right." The first generation CR-V
was kind of a gawky-looking underpowered thing. It was replaced
in 2002 with a more substantial CR-V, but it looked as if the
product planners did the whole inside, then realized they didn't
have a place for the spare tire. So they stuck it on a side-
opening tailgate, which wasn't the most satisfactory solution.
</P>
<P>
Now, the spare tire is underneath the rear cargo platform and the
whole redesign makes the CR-V a far better-looking, far smoother
car, particularly for a station wagon. (They're high, they're
bulky, they're meant to be practical.)
</P>
<P>
The CR-V comes in three trim levels -- LX, EX and EX-L, the L
standing for leather. There's also an EX-L with navigation. You
can get front-wheel-drive or all-wheel-drive. The test model we
had was the most expensive -- the EX-L with navigation -- and my
feeling was that if you're going to have one of these for 10 or
12 years, putting on maybe 150,000 miles, spring for the one with
the goodies.
</P>
<P>
For years, I've thought navigation units were superfluous and too
expensive -- you can buy a portable unit for much, much less, and
you can move it from car to car.
</P>
<P>
But the built-in navis have large screens and you don't have to
worry as much about having them stolen.
</P>
<P>
And speaking of the CR-V's navigation unit, when the nav lady
speaks, the volume on the audio system conveniently dips low and
then recovers its full voice when Ms. Navi is done telling you to
make that turn.
</P>
<P>
Inside, Honda has made this crossover car as comfortable as you
can get, given it's still a utility vehicle, and it handles
highways and smaller byways fine. But it's not an Accord and you
aren't going to get that smoother, less jouncy sedan ride that
you might expect.
</P>
<P>
The dash is laid out logically, with the two requisite tach and
speedo pods, and you also get such niceties as a bar meter that
tells you what kind of mileage you're getting. (In a 950-mile
trip, we averaged 25.6 miles per gallon, and we weren't exactly
lazing along. Try that in your Suburban.)
</P>
<P>
Honda could, however, take a leaf from Toyota's RAV4 playbook and
give CR-V customers a choice of a four-cylinder or a V6. The CR-V
has a 2.4-liter, 166-horsepower engine and it's, well, adequate
to the task, but you do feel and hear that four-cylinder buzz
when you hit that freeway on-ramp. The CR-V and RAV4 four-
cylinder have identical (22 mpg) mileage figures in the new
federal government calculations. The RAV4 V6 version, smoother
and more powerful than the two four-bangers, suffers only one mpg
by comparison.
</P>
<P>
Other small nits on the CR-V: I liked the stiff panel over the
cargo area, but thought it could be higher  at the level of the
tops of the rear seats. As it is, you can slide a suitcase or two
under it, but the space above is wasted since you can only put a
max of 20 pounds on the shelf itself. Oddly enough, Honda sells a
separate accessory retractable cargo cover that fits over the top
part of the cargo area, but you have to go to the Honda parts
counter and part with $240 to get it.
</P>
<P>
But it's hard to find much fault with this little SUV. It has
plenty of space for five people, it has Honda's vaunted
reputation for reliability, and it's not going to break the piggy
bank when it's time to fill the tank.
