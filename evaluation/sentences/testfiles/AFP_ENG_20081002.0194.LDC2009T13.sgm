Britain's top cop quits after racism, shooting rows
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Britain's top policeman, Metropolitan Police chief Ian Blair,
announced his resignation Thursday after months of mounting
pressure, notably over racism allegations and a mistaken killing.
</P>
<P>
Blair, who came to office shortly before suicide bombings in
London in July 2005, said he had lost the backing of new London
mayor Boris Johnson,, who took office in May.
</P>
<P>
"I have today offered my resignation as commissioner to the Home
Secretary, .. she has reluctantly but graciously accepted," he
told a hastily-arranged press conference, adding that he would
stand down on December 1.
</P>
<P>
"Without the mayor's backing I do not consider that I can
continue in the job," he added.
</P>
<P>
Blair has long faced criticism over the death of Jean Charles de
Menezes, an innocent Brazilian shot dead by police who mistook
him for a suicide bomber in the wake of July 2005 bombings in
London, which killed 56.
</P>
<P>
Then in August the Met's top Muslim officer, Assistant
Commissioner Tarique Ghaffur, confirmed that he was taking Blair
to an employment tribunal over alleged racism.
</P>
<P>
And a new media report Thursday claimed that Blair had used
public money to pay a close friend more than 15,000 pounds
(26,400 dollars, 19,000 euros) to help him sharpen up his image
when he became Met chief in 2005.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Mail reported that the friend, who had known Blair for
30 years, was the owner of a company that won a contract to help
him "make the transition." The friend had received more than
three million pounds' worth of police contract work.
</P>
<P>
The Guardian newspaper said on its online version that it had
been the Daily Mail report that had apparently prompted Blair's
expected resignation.
</P>
<P>
The De Menezes killing has been the main cloud hanging over him.
Scotland Yard was heavily criticised in a report in August 2007
on the killing, although Blair himself escaped censure.
</P>
<P>
The pressure mounted on him last November after his police force
was found guilty of breaching health and safety laws in the
shooting.
</P>
<P>
But he fought off calls for his resignation, saying officers had
done their best in a "simply extraordinary situation."
</P>
<P>
An inquest into the killing is currently underway in London.
</P>
<P>
Some commentators feel that Blair's position was made less secure
by the election of conservative Johnson as London mayor.
</P>
<P>
Former mayor Ken Livingstone had staunchly defended Blair through
repeated storms, but Johnson was clearly cooler, and has not
publicly backed the Met chief.
</P>
<P>
Among the favourites to succeed him is Hugh Orde, the chief
constable of the Police Service of Northern Ireland; Blair's
deputy Paul Stephenson, 54; and Ronnie Flanagan, the Chief
Inspector of Constabulary.
</P>
<P>
Speaking before Blair's resignation was confirmed, Orde said: "I
have two years of my contract left here, I have no plans to move
at the moment."
