NEW YORK 2008-05-19 15:55:52 UTC

<P>
Thomson Reuters Corp. will cut 1,500 jobs as the newly combined
financial and professional information provider moves to
consolidate operations and reduce costs, a person familiar with
the matter said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Thomson Reuters had been widely expected to eliminate overlaps
between the companies and make cut jobs following Thomson Corp.'s
acquisition of Reuters Group PLC on April 17.
</P>
<P>
Thomson, a Canadian company that sells legal, professional and
market information, paid about $15.8 billion (euro10.14 billion)
to acquire Reuters, a London-based financial news and information
company.
</P>
<P>
The cuts represent about 3 percent of Thomson Reuters' global
work force of about 50,000.
</P>
<P>
The person familiar with the situation, who asked to remain
anonymous since there was no formal announcement of the job cuts,
said the layoffs would be completed by the end of the year, and
include about 140 editorial positions.
</P>
<P>
The person would not say where the job were planned.
</P>
<P>
Thomson and Reuters have several areas of overlap, including some
news operations as well as services that provide earnings
estimates for publicly traded companies.
</P>
<P>
The company had said on May 1 when it reported earnings that it
expected to see annual cost savings of up to $1 billion (euro640
million) by the end of 2010, earlier than had been previously
expected.
</P>
<P>
In addition to financial news and data, the company is also a
major information provider to the legal, medical, tax and
accounting professions.
</P>
<P>
Thomson Reuters shares rose 32 cents to $32.97 Monday.
