DUBAI, United Arab Emirates 2007-11-16 12:29:33 UTC

The Emirates' national air carrier denied Friday that any of its
employees were among 10 people injured when an Airbus jet slammed
into a wall during ground tests a day earlier.
</P>
<P>
An Airbus spokesman also corrected the company's statement late
Thursday that seven employees of Etihad Airways were injured,
saying they in fact worked for a firm contracted to test the
plane.

<P>
Ten people were injured Thursday during engine tests of an Airbus
340-600 near the southwestern French city of Toulouse shortly
before the jet was scheduled to be delivered to Abu Dhabi-based
Etihad.
</P>
<P>
Airbus said nine people on board were injured in the accident,
along with one person on the ground.
</P>
<P>
Airbus Chief Operating Officer Fabrice Bregier said late Thursday
that seven Etihad employees were among the wounded. "It was
normal for the client to be present on board the plane," Bregier
said.
</P>
<P>
However, Etihad denied on Friday that any of its employees were
injured. "At the time of the incident, there were no members of
Etihad staff on board of the Airbus plane, which was expected to
be delivered to us next week," said Greg Moore, a spokesman for
the Dubai-based public relations firm Four Communications, which
represents Etihad.
</P>
<P>
Jacques Rocca, an Airbus spokesman, said Friday that the seven
non-Airbus staff on board the plane during the accident were
employees of Abu Dhabi Aircraft Technologies, a contractor
working for Etihad. Calls to the company for comment went
unanswered Friday, the weekend in the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
Airbus said in a statement that most of the wounded had been
released from hospital by Friday. "Of the three persons remaining
in hospital, one is an employee of Abu Dhabi Aircraft
Technologies (ADAT), a service provider for Etihad Airways, and
two are Airbus employees," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The incident took place during a final round of tests before
anticipated delivery, in which the plane's engines are powered up
full-throttle as the brakes are applied.
</P>
<P>
French authorities ordered a technical investigation into the
causes of the accident.
