RugbyU: Asian champions Japan set sights on Pacific Nations
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Japan have their sights set on an improved performance in the
Pacific Nations Cup after sweeping all before them in this year's
inaugural Asian Five Nations tournament.
</P>
<P>
Japan, Asia's top-ranked rugby nation, topped the Five Nations
table with four wins out of four, including victories over South
Korea and Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
South Korea sealed second spot, running in six tries in a
comprehensive 50-24 win over Hong Kong in the southern Chinese
territory on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
In the battle for the wooden spoon, Kazakhstan beat the Arabian
Gulf 56-27, meaning the Gulf side are relegated.
</P>
<P>
Japan coach and former All Black John Kirwan, who took the job
last year and led the country as the only Asian team in the World
Cup in France, sees the Five Nations as a springboard for the
Pacific Nations Cup in June and July -- and for the next World
Cup in 2011.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after Japan sealed the trophy by outclassing Hong Kong
75-29 last week, he said his side still had work to do.
</P>
<P>
"We've worked hard for the last five weeks. We still have plenty
to work on looking forward to the Pacific Nations tournament," he
added.
</P>
<P>
The Brave Blossoms have finished bottom of the pile in the
previous two Pacific competitions.
</P>
<P>
In a warm-up match, Japan will take on the Classic All Blacks on
May 31 at Tokyo's National Stadium.
</P>
<P>
"We'll be tested a lot more against the Classics and we can come
up against more tackles at the Pacific Nations," Kirwan said.
</P>
<P>
The tournament pits 16th-ranked Japan against Fiji, Samoa, the
New Zealand Maoris, Tonga and Australia A.
</P>
<P>
Although all the headlines in this year's Five Nations tournament
have been made by the rampant Japanese, South Korea were
delighted to confirm their position as number two in Asia's
pecking order.
</P>
<P>
Captain Kim Kwang-Mo said a Test defeat to Hong Kong last year
had given his side added motivation and the team looked fired up
as they raced into an early 24-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
"The main motivation was last year. We were shocked last year and
that kept us motivated," he said, adding that he was delighted by
the margin of the victory.
</P>
<P>
Kim refused to be intimidated by the manner of Japan's win this
year, setting his sights on a tournament win in 2009.
</P>
<P>
"The Japanese players' level is very high but if the players
focus and train hard for next year I'm sure we can beat them," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong coach John Walters was disappointed his team failed to
secure second spot but vowed to come back stronger.
</P>
<P>
Saying the Five Nations was "great for Hong Kong and Asia," he
said the side had shown a lot of character and had a solid base
on which to build.
</P>
<P>
"We have got a lot of things in place this year and it will
probably take a couple of years to see the full benefit," he
said.
</P>
<P>
This tournament is the pinnacle of four newly formed tiers of
competition across 25 Asian rugby unions, with the last-placed
team in the top tier, the Arabian Gulf, relegated to the 2009
division one competition.
</P>
<P>
The standard of rugby in Asia lags far behind countries such as
Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and England, but the
International Rugby Board sees plenty of potential here, and the
Five Nations was launched as a platform to develop and expand the
sport across the region.
