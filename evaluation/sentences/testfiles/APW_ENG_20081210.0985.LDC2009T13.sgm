<P>
European stock markets closed mostly higher Wednesday, helped by
gains on Wall Street and relief that U.S. lawmakers are close to
a rescue deal for carmakers.
</P>
<P>
Germany's DAX closed 0.5 percent higher at 4,804.88, while the
French CAC 40 rose 0.7 percent to 3,320.31. Britain's benchmark
FTSE 100 was the only major index to fall, ending 0.5 percent
lower at 4,361.16.
</P>
<P>
The indexes were boosted by a bounce on Wall Street, where the
Dow Jones industrial average was 1.2 percent higher at 8,797.50
in midday New York trading. On Tuesday, the Dow had fallen 242.85
points after logging a total gain of 560 points Friday and
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The improvements come on news that U.S. lawmakers have agreed in
principle on a $15 billion bailout of Detroit's Big Three
automakers that would give the government extraordinary power to
restructure the failing industry.
</P>
<P>
Fears of a possible implosion of the U.S. auto industry have
weighed on stock markets in recent weeks as a failure to come up
with a support package would strike a further blow to the reeling
U.S. labor market.
</P>
<P>
"Markets are bracing for what is now a tentative $15 billion
package for Detroit as a possible source of cushion before the
U.S. data schedule resurfaces" with jobs data Thursday and retail
sales on Friday, said Ashraf Laidi, chief market strategist at
CMC Markets.
</P>
<P>
Those economic releases are likely to remind investors of the
gloom hanging over the U.S. economy, just as poor European
economic figures Wednesday weighed on stocks in early trading.
</P>
<P>
French industrial output in fact posted a stunning drop in
October, down 2.7 percent on the month, due mostly to weaker car
manufacturing. That was the third consecutive monthly decline and
suggests a slump in the auto sector across Europe will weigh
heavily on growth.
</P>
<P>
"With more bad news to come later, industrial performance in the
fourth quarter should prove to be devastating in line with the
worst recession since the 90's," said Isabelle Job, analyst at
Credit Agricole's Calyon.
</P>
<P>
In Sweden, ball bearings maker SKF AB said it would slash 6
percent of its work force worldwide, increasing fears that the
pain in the auto sector is already being passed onto its
suppliers. In Britain, a well-respected think tank said it
expected the economy to shrink sharply in the fourth quarter,
causing the pound to hit record lows against the euro.
</P>
<P>
Despite such dismal economic data, news of the U.S. auto sector
bailout was enough to cause equities to rise in most parts of the
world.
</P>
<P>
Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 stock average earlier rose 264.37
points, or 3.2 percent, to close at 8,660.24. Carmakers led the
rally: Honda Motor Co. vaulted 10.3 percent, Toyota Motor Corp.
jumped 6.5 percent and Nissan Motor Co. rose 5.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's Hang Seng index advanced 5.6 percent to finish at
15,577.74. Benchmark indexes in Australia, South Korea, India,
China and Singapore also rose, although New Zealand's market
closed lower.
</P>
<P>
"Investors welcomed the news of congressional agreement to rescue
the Big Three automakers, which came after Wall Street closed,"
said Kazuhiro Takahashi, equity general manager at Daiwa
Securities SMBC, in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
Investors in Hong Kong snapped up Chinese stocks as they expected
the country's top planners would emerge with additional measures
to spur economic growth after a high-level economic planning
meeting.
</P>
<P>
"Because of the global economic downturn, China has no choice but
to change its policy completely to take a more stimulus-oriented
approach," said Francis Lun, general manager of Fulbright
Securities Ltd. in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
ICBC, China's largest bank, climbed 5.9 percent and China
Construction Bank advanced 5.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
Japanese electronics maker Sony Corp. overcame an initial fall to
rise 1.1 percent after announcing Tuesday it will cut 8,000 jobs
-- 4 percent of its worldwide work force -- to rein in spending
and shutter plants as it tries to ride out a looming worldwide
recession that is battering Japan's export-reliant manufacturers.
The Australian stock market bounced back from a slow morning,
overcoming the negative lead from Wall Street the day before to
close 1 percent higher as resources stocks rallied.
</P>
<P>
BHP Billiton, the world's largest mining company, jumped 6.7
percent and rival Rio Tinto soared 12.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
Rio announced after the market closed that it will cut 14,000
jobs worldwide, reduce capital investment and sell assets to try
and trim 10 billion Australian dollars ($6.6 billion) from its
debt by the end of next year as it copes with waning demand for
iron ore and other metals.
</P>
<P>
Light, sweet crude for January delivery was up $0.91 to $42.98 a
barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange
by late afternoon in Singapore. The contract fell overnight $1.64
to settle at $42.07.
