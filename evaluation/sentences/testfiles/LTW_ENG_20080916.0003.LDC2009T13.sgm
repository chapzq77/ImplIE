The following editorial appeared in Monday's Washington Post:

As you might expect, the subject of a recent American Academy of
Actuaries forum was rather technical: the standards that state
and local pension plans use to determine how much to invest to
keep their retirement promises to government workers. While eye-
glazing, this topic is critically important to state and local
taxpayers because some of them may get stuck with an unexpected
pension bill unless the actuaries, and the Governmental
Accounting Standards Board (GASB), which will receive their
recommendations, take a stand for accuracy and full disclosure.

As The Washington Post reported this month, state and local
government pension plans, unlike many private-sector plans, are
allowed to calculate the adequacy of their funding based on
relatively rosy projections about their earnings. Instead of
assuming a rate of return pegged to the lowest-risk investment, a
30-year Treasury bond (currently about 4 percent), they typically
use a benchmark of 8 percent, which implies that they will do
very well for very long periods in the riskier stock and bond
markets. How likely is that? As Berkshire Hathaway Chairman
Warren E. Buffett (a member of The Washington Post Co.'s board)
noted in a recent letter to his shareholders, the Dow Jones
industrial average, currently hovering around 11,000, would have
to hit about 2,000,000 by the end of this century just to match
the 5.3 percent annual rate of return stocks yielded in the last
one.

Now, we have nothing against optimism, but in this case, it
permits state and local officials to make sweet promises -- high
benefits, low retirement ages -- to civil servants without having
to raise the funds that might actually be necessary to keep them.
This may not be good policy, but it's good politics since
officials who make unrealistic commitments usually aren't around
when they come due. To be sure, most pension funds are
financially sound: 58 percent, according to a recent study by the
Government Accountability Office. Even those that are underfunded
are still meeting current obligations. Unlike private firms,
governments probably should not accumulate surpluses in their
pension funds because that creates political pressure to raid the
excess for spending. And, unlike private firms, governments
generally do not go bankrupt.

Still, it's not impossible. The city of Vallejo, Calif., declared
bankruptcy in May, partly because it had granted police and
firefighters six-figure pensions that kicked in at age 50. The
U.S. population is aging, and long-term inflation is a fact of
life. The actuaries and the GASB should urge state and local
governments to play by more cautious -- and more transparent --
rules. For taxpayers trying to understand their governments' true
pension liabilities, the best surprise is no surprise.
