CONSUMERS ON HEALTH CARE: DIAGNOSIS IS IT ' S BROKEN
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, Va.
</P>
<P>
When a dozen consumers gathered over the weekend to discuss
health care at the behest of President-elect Barack Obama, they
quickly agreed on one point: They despise health insurance
companies.
</P>
<P>
They also agreed that health care was a right; that insurance
should cover "everything," not just some services; and that
coverage should be readily available from the government, as well
as from employers.
</P>
<P>
Those were the conclusions of a house party held here in Northern
Virginia at the home of Karima Hijane and Theodore A. Kolovos,
information technology consultants who have been married for
seven years. It was one of more than 4,200 such events being held
around the country Dec. 15-31, as part of an experiment in grass-
roots politics and policy-making, to provide recommendations to
the president-elect.
</P>
<P>
One of the people seated around Hijane's dining room table, Bruce
D. Chatman, worked for IBM for 29 years. Corporations, he said,
have too much influence in the legislative process and the health
care system. He wants to counterbalance their power with the
energy and passion of citizens lobbying for themselves.
</P>
<P>
Shiva S. Makki, an economist, complained that in many cases,
insurers did not cover the costs of screening procedures and
preventive care.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Lawrence M. Nelson, a scientist at the National Institutes of
Health who emphasized that he was speaking as a private citizen,
said: "The incentives in the current health insurance system are
upside down. The less care you provide, the bigger your profits."
</P>
<P>
Nelson said he liked Obama's proposal to create a new public
plan, similar to Medicare, that would compete with private
insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
Hamudi Almasri, a 35-year-old information technology consultant,
said that when he changed jobs, he had to change health plans and
doctors. "If I change employers, why should it be such a hassle?"
Almasri asked.
</P>
<P>
The Obama transition team did not ask people how a new health
care system should be financed, but several people here said that
individuals and businesses should have to pay a small health care
tax -- some preferred to call it a "contribution" -- so that
everyone could be covered.
</P>
<P>
Chatman said he expected insurance companies and others in the
health care industry to resist many of Obama's proposals.
</P>
<P>
"This is warfare for the health care of our country," Chatman
said. "The question is, Will money win, or will the people win?
If we lose, we'll be a second-class country."
