German, French leaders call for unity on toughening Iran
sanctions

<P>
The German and French leaders called Monday for Russia and China
to help increase pressure on Iran over its disputed nuclear
program, and French President Nicolas Sarkozy said that Tehran
must get "no nuclear weapon."
</P>
<P>
Sarkozy recently has led European calls for tougher sanctions
against Iran over its defiance of U.N. Security Council demands
to halt uranium enrichment, which could be used both to generate
nuclear power and create the fissile core of warheads.
</P>
<P>
While France has suggested new European Union economic sanctions
against Iran, Chancellor Angela Merkel has made clear that
Germany wants to concentrate on negotiating sanctions at the U.N.
</P>
<P>
Merkel said after the two countries' Cabinets held a twice-yearly
meeting that there was "a very great level of agreement" on Iran.
</P>
<P>
The two have "the common position that, if Iran does not change
its stance, further sanctions must be considered in the U.N.
framework," she told reporters at the chancellery. "We want to
have Russia and China in the world community that makes clear to
Iran that we cannot resign ourselves to this nuclear program."
</P>
<P>
Russia and China, both veto-wielding permanent members of the
Security Council, so far have been skeptical about further
sanctions, advocated by the United States and other Western
countries.
</P>
<P>
Sarkozy said that both Germany and France "believe in the
usefulness of sanctions."
</P>
<P>
"Germany and France think that, for sanctions to be efficient,
there must be unity in the international community, including
China and Russia, and that we must maintain the line of dialogue
at the same time as firm sanctions," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We may have a problem of pace here or there, but on the big
picture of this policy we are on the same wavelength: no nuclear
weapon for Iran," Sarkozy said. "The door remains open, but the
sanctions are toughening."
</P>
<P>
Both Sarkozy and Merkel have discussed Iran with U.S. President
George W. Bush during separate trans-Atlantic trips over the past
week. Merkel has said she and Bush agreed that a diplomatic
solution to the issue is still possible.
</P>
<P>
Merkel stressed on Monday that European countries "want to reduce
our own trade relations with Iran," noting the German government
was restricting export guarantees and German banks had moved to
halt business with Iran.
</P>
<P>
Before their meeting at the chancellery, Merkel and Sarkozy went
to a Berlin school to debate the challenges of integrating
immigrants.
</P>
<P>
Sarkozy, who has pushed legislation that institutes tests of
language and fundamental French values, pressed home his argument
that immigration needs to be controlled. "If we do not have the
courage to master migratory flows, we will not succeed with
integration," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Our countries are open; they are not closed, they are not
fortresses," he said. "But anyone who asks to come must respect
the culture he wants to become his own."
</P>
<P>
Berlin police said a 25-year-old man was detained after shouting
insults at Merkel from the crowd after she visited the school
with Sarkozy.
