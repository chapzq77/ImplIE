Spanair faults 'imprecisions' in preliminary crash report
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A preliminary report into last month's Spanair plane crash in
Madrid which killed 154 people contains "imprecisions," a senior
airline official has said.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the airline failed to perform a routine
check recommended by the manufacturer, but Spanair director of
operations Javier Muela rejected its initial findings in an
interview with radio Cadena Ser late on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"It seems to us very preliminary at the moment, full of many
imprecisions," Muela said.
</P>
<P>
Spanish media published leaked extracts of the report on Tuesday
which said the MD-82's wing flaps were not properly extended when
it attempted to take off, causing it to lose altitude and land on
its tail before catching fire.
</P>
<P>
The pilots were not aware of the problem until it was too late
because a warning alarm failed to work, according to segments of
the report published in daily newspapers El Pais and El Mundo.
</P>
<P>
Boeing began recommending that the warning system be checked by
pilots before every flight following the crash of another MD-82
plane, in 1987 in Detroit, USA, that also killed 154 people, the
newspapers reported.
</P>
<P>
Spanair, however, only asks its pilots to verify the alarm before
the first flight of the day and after a change in the pilot team,
they said.
</P>
<P>
The plane had carried out an earlier flight from Barcelona with
the same crew.
</P>
<P>
Muela also said that Boeing made the recommendation one year
before Spanair, a unit of Scandinavian carrier SAS, was set up in
1988 and it was not informed by the plane maker of the need to
verify the alarm.
</P>
<P>
It is company policy is to check the flaps three times before
every flight, he added.
</P>
<P>
Only 18 people survived after the packed plane slammed into the
ground and burst into flames just seconds after taking off August
20 from Madrid's airport for Las Palmas in Spain's Canary
Islands.
</P>
<P>
A funeral mass will be held later on Wednesday in Las Palmas for
the victims of the crash, Spain's worst air accident in 25 years,
which will be attended by Spanish Prime Minister Jose Luis
Rodriguez Zapatero.
