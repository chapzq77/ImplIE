Canada, which has been accused of being responsible for 20 to 25
percent of all pirated movies, is considering legislation that
would make it a criminal offense to record movies in theaters.
</P>
<P>
Last month, Warner Bros. threatened to cancel all of its advance
screenings in Canada and accused the country of being at the
forefront of the piracy market.

It is currently not a criminal offense in Canada to make
recordings of movies in theaters for personal use. Under a new
bill introduced Friday, recording a movie without permission can
bring up to two years in jail, while taping a film for later sale
or rental could carry a five-year penalty.

The movie industry has lobbied for years for a crackdown, saying
piracy costs it US$6 billion (euro4.5 billion) dollars a year.

In a meeting Wednesday, Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper
promised California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger that Canada
would crack down on piracy.

<P>
Canadian Heritage Minister Bev Oda said the legislation averts a
Warner Bros. threat to cancel Canadian preview showings of likely
summer hits such as the latest Harry Potter sequel.

Oda said she has been told that Canada may be responsible for 20
to 25 percent of all pirated movies.
