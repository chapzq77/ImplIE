German consumers keep cool amid financial turmoil: GfK
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
German consumers have shown a comparatively level-headed reaction
to ongoing financial turmoil, with a key confidence index
compiled by the GfK institute stabilising "at a low level," it
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The forecast index edged up to 1.9 points for November from 1.8
points this month, but "in spite of the financial crisis and some
turbulent times on the stock market," the consumer climate
"appeared to stabilise at a low level," the Nuremberg-based
institute said.
</P>
<P>
"Consumers have kept a level head amid the sometimes dramatic
developments on the international financial markets, and this is
particularly true of their income expectations," GfK said.
</P>
<P>
Fears of a recession have been reinforced, however.
</P>
<P>
"Major contributing factors are the panic on the international
stock exchanges, which has shaken consumer confidence in the
future economic outlook," it added.
</P>
<P>
That resulted in an economic expectations sub index plunging by
11.8 points to minus 27.5 points, its lowest level since May
2003.
</P>
<P>
The German government expects the economy to grow by just 0.2
percent next year, with the economy ministry noting last week
that "weakness of the global economy has weighed on exports," the
engine of German growth.
</P>
<P>
And although consumers believed their disposable income was set
to rise slightly, their propensity to make large purchases was
limited, the study found.
</P>
<P>
The auto and construction sectors have already begun to suffer.
</P>
<P>
German auto makers have curtailed production in certain cases and
issued profit warnings in others.
</P>
<P>
The GfK study questioned 2,000 people before signs suggested the
initial banking crisis was spreading to the economy in general
and before the German government announced a 480-billion-euro
(590-billion-dollar) rescue plan for banks.
</P>
<P>
"It remains to be seen whether the bank rescue package proposed
by the German government in the meantime will provide for more
calm on the stock markets and contribute to a change in consumer
mood," GfK noted.
</P>
<P>
Since the poll was taken, global stock markets have fallen
further on fears that a global economic recession is at hand.
</P>
<P>
Overall, 2008 will not turn out to be a very good year for German
consumers.
</P>
<P>
"All hopes are now being pinned on 2009. It is very much hoped
that consumers regain their confidence in the financial markets
and that a recession can be avoided," GfK said.
</P>
<P>
German business confidence plunged to a five-year low in October,
the widely- watched Ifo business climate index showed Monday, as
the world's leading exporter was hit hard by the global financial
crisis.
