<P>
David Beckham will leave Real Madrid at the end of the season to
join the Los Angeles Galaxy of Major League Soccer in a five-year
deal.
</P>
<P>
The move was announced Thursday following the end of talks on
extending the 31-year-old English midfielder's contract with the
Spanish club.
</P>
<P>
"This week, Real Madrid asked me to make a decision regarding my
future and the offer to extend my contract by a further two
seasons," Beckham said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"After discussing several options with my family and advisers to
either stay here at Madrid or join other major British and
European clubs, I have decided to join the Los Angeles Galaxy and
play in the MLS from August this year."
</P>
<P>
Beckham's four-year contract with Madrid expires at the end of
this season. He joined the team from Manchester United in 2003,
where he had had won six league titles, two FA Cups and the
Champions League title.
</P>
<P>
But Beckham, the world's most recognized player, hasn't won a
major trophy since joining Madrid.
</P>
<P>
"I have enjoyed my time in Spain enormously and I am extremely
grateful to the club for giving me the opportunity to play for
such a great team and their amazing fans," Beckham said.
</P>
<P>
Beckham has been unhappy this season at Madrid under coach Fabio
Capello. He has started only seven of 25 matches and was left off
the squad for Thursday's Copa del Rey match against Real Betis.
</P>
<P>
"For the rest of this season I will continue to give 100 percent
to my coach, teammates and fans as I believe Fabio Capello will
bring this club and its supporters the success they truly
deserve," said Beckham, who trained with Madrid in the Spanish
capital Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Before the season started, Beckham led England to the
quarterfinals of the World Cup, scoring from a free kick in the
second round to beat Ecuador 1-0.
</P>
<P>
But he was taken off the field early in the second half against
Portugal with ankle and Achilles tendon injuries, and then
watched as his team was eliminated in a penalty shootout.
</P>
<P>
A day after the game, Beckham stepped down as captain of the team
-- a post he had held for 58 of his 94 international appearances.
Then, on Aug. 11, England coach Steve McClaren dropped Beckham
from the team altogether, signaling the end of his international
career.
</P>
<P>
Then came more heartache in Madrid.
</P>
<P>
He was injured in November when he was allowed to travel to Rome
to visit Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes, but Beckham was forced to
skip the wedding and return to Madrid to sit on the bench --
another sign that his days in Madrid under Capello were numbered.
</P>
<P>
Still, the move to Los Angeles won't surprise many people.
Beckham has a soccer academy in Carson, California, and his wife
Victoria, a former Spice Girl, was recently photographed house-
hunting in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
MLS recently changed its rules on salary caps, clearing the way
for Beckham to sign a lucrative deal. British news reports put
the LA deal at US$250 million.
</P>
<P>
"I am proud to have played for two of the biggest clubs in
football and I look forward to the new challenge of growing the
world's most popular game in a country that is as passionate
about its sport as my own," Beckham said.
</P>
<P>
Beckham and his wife are worth 87 million pounds (US$169
million), according to Britain's Rich List. Beckham alone
reportedly makes about euro25 million (US$32 million) per year in
salary and endorsements.
