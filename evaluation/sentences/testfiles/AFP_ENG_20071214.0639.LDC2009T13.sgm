Football: West Ham seeking swift revenge on Everton by Robin
Millard
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
West Ham United get an early chance for revenge against Everton
on Saturday, three days after the Toffees dumped them out of the
League Cup quarter-finals. But Everton will be hoping to catch
hosts West Ham off-guard once more at Upton Park when they clash
in the English Premier League, as the east London club get used
to life without Eggert Magnusson.
</P>
<P>
He stepped down as chairman on Thursday, leaving owner and fellow
Icelander Bjorgolfur Gudmundsson in sole charge.
</P>
<P>
The Toffees are on a high, chasing a Champions League spot in the
league and still in the FA, League and UEFA Cups.
</P>
<P>
And the Liverpool club's Nigeria striker Yakubu is in hot form,
scoring his 10th goal of the season with the 88th-minute winner
against the Hammers in Wednesday's 2-1 win at Upton Park.
</P>
<P>
Joseph Yobo, Yakubu's Everton and Nigeria teammate, reckoned West
Ham will be hell-bent on avenging their quarter-final defeat.
</P>
<P>
"It will be really difficult on Saturday and a completely
different game," he told evertonTV.
</P>
<P>
"In football, you can't talk about revenge but West Ham are going
to want to get their own back. We will just go out and do our
best again."
</P>
<P>
But Yobo warned the Hammers to be wary of hitman Yakubu, an 11.25
-million-pound (22.9-million-dollar) purchase from Middlesbrough
in August.
</P>
<P>
"He is always going to score goals when he gets the chance and he
does not miss when he gets chances," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The way we are playing suits Yak at the moment. At first it was
a bit difficult when he came here. Now everyone can see he has
adapted well into the team and everybody is having fun.
</P>
<P>
"He is enjoying himself and the games -- he is more confident so
the goals are just going to come naturally from Yakubu. I think
he has more to come but we will have to wait and see."
</P>
<P>
Everton, unbeaten in 11 league and cup matches, are seventh in
the Premier League table.
</P>
<P>
Buoyant Toffees boss David Moyes said of the West Ham rematch:
"I'm looking forward to coming back on Saturday. Hopefully we'll
do the same again, and play the same way again."
</P>
<P>
Everton are five points ahead of the Hammers, who are 10th. West
Ham boss Alan Curbishley is starting his second year in charge
with the club in a much better position than when he took over.
</P>
<P>
Last December, the Hammers had 14 points from 17 games and seemed
doomed to relegation.
</P>
<P>
But now the club is chasing a UEFA Cup spot and hoping this
week's boardroom shake-up can keep West Ham aiming high.
</P>
<P>
Banker Gudmundsson bought Magnusson's five-percent stake in the
Hammers and invested a further 30.5 million pounds into the club.
</P>
<P>
But he made clear his cash injection is targeted towards firming
up the club's financial base for the future, meaning that a new
stadium will be the spending priority rather than new players in
the January transfer window.
</P>
<P>
That could mean boss Alan Curbishley may have to go without
bringing in cover for Craig Bellamy.
</P>
<P>
The Wales striker has spent six weeks out recovering from surgery
on a persistent abdominal injury, but the problem has not gone
away and he may now require further surgery to correct the
problem.
</P>
<P>
"We have to decide this week where we are going to go with
Craig," Curbishley said.
</P>
<P>
"We have to decide whether to continue with the route we are
going down which, if it is successful, will result in a shorter
route.
</P>
<P>
"We may have to go down the surgery route which will be a longer
one. If that is the case I can't put a time-frame on it."
</P>
<P>
Gudmundsson is keek to put his money into a new 60,000-seater
stadium. A potential new site has been identified in the West Ham
area.
</P>
<P>
"My job as owner is to help plan for the future and create the
right conditions off the field to help Alan Curbishley and the
playing squad deliver success on the field," Iceland's second-
richest man said.
