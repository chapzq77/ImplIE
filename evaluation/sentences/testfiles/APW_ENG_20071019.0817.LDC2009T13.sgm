Chelsea defender John Terry is out for three weeks after he had
surgery Friday on the knee problem that ruled him out of
England's last two matches.
</P>
<P>
Terry missed last week's 3-0 win over Estonia with the injury and
then aggravated the problem in training, forcing him to sit out
the 2-1 loss in Russia that hit England's hopes of qualifying for
next year's European Championship.
</P>
<P>
He had only just returned from a broken cheekbone, but will now
miss Premier League games against Middlesbrough, Manchester City
and Wigan, as well as a Champions League match with Schalke.
</P>
<P>
"John tried his best to be available for the national team and
then in the last moment of the training, he got injured again,"
Chelsea coach Avram Grant said. "He needed the operation today
and I hope that everything will be well."
</P>
<P>
Chelsea's attempt to improve on a faltering start to the season
took another hit when left back Ashley Cole was ruled out for
four weeks after damaging his ankle ligaments in England's win
against Estonia.
