Iraq's Parliament Approves Governing Quotas
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Also Monday, three bombs in Baghdad killed at least seven people,
most of them at a busy square targeted by twin blasts that
exploded seconds apart during morning rush hour. Another bomb
north of the capital killed one person and contributed to a day
of violence that underscored the ongoing tensions in Iraq even as
it enjoys a period of relative tranquillity.No date has been set
for the provincial vote, but it is due to take place by Jan. 31
and has been heralded as key to undoing lopsided power structures
blamed for fueling sectarian violence. The minority quota formula
approved by lawmakers would guarantee a total of six seats spread
across three provincial councils to Christians and three smaller
minority groups: Yazidis, Sabians and Shabaks.
</P>
<P>
Of the 150 lawmakers present, 106 voted for the plan. It sets
aside one seat for Christian parties on the provincial councils
of Baghdad, Ninevah, and Basra. Sabians, a pacifist religious
sect, will also receive one seat in Baghdad. Yazidis, from
another religious sect, and Shabaks, an ethnic minority, will
each have one seat on the Ninevah council.
</P>
<P>
Like Christians, the other groups have claimed persecution under
the Shiite Muslim-led Iraqi government and demanded special
protection when parliament in September passed the law setting
the stage for provincial elections. That law failed to include
special considerations for parties representing minorities,
prompting protests by Christian lawmakers and weeks of wrangling
to come up with a solution acceptable to small groups and to the
Shiite, Kurdish and Sunni Arab parties vying for dominance.
</P>
<P>
The approved quotas were less generous than those in two other
proposals which would have granted a total of either eight or 12
seats to minority parties, and the choice illustrated the fears
and distrust among lawmakers in heavily contested, ethnically
mixed areas.
</P>
<P>
Ninevah, in northern Iraq, is particularly sensitive because of
its mixed population largely composed of Sunni Arabs, Kurds,
Christians and Yazidis.
</P>
<P>
Sunnis Arabs had resisted setting aside large minority quotas on
the 37-seat provincial council, fearful that minority groups
might lean toward the Kurds and bolster Kurdish hopes of
expanding their influence in the north. The 12-seat option
rejected Monday would have set aside seven minority seats on the
council.
</P>
<P>
Hassan Alaf, a Sunni Arab lawmaker, said the minorities will
receive the number of seats they deserve based on their
population in the region. "The decision . . . was very fair,"
said Alaf. "We believe granting one seat to each minority is
pretty good and leaves decent room for the larger slates to
compete fairly."
</P>
<P>
Alaf noted that Christian, Yazidi or other minority politicians
could increase their voices in Ninevah by running for office
under the banner of large political blocs. That would guarantee
them their guaranteed one-seat quota, plus more seats if they had
enough public support, he said.
</P>
<P>
"This does not limit their participation or prevent them from
nominating themselves in any slate," he said. "This way, they can
get more seats if they have a good number of votes."
</P>
<P>
But Christian lawmaker Younadem Kana denounced the vote as an
"insult" and said it showed the "fanaticism and racism" of Arabs
fearful of Kurdish influence. He said Arabs had feared Christians
would ally themselves with the Kurds and sought to sabotage this
possibility by blocking the larger quotas.
</P>
<P>
Kurdish lawmakers said they had opposed the bill because it did
not give Christians more guaranteed seats. "The voting of today
showed who is fighting the Christians and who is supporting
them," said Arif Tayfur, a Kurdish political leader and
parliamentarian.
</P>
<P>
The deal must be approved by the nation's three-member presidency
council, and Kana said he would demand a veto. Earlier this year,
Kurds succeeded in putting plans for provincial elections on hold
when President Jalal Talabani, a member of the presidency, vetoed
an election bill that had passed parliament over Kurdish
objections. That forced a re-negotiation of the law and led to
the version passed in September and tweaked in Monday's voting.
</P>
<P>
There was no indication the Christians could force another veto,
although their bitter objections raise the specter of heightened
tensions in the north, which is currently the country's most
violent region. The rest of Iraq has seen a sharp decline in
bloodshed in recent months, but Monday's attacks showed the
lingering instability.
</P>
<P>
The worst blasts occurred seconds apart in front of a police
building in central Baghdad. Six people were killed, including a
14-year-old boy. Cars, shops and a restaurant were damaged, and
the wounded included several police officers.
</P>
<P>
A roadside bomb in eastern Baghdad targeting an Iraqi police
convoy killed one policeman. In Baqouba, the capital of Diyala
province north of Baghdad, a car bomb in the parking lot of the
provincial council exploded, killing one policeman and wounding
10 people.
