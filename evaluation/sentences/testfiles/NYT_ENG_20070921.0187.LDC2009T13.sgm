WASHINGTON
</P>
<P>
Walid Jawad was tired of all the chatter on Middle Eastern blogs
and Internet forums in praise of gory attacks carried out by the
"noble resistance" in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
So Jawad, one of two Arabic-language bloggers for the State
Department, posted his own question: Why was it that many in the
Arab World quickly condemned civilian Palestinian deaths but were
mute about the endless killing of women and children by suicide
bombers in Iraq?
</P>
<P>
Among those who responded was a man named Radad, evidently a
Sunni Muslim, who wrote that many of the dead in Iraq were just
Shiites and describing them in derogatory terms. But others who
answered Jawad said that they, too, wondered why only Palestinian
dead were "martyrs."
</P>
<P>
The discussion tacked back and forth for four days, one of many
such conversations prompted by scores of postings the State
Department has made on about 70 Web sites since it put its two
Arab-American bloggers to work last November. The blogging,
officially known as the Digital Outreach Team, is an attempt to
take a more casual, varied approach to improving America's image
in the Arab World.
</P>
<P>
Brent E. Blaschke, the project director, said the idea is to
reach "swing voters," whom he described as the silent majority of
Muslims who might sympathize with al-Qaida yet be open to
information about U.S. government policy and American values.
</P>
<P>
The department expects to add seven more bloggers within the next
month -- four more in Arabic, two in Farsi and one in Urdu, the
official language of Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
The team concentrates on about a dozen mainstream Web sites --
such as chat rooms set up by the BBC and Al-Jazeera or
charismatic Muslim figures like Amr Khaled, as well as Arab news
sites like Elaph.com. They choose them based on high traffic and
a focus on U.S. policy, and they always identify themselves as
being from the State Department.
</P>
<P>
They avoid radical sites, although team members note that jihadis
troll everywhere.
</P>
<P>
The State Department bloggers themselves said they thought they
would be immediately "flamed," or insulted and blocked from
posting. But so far only the webmaster at the Islamic Falluja
Forums (www.al-faloja.info) has revoked their password and told
them to get lost, the bloggers said.
</P>
<P>
Not that they don't attract plenty of skeptical, sarcastic
responses. One man identifying himself as an Arab in Germany
commented that they were trying to put lipstick on a pig.
</P>
<P>
During congressional testimony last week by Gen. David H.
Petraeus, for example, the two-man team went into chat rooms to
ask people their opinion.
</P>
<P>
"God bless America, the giving mother," went one sarcastic
response, going on to note that everything the United States does
goes into "the balance of your pockets, I mean the balance of
your rewards." Another noted that Iraqis were better off before
the invasion, while a third jokingly asked the Digital Outreach
Team for a green card.
</P>
<P>
Jawad's responses tend toward the earnest: "We do not deny that
the situation in Iraq is difficult, but we are achieving success
in decreasing the level of violence there with the contribution
of the Iraqis who care about their nation and who reject the
terrorists and killers who target their victims based on sect,"
he wrote at one point. He directed the green card writer to the
Web sites describing how to apply.
</P>
<P>
Jawad and his co-blogger, Muath al-Sufi, are circumspect about
biographical details that would allow readers to pigeonhole them
by their roots, religion or education. Jawad, would only say that
he is in his 30s, was born in Texas and raised around the Arab
World. Sufi also said he was in his 30s.
</P>
<P>
The team said certain topics repeat regularly, including
arguments over the accusations that U.S. soldiers tortured Iraqis
at Abu Ghraib and President Bush's comment that the fight against
terrorism is a "crusade." Much time is also spent trying to douse
the Internet brush fires that erupt whenever prominent Americans
from talk-show hosts to politicians make anti-Muslim remarks of
the "bomb Mecca" variety.
</P>
<P>
Each response is carefully crafted in English by the blogging
team and translated into often poetic Arabic.
</P>
<P>
"We try to put ourselves in the mindset of someone receiving the
message," said Duncan MacInnes, the director of the
Counterterrorism Communication Center, of which the bloggers are
one branch. "Freedom for an Arab doesn't necessarily have the
same meaning it has for an American. Honor does. So we might say
terrorism is dishonorable, which resonates more."Analysts said
they had been surprised by the positive response, with people
seemingly eager to engage, although the overall impact is
impossible to assess.
</P>
<P>
"They are not carrying the slogans of liberalization or
democratization across the region," said Adel al-Toraifi, a Saudi
political analyst. "They are talking about peace and dialogue,
and I think that makes it difficult for those debating them to
justify criticizing them."
</P>
<P>
Toraifi said the bloggers had generated some debate in the Arab
World and had been the subject of a column in an Algerian
newspaper lauding the State Department for discussing policy with
ordinary people, something the writer said the Algerian
government would never do. Indeed, several analysts said having
State Department employees on the Web helps to counter one source
of radicalization -- the sense that Washington is too arrogant to
listen to the grievances of ordinary Arabs, so violence is the
sole means to attract attention.
</P>
<P>
Jawad and Sufi say that in their roughly two dozen weekly
postings they avoid all religious discussions, like whether jihad
that kills civilians is legitimate. They even steer clear of
arguments, instead posting straightforward snapshots of U.S.
policy.
</P>
<P>
Jawad is often maligned as a "U.S. agent," including by Radad,
the man of the "just Shiites" remark. After Jawad wrote that all
life was equally worth preserving, part of the man's response was
"Don't you think an agent of Arab nationality deserves to be
killed?"
</P>
<P>
Jawad wrote back in part, "It seems to me that many people are
quick to offer judgments based on political views so those who
oppose them are always agents and infidels. Which leads to law of
the jungle, which is not just, but chaotic."
