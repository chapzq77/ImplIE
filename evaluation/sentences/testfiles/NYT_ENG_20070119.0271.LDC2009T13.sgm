WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. -- No NFL head coach in history besides
Miami's freshly-appointed Cam Cameron can say he played in the
same college career for this who's who of Hoosier coaches: Lee
Corso, Sam Wyche and Bob Knight.
</P>
<P>
Cameron's experience as a two-sport athlete at Indiana in the
early 1980s exposed him to an unusual array of coaching styles -
both at a legendary basketball program and an underdog football
team that had to be innovative to move the ball.
</P>
<P>
Corso said he still sees flashes of things Cameron learned at
Indiana, often by necessity.
</P>
<P>
"We had to do some things different because we were always
undermanned,"
</P>
<P>
Corso said by telephone Friday. "We did things like motions and
shifts because we couldn't outmuscle anybody. Cam was a really
good athlete. He could run, he could throw it. He was probably
the smartest quarterback I ever had."
</P>
<P>
As offensive coordinator for the San Diego Chargers, Cameron
produced the highest-scoring team in the league this season. The
Chargers effectively mixed the rushing of superstar LaDainian
Tomlinson with passing routes as crisply executed as an inbounds
play from Knight's heyday.
</P>
<P>
"I'm thrilled for him to have this opportunity," Knight said in a
statement after practice Friday evening at Texas Tech. "Cam
Cameron is a very bright guy."
</P>
<P>
Cameron inherits a strong defense at Miami, but the main reason
he was hired is to overhaul an unreliable offense. Failure to
move the ball efficiently has been the principal weakness keeping
the Dolphins out of the playoffs for five straight seasons.
</P>
<P>
Corso, now famous for wearing mascot heads as an EPSN analyst,
signed Cameron to Indiana as a quarterback from Terre Haute South
High School, 60 miles cross-state from IU. Corso never imagined
he was recruiting for Knight as well, but Cameron had been a
guard on a high school team that reached the state finals two
years in a row.
</P>
<P>
"What happened was, the basketball team had some injuries, and
Cam came to me about it," Corso recalled. "I said, 'If you can go
with the best coach in basketball, go."'
</P>
<P>
Knight virtually never allowed his athletes to play in two major
sports, but made an exception for Cameron.
</P>
<P>
"When Cam was a college athlete, he played two years as a great
contributor to our basketball team," Knight said. "He accepted
his role, always worked hard, and was tremendously valuable to
our team concept."
</P>
<P>
Cameron went on to become an assistant under Michigan coaching
legend Bo Schembechler, who died two months ago.
</P>
<P>
"Although Bo isn't here to tell you himself, I know he really
liked Cam," Knight said. "Both of us are really proud of Cam."
</P>
<P>
Corso knew Cameron wanted to become a coach, even when Cameron
still was playing in college. That soon became apparent to Wyche,
Corso's coaching successor in Cameron's senior year in 1983.
</P>
<P>
"He was an athlete who studied the game; he didn't just play it,"
said Wyche, a longtime football analyst who now does radio work
for Westwood One. "He would have ideas during the game to suggest
a different
</P>
<P>
blocking scheme."
</P>
<P>
Wyche left after one year at Indiana to take over the Cincinnati
Bengals -- whom he eventually led to a Super Bowl - but has kept
up with his former player over the years while in broadcasting.
</P>
<P>
"He obviously had the players in San Diego, but his first
challenge now is evaluating what he has on offense," Wyche said.
"If he feels like Daunte Culpepper is not going to be a sure
thing, I am sure he will look at bringing in somebody else."
</P>
<P>
Bringing in Cameron is the right move, Corso said.
</P>
<P>
"He's going to build an offense there, but the key is patience,"
Corso said. "It's not going to happen in a month or maybe a year.
But he's going to do it."
