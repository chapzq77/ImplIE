Berlin preparing possible flotation of regional bank LBB
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The city-state authorities of Berlin are preparing a flotation of
the regional bank Landesbank Berlin (LBB) as a possible
alternative to a straightforward sale, a mandatory legal filing
published in the German press revealed on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Berlin has been ordered to sell its 80.95-percent stake in LBB,
which is already listed on the stock exchange, by the EU
competition authorities.
</P>
<P>
And a total 19 groups -- public and private sector banks and
financial investors -- have so far expressed an interest in
buying the stake.
</P>
<P>
But floating the stake on the stock exchange by way of a so-
called secondary public offering (SPO) is now also being seen as
a possible option.
</P>
<P>
A secondary public offering is the issuance of new stock for
public sale from a company that is already listed.
</P>
<P>
According to the legal notice published in the daily Frankfurter
Allgemeine Zeitung, Berlin's advisor bank UBS is asking banks who
would be interested in co-managing the secondary offering to step
forward by April 2.
</P>
<P>
The city-state's finance senator, Thilo Sarrazin, had said in
January that Berlin would chose between the options of a direct
sale and a flotation before June.
