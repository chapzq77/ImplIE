NKorea crisis letting China escape scrutiny: Taiwan
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan's pointman on mainland China warned Tuesday the United
States to keep an eye on Beijing, saying the North Korean nuclear
crisis was letting it escape international scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
"The United States will continue to pay attention to the Korean
peninsula, and that will be an opportunity for China to expand
its influence," Joseph Wu, chairman of Taiwan's Mainland Affairs
Council, said on a visit to Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
"And China can do something against Taiwan to escape the
international scrutiny, especially the American scrutiny," he
told reporters.
</P>
<P>
China is the main ally of North Korea, which tested an atom bomb
in October, and is the host of six-nation disarmament talks
involving the United States that are expected to resume in the
coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
China regards Taiwan, where defeated nationalists fled from the
communists in 1949, as a province awaiting reunification, by
force if necessary.
</P>
<P>
But Taiwan has faced diplomatic setbacks, with seven nations
switching diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing since
independence-leaning President Chen Shui-bian took office in
2000.
</P>
<P>
"The international community has been relatively quiet" on
China's diplomacy to secure diplomatic recognition, Wu said.
</P>
<P>
"China can try to expand its influence in Africa, in Latin
America, in the South Pacific, without the international
attention because the international attention is on the Korean
Peninsula," Wu said.
</P>
<P>
The South Pacific, Africa and Latin America are the main
diplomatic battlegrounds for the two rivals, which accuse each
other of trying to lure away each other's allies with aid.
</P>
<P>
But Wu said relations between Japan and Taiwan are "getting
better and better," pointing to Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo
Abe's recent trip to Europe where he opposed the lifting of the
EU arms embargo on China.
</P>
<P>
Wu pays annual visits to Japan, Taiwan's former colonial ruler.
</P>
<P>
Japan does not recognize Taiwan. It declared Beijing as the only
legitimate government of China when it normalized relations in
1972.
