' MY GRANDFATHER ' S SON ' : THE JUSTICE LOOKS BACK AND SETTLES
OLD SCORES
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Soon after the future Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas
entered the first grade, his destitute mother made a momentous
decision. Unable to provide for her two sons, she sent them to
live with her parents, who owned a small house in the black
section of Savannah, Ga. There they were greeted by Myers
Anderson, known to his grandchildren as Daddy, who announced
brusquely, "The damn vacation is over."
</P>
<P>
It sure was. Daddy, a firm believer in tough love, imposed his
version of martial law immediately. Children were expected to
rise early, work hard and keep their opinions to themselves. No
whining, no excuses, no back talk. If they kept to the program,
they just might end up in what Daddy called "a coat-and-tie job."
</P>
<P>
"Once, years later, I got up the nerve to tell him that slavery
was over," Thomas writes.
</P>
<P>
"Not in my house," his grandfather snapped back.
</P>
<P>
The Jehovah-like Daddy dominates the early chapters of "My
Grandfather's Son," Thomas' selectively revealing, often harshly
self-critical memoir. It's a strange hybrid. The book begins as a
moving evocation of a difficult childhood in the Deep South and,
as Thomas works his way though college and law school, takes on
the outlines of an inspirational American success story.
</P>
<P>
The tone changes when Thomas, fed up with liberal policies on
race, accepts Ronald Reagan's invitation to run the Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission, becoming an object of contempt
and derision for mainstream civil rights organizations. Thomas,
recounting his years in government, adopts a defensive crouch,
lashing out at his enemies, reopening old wounds and itemizing
insults that should be forgotten.
</P>
<P>
All is prelude to the turbulent confirmation hearings for his
appointment to the Supreme Court. Thomas revisits this painful
episode, fresh in his memory, and picks apart the charges leveled
against him by Anita Hill, his former employee at the commission,
in an earnest but ultimately pointless effort to set the record
straight and settle some scores along the way.
</P>
<P>
Here, emotions get the better of him, as he portrays himself as a
persecuted, almost Christlike figure singled out by the liberal
establishment, at the behest of his civil rights enemies, not
just for criticism but also for total annihilation. You wonder
if, when writing these fiery chapters, Thomas recalled his own
admiring words about his grandfather.
</P>
<P>
"Despite the hardships he had faced, there was no bitterness or
self-pity in his heart," he writes in an early chapter. In this
respect Thomas is not his grandfather's son.
</P>
<P>
His critics might not be moved by his political arguments, but
his memoir gives them a man, not a caricature, to attack. Thomas
faced enormous obstacles in life. His deadbeat father, referred
to only as C, abandoned his family to a life of poverty so
extreme that the children did not put sugar on their cereal.
Daddy, whose small fuel-oil business provided a modest income,
sent Clarence to Catholic schools, but the harsh racial
environment in Georgia put enormous pressure on black children
trying to move further than their parents.
</P>
<P>
As one of only two black students at his seminary school, Thomas
experienced panic, followed by "a constant state of controlled
anxiety." The fear of failure haunted him in a way that no white
child could understand, or black parents either, accustomed to
living behind the walls of segregation that were now falling
down.
</P>
<P>
"We had always believed that we could do as well as whites if we
were only given a fair shake -- but what if it turned out that we
weren't good enough after all?" he writes.
</P>
<P>
A fierce sense of discipline and a belief in hard work carried
him from one academic triumph to another, culminating in a law
degree from Yale, a university he grew to despise for reasons not
altogether clear. Along the way he grew an Afro and embraced
radical politics. "The more injustice I saw, the angrier I
became, and the angrier I became, the more injustice I saw," he
writes.
</P>
<P>
What changed was his analysis of who was to blame. Deeply
disturbed by the court-ordered busing of black children to white
schools, he came to the conclusion that liberal policies on race,
especially welfare and affirmative action, were harming rather
than helping blacks.
</P>
<P>
Thomas describes his intellectual journey, and his struggle to
keep body and soul together on meager government pay, in some of
the book's most absorbing and self-critical chapters. He
regretted his early marriage, but for years could not bring
himself to end the relationship and abandon his young son as his
own father had. (Eventually he did.) He began drinking heavily.
His finances were a shambles. At one point a rental-car clerk,
after calling Sears for confirmation, cut up his credit card in
front of him.
</P>
<P>
This is the vulnerable figure his enemies could not see, Thomas
complains, "an ordinary person who, like most people, had worked
out his problems step by unsure step." At the same time,
influenced by thinkers like the free-market economist Thomas
Sowell, he began questioning government intervention as a way to
improve the lot of black Americans. Like his grandfather, he came
to regard welfare as the "ruination"of blacks, embracing instead
a philosophy of total self-reliance.
</P>
<P>
This ideological shift set him on a collision course with
traditional civil rights groups and, he argues, poisoned the
atmosphere around his court appointment. His refusal to accept
"the liberal pieties that had done so much damage to blacks in
America," he writes, "meant that I had to be destroyed."
</P>
<P>
Throughout his life Thomas has met adversity with angry defiance
and iron resolve. Waking up with a hangover one day, he took the
last two beers from his refrigerator, drank them while taking a
hot bath and ended his career as a drinker there and then. When
he looked in the mirror and decided he was out of shape, he vowed
to run a marathon in 100 days, which he did, in fast time.
Overcoming any obstacle, he writes, is "a question of will."
</P>
<P>
In this vein, he writes of overcoming his initial reluctance to
accept the first President Bush's invitation to join the Supreme
Court, an offer he reacted to viscerally: "I felt sick." He
recovered.
</P>
<P>
"Neither then nor at any other time did it occur to me that I
could not do the work of a Supreme Court justice," he writes with
characteristic aplomb. For that self-confidence, there is one
person to thank, his grandfather, and Thomas does, in words of
one syllable.
</P>
<P>
"What I am," he writes, "is what he made me."  PUBLICATION NOTES:
