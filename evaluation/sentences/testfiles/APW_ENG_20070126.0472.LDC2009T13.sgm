International meeting in Japan aims at conserving world ' s
dwindling tuna stocks

KOBE, Japan 2007-01-26 08:19:17 UTC

International regulators adopted a plan Friday aimed at slowing
the decline in global tuna stocks by reining in illegal fishing,
controlling the growth of fleets and sharing data on stock
assessments.
</P>
<P>
The details of the final version were not immediately released,
but delegates hailed it as an important first step in the battle
to keep overfishing from wiping out tuna stocks.
</P>
<P>
"Maybe the steps we made this week seem small, but this is a big
step, a historical step, I think," said the chair of the meeting,
Masanori Miyahara, of Japan's Fisheries Agency.
</P>
<P>
Conservationists, however, expressed disappointment the plan did
not go far enough to put controls on the industry and address the
environmental damage caused by tuna fishing.
</P>
<P>
"We do see this meeting as a failure," said Alistair Graham of
WWF International.
</P>
<P>
The meeting took place amid rising concerns about the
sustainability of the world's tuna supply.
</P>
<P>
The final report had been expected to call for closer
communication among regulators, especially in sharing information
on illegal fishing, scientific calculations of the size of tuna
stocks and other issues, delegates said.
</P>
<P>
"It's a common heritage and it's being destroyed," said David
Bevan, Canadian Fisheries and Oceans assistant deputy minister.
"It needs to be protected."
</P>
<P>
By 2004, for example, the number of adult Atlantic bluefin tuna
capable of spawning had plummeted to roughly 19 percent of the
1975 level in the western half of the ocean, according to the
International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas.
</P>
<P>
The meeting in Kobe, however, also highlighted some of the
conflicts among participants.
</P>
<P>
Japan, for instance, is campaigning for limits on fishing of
smaller tuna, while Europe has resisted the move to protect its
canned tuna industry. Larger countries want to limit fishing
capacity, but poorer island nations want to expand their fleets.
</P>
<P>
Another key issue is stepped-up monitoring of the regulatory
bodies themselves, which have been criticized by conservationists
for failing to stop the depletion of tuna stocks. Some countries,
such as the United States, Canada and Australia, are pushing for
tougher oversight for regulators.
</P>
<P>
"There is a commitment to review performance with a common
methodology," said David Balton, U.S. deputy assistant secretary
of state for oceans and fisheries. "We're looking to create a
scorecard."
</P>
<P>
A major issue at the conference was excess capacity in fishing
fleets.
</P>
<P>
Critics say excess capacity and profits are determining how many
tuna are caught. They argue instead that regulators should decide
how many fish can be caught, and then tailor the size of fleets
to fit those limits.
</P>
<P>
"It's overcapacity that causes a lot of these problems," said
D.G. Webster, a researcher at the Wrigley Institute for
Environmental Studies in Los Angeles, California.
</P>
<P>
Webster, however, was not optimistic about progress on cutting
fishing fleets, in part because it's difficult to move fishermen
into other industries. "It's too hard because nobody wants to
give up boats," she said.
</P>
<P>
Cracking down on so-called tuna pirates was also under
discussion. Overfishing and poaching are largely to blame for
tumbling stocks worldwide, conservationists say.
</P>
<P>
Renegade boats are known to fly the flags of countries with weak
regulations, for instance, knowing that their overfishing will
not be noticed. Smaller boats, meanwhile, are not properly
regulated under current rules.
</P>
<P>
One possibility discussed was electronic tagging of legally
fished tuna when they're caught. Some countries already use
plastic tags, but delegates said that program could be expanded
to cheap, easily traceable electronic tags.
</P>
<P>
Japan's role as host of the Kobe conference is highly symbolic
because it is a major tuna consumer, accounting for 12 percent of
the 2.06 million ton global catch. Japanese eat about a quarter
of the world's supply of the five big species: bluefin, southern
bluefin, bigeye, yellowfin and albacore.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from the commercial fishing industry,
environmental groups and government regulators were attending the
conference.
