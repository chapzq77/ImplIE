Guyana's national police on Sunday renewed its offer of a reward
for information leading to the arrest of gangsters believed
responsible for the killing of a Cabinet minister last year.
</P>
<P>
Police say former Guyanese soldier Rondell Rawlins is the leader
of a gang and one of several black-clad invaders who forced their
way into Agriculture Minister Satyadeo Sawh's home on the
country's coast in late April, killing him along with two of his
siblings and a security guard.
</P>
<P>
Only one suspect in the case has been arrested and charged with
murder. Another man believed to be part of the gang was killed in
a shootout with police in October.
</P>
<P>
First posted in July, the US$10,000 (euro7,900) reward was re-
offered in a bid to capture seven men who police believe are
hiding near Buxton, a village on the South American nation's east
coast.
</P>
<P>
Authorities also allege that Rawlins led the gang in a February
crime spree that killed eight people in the southern district of
Agricola. The group has terrorized the country since 2002, police
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Sawh's murder stunned the former British colony and prompted
authorities to increase security at the homes and offices of
ministers. He was the first Cabinet official since 1979 to be
slain while in office.
