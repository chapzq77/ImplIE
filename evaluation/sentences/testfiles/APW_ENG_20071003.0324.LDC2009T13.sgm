Southern secessionists happy to welcome Yankee colleagues to
Tennessee meeting

<P>
In an unlikely marriage of desire to secede from the United
States, two advocacy groups from opposite political traditions --
New England and the South -- are sitting down to talk.
</P>
<P>
Tired of foreign wars and what they consider right-wing courts,
the Middlebury Institute wants liberal states such as Vermont to
be able to secede peacefully.
</P>
<P>
That sounds just fine to the League of the South, a conservative
group that refuses to give up on Southern independence.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that an independent South, or Hawaii, Alaska, or
Vermont, would be better able to serve the interest of everybody,
regardless of race or ethnicity," said Michael Hill of Killen,
Alabama, president of the League of the South.
</P>
<P>
Separated by hundreds of miles (kilometers) and divergent
political philosophies, the Middlebury Institute and the League
of the South are hosting a two-day Secessionist Convention
starting Wednesday in Chattanooga.
</P>
<P>
They expect to attract supporters from California, Alaska and
Hawaii, inviting anyone who wants to dissolve the union so states
can save themselves from an overbearing federal government.
</P>
<P>
If allowed to go their own way, New Englanders "probably would
allow abortion and have gun control," Hill said, while
Southerners "would probably crack down on illegal immigration
harder than it is being now."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Constitution does not explicitly prohibit secession, but
few people think it is politically viable.
</P>
<P>
Vermont, one of the nation's most liberal states, has become a
hotbed for liberal secessionists, a fringe movement that gained
new traction because of the Iraq war, rising oil prices and the
formation of several pro-secession groups.
</P>
<P>
Thomas Naylor, the founder of one of those groups, the Second
Vermont Republic, said the friendly relationship with the League
of the South did not mean everyone shares all the same beliefs.
</P>
<P>
But Naylor, a retired Duke University professor, said the League
of the South shares his group's opposition to the federal
government and the need to pursue secession.
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't matter if our next president is Condoleezza (Rice) or
Hillary (Clinton), it is going to be grim," said Naylor, adding
that there are secessionist movements in more than 25 states,
including Hawaii, Alaska, New Hampshire, South Carolina and
Texas.
</P>
<P>
The Middlebury Institute, based in Cold Spring, New York, was
started in 2005. Its followers, disillusioned by the Iraq war and
federal imperialism, share the idea of states becoming
independent republics. They contend their movement is growing.
</P>
<P>
The first North American Separatist Convention was held last fall
in Vermont, which, unlike most Southern states, supports civil
unions. Voters there elected a socialist to the U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
Middlebury director Kirpatrick Sale said Hill offered to sponsor
the second secessionist convention, but the co-sponsor
arrangement was intended to show that "the folks up north regard
you as legitimate colleagues."
</P>
<P>
"It bothers me that people have wrongly declared them to be
racists," Sale said.
</P>
<P>
The League of the South says it is not racist, but proudly
displays a Confederate Battle Flag on its banner.
</P>
<P>
Mark Potok, director of the Southern Poverty Law Center's
Intelligence Project, which monitors hate groups, said the League
of the South "has been on our list close to a decade."
</P>
<P>
"What is remarkable and really astounding about this situation is
we see people and institutions who are supposedly on the
progressive left rubbing shoulders with bona fide white
supremacists," Potok said.
</P>
<P>
Sale said the League of the South "has not done or said anything
racist in its 14 years of existence," and that the Southern
Poverty Law Center is not credible.
</P>
<P>
"They call everybody racists," Sale said. "There are, no doubt,
racists in the League of the South, and there are, no doubt,
racists everywhere."
</P>
<P>
Harry Watson, director of the Center For the Study of the
American South and a history professor at the University of North
Carolina at Chapel Hill, said it was a surprise to see The
Middlebury Institute conferring with the League of the South, "an
organization that's associated with a cause that many of us
associate with the preservation of slavery."
</P>
<P>
He said the unlikely partnering "represents the far left and far
right of American politics coming together."
