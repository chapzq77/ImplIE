HIGH-PROFILE INVESTMENTS BRING NEW SCRUTINY TO ABU DHABI FUND
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Abu Dhabi has 10 percent of the world's oil and 0.02 percent of
its population. The result is a surfeit of petrodollars, much of
which is funneled into a secretive, government-controlled
investment fund that is helping to shift the balance of power in
the financial world.
</P>
<P>
After decades in the shadows, the fund, the Abu Dhabi Investment
Authority, is turning heads on Wall Street and in Washington by
making high-profile investments in the United States and
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
Known as ADIA (pronounced ah-DEE-ah), the fund recently formed a
small team that is now buying big stakes in Western companies.
This unit masterminded ADIA's $7.5 billion investment in
Citigroup, the largest U.S. bank, in November. It has also taken
a large position in Toll Brothers, one of America's biggest home
builders.
</P>
<P>
"There is an idea that Abu Dhabi should not be the underdog of
the map," said Frauke Heard-Bey, a historian who has written a
book about the political emergence of the United Arab Emirates.
"They have the money to buy companies that are ailing, and why
should they not? Why not make a mark?"
</P>
<P>
ADIA is the largest of the world's sovereign wealth funds, giant
pools of money controlled by cash-rich governments, particularly
in Asia and Middle East. But Abu Dhabi, the wealthiest of the
seven Arab emirates, says little about its fund. Few outsiders
know for sure where ADIA invests -- or even how much money it
controls. And secrecy breeds hyperbole; some estimates of the
fund's size surpass $1 trillion.
</P>
<P>
Before long, ADIA will certainly reach that mark. But for now
bankers, former employees and analysts familiar with the fund peg
it at $650 billion to $700 billion -- an amount that is still
more than 15 times the size of the Fidelity Magellan Fund. In
all, sovereign wealth funds in countries like the United Arab
Emirates, Kuwait, Singapore, China and Russia together control
more than $2 trillion, a figure that could approach $12 trillion
by 2015, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
Such riches, coupled with the more-aggressive stance being taken
by ADIA and other sovereign funds, has raised concern that these
investors will wield their wealth for political as well as
financial reasons.
</P>
<P>
ADIA's secrecy is also drawing scrutiny. The fund has no internal
communications department, although it says it is in the process
of setting one up. When sovereign fund leaders from around the
world descended on Davos, Switzerland, in February for the World
Economic Forum, no one from ADIA saw fit to show up.
</P>
<P>
Executives at ADIA declined to comment for this article.
</P>
<P>
Last week Sen. Evan Bayh, D-Ind., the chairman of the Senate
subcommittee on security and international trade and finance, who
has raised concerns about sovereign fund transparency, traveled
to Abu Dhabi to meet with senior ADIA executives. Also last week,
a delegation led by Clay Lowery, a top Treasury official, met
with ADIA executives as part of a dialogue to formalize
investment guidelines for sovereign funds.
</P>
<P>
In many ways the tension between ADIA's elephantine size -- the
fund is twice as big as Norway's, the second-largest sovereign
fund -- and its demure aspect is underscored by its investment in
Citigroup.
</P>
<P>
Since ADIA's genesis in 1976, the fund has followed a
conservative investment approach. It has farmed out its assets to
foreign money managers and taken stakes in companies based upon
their weighting in benchmark stock indexes like the Standard
&amp;amp; Poor's 500. ADIA is also one of the largest
institutional investors in hedge funds and private-equity funds.
This approach has served ADIA well and reflects the strongly felt
notion that the fund's ultimate purpose is to serve as a
financial reserve for Abu Dhabi in times when oil revenues are
less robust.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, guided by the advice of a stream of foreign bankers
who worked at ADIA in the 1970s and 1980s, the fund has allocated
a large portion of its assets to equities. It now has about 65
percent of assets, or about $450 billion, invested in stocks,
according to bankers. Currently, the fund averages a yearly
return of 10 to 20 percent, say people who have been briefed on
the fund's investment strategy.
</P>
<P>
With oil about $100 a barrel, bankers and analysts estimate Abu
Dhabi produces a surplus of at least $50 billion a year. Given
the emirate's small population, 80 percent of which is foreign
born, even the most expansive investment and welfare policies
make it hard to put a dent in such a sum.
</P>
<P>
The United States is not a big buyer of Abu Dhabi's oil, most of
which goes to Asia, but the surplus is a vivid reminder of the
U.S. economy's own fiscal imbalance, to say nothing of its
diminishing global stature, a theme that underpins much of the
political worry surrounding sovereign fund investments.
</P>
<P>
"In the short run, that they are investing here is good," Bayh
said. "But in the long run it is unsustainable. Our power and
authority is eroding because of the amounts we are sending abroad
for energy and consumer goods."
</P>
<P>
In the past, much of Abu Dhabi's cash surplus has gone to ADIA,
although the formation two years ago of a smaller sister fund,
the Abu Dhabi Investment Council, has resulted in a lesser amount
flowing to ADIA, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
But ADIA's new strategic investment group represents the clearest
sign that the fund is taking steps to leverage its size and
influence. The division was set up in the summer of 2006 and is
overseen by Saeed Mubarek Rashid al-Hajiri, a young, Western-
educated portfolio manager who also heads the fund's considerable
investments in emerging-market economies.
</P>
<P>
In addition to Citigroup and Toll Brothers, in which AIDA took a
4.5 percent position last summer, other companies in the group's
portfolio include EFG Hermes, one of the leading investment banks
in the Arab world, and Banque de Tunisie et des Emirats, a
Tunisian bank.
</P>
<P>
Instead of passively tracking indexes, this unit actively picks
investments in hopes of generating market-beating returns. It is
a method of stock picking practiced by most hedge funds and asset
management companies, and the Citigroup investment, with its size
and attendant risk, is a good example of this approach.
</P>
<P>
Compared with the overall fund, the assets within this group are
small at about $30 billion, according to people who have been
briefed on ADIA's strategy. As with all its investments, ADIA
adopts a long-term, passive approach and does not seek board
seats. These people say that outsiders still manage 80 percent of
ADIA's assets, proof that the fund's commitment to making direct
investments is only in its early stages.
</P>
<P>
This hesitation partly reflects the lack of a strong individual
within the organization who has the combination of investment
experience, trust of the royal family and a bit of international
swagger to assume a larger public presence.
</P>
<P>
Sheik Khalifa bin Zayed al-Nahyan, the president of the United
Arab Emirates and the ruler of Abu Dhabi, while chairman of the
fund, has a cautious and reserved disposition and does not take
an active role in ADIA. When Citigroup's chairman, Robert E.
Rubin, traveled to Abu Dhabi last November, his courtesy call was
made to Sheik Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan, the crown prince of
Abu Dhabi and the point person for the United States-Abu Dhabi
relationship.
</P>
<P>
The fund's managing director is Sheik Ahmed bin Zayed al-Nahyan,
a half-brother of Sheik Khalifa who maintains a full-floor office
in ADIA's sleek 40-story headquarters. People familiar with ADIA
management, however, say the sheik, who has worked at ADIA for 10
years, delegates significant authority to Jean-Paul Villain, a
publicity-shy French money manager who directs investment
strategy and asset allocation.
</P>
<P>
Villain, the most senior foreign-born executive at the fund,
first joined ADIA in the early 1980s from the French bank
Paribas. While other expatriates have come and gone, Villain has
stayed, except for a brief period in the mid-1980s. More so than
the other foreigners, Villain, whose wife is Syrian-born, has
gained the royal family's trust.
</P>
<P>
One view is that ADIA's penchant for secrecy stems from its
experience during the scandal at the Bank of Credit &amp;amp;
Commerce International of the early 1990s, during which ADIA is
said to have lost hundreds of millions of dollars. The al-Nahyan
family became embroiled in regulatory investigations, although no
charges were ever brought against them. But people who worked at
ADIA from its earliest days in the late 1970s and 1980s say that
the fund's reticence dates to its formation.
</P>
<P>
Some see this as a reflection of Abu Dhabi's small size, insular
culture and geographical vulnerability, a sense that the less
that is known about the specifics of ADIA's hoard, the better.
</P>
<P>
"ADIA does not answer to a wide public at home," said David L.
Mack, a former United States ambassador to the United Arab
Emirates. "They are a small country in an area with some nasty
countries like Iran that can make trouble for them. They don't
like to advertise."
