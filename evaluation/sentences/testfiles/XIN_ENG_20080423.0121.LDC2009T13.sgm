U.S. to announce alleged DPRK-Syria nuclear cooperation "soon"
</HEADLINE>

WASHINGTON, April 23 (Xinhua)
</P>
<P>
The United States will "soon" announce what it knows about
possible nuclear cooperation between the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea and Syria, senior officials of the White House
and the Pentagon said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In a Pentagon news conference, U.S. Defense Secretary Robert
Gates declined to elaborate details about the DPRK's nuclear
cooperation with Syria, but in response to the question when the
public would be told about truth, he simply said "soon."
</P>
<P>
"I think Secretary Gates said it well. 'Soon' is a good, short
answer," White House spokeswoman Dana Perino told reporters at
her daily briefing.
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to be able to say much on it today. And I'm not
confirming anything at this briefing in regards to the
substance," Perino added, declining to give any reason for her
silence.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA)
would tell lawmakers that Israel hit a nuclear site, possibly a
reactor, allegedly being constructed with the DPRK help.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday that the DPRK was
helping Syria build a plutonium-producing nuclear reactor before
Israel bombed the site last September. The Bush administration is
set to tell Congress.
</P>
<P>
Neither Israel nor the United States has made public information
about the strike in Syria, though speculation has been widespread
that the targeted site was a nascent nuclear reactor.
