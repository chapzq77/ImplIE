FOR WOODS, IT ' S A FAMILIAR RESULT IN A FAMILIAR PLACE

LEMONT, Ill.
</P>
<P>
Three days and several hours after the BMW Championship began
with lackluster crowds and soggy weather, it finished with near
perfection. Cog Hill channeled its past, finding a summer
climate, typical Chicago galleries and a familiar champion.
</P>
<P>
Tiger Woods, a three-time winner of the Western Open here who
finished the previous two in second place, made few mistakes on
Sunday on his way to a two-stroke victory in the third FedEx Cup
playoff event. He shot a final-round 8-under-par 63, getting him
to 22-under for the tournament.
</P>
<P>
"Starting off the day, I thought 20-under-par was going to be the
number," Woods said. "But that had to be altered. I figured if I
got it to 21, I'd be assured of at least getting into a playoff."
</P>
<P>
On Cog Hill's Dubsdread course, a layout Woods has said he
enjoys, he won his 60th PGA Tour event, putting him two shy of
Arnold Palmer on the career list.
</P>
<P>
The Tour Championship next week in Atlanta will determine the
winner of the inaugural FedEx Cup and its $10 million prize.
Woods now leads the FedEx Cup race in points. Phil Mickelson, who
entered last week in first but skipped the BMW Championship, fell
to third.
</P>
<P>
Woods began Sunday one stroke behind the third-round co-leaders,
Steve Stricker and Aaron Baddeley. But by the time Stricker,
Baddeley and Woods were through the eighth hole, all three were
tied at 17-under. There were points when the three were tied at
18-under and 19-under.
</P>
<P>
"Normally, you don't have to make this many birdies," Woods said.
"But with conditions this soft, the guys are just going to tear
this place apart. I think the three of us just got wrapped up in
it. We were all making birdies, and we kept pushing each other."
</P>
<P>
Woods finished with four birdies on the front nine and four on
the back nine. Once he got to 20-under with a birdie at No. 13,
nobody could reach him.
</P>
<P>
"At that point, playing catch-up to Tiger is tough to do,"
Stricker said.
</P>
<P>
Stricker, the Madison, Wis., resident and an All-American at
Illinois, served as the week's underdog story with a local twist.
But he came up short on the back nine, finishing the tournament
in third place at 18-under after a fourth-round 68.
</P>
<P>
Stricker is in second place in the standings. He will begin the
Tour Championship in the same group as Woods, which also happened
last week.
</P>
<P>
"The first couple of rounds playing with Tiger was very rewarding
for me," Stricker said. "I learned a lot. I learned how to deal
with being in his group. I felt comfortable with that."
</P>
<P>
Baddeley, 26, quietly continued a strong season, shooting a
final-round 66 to reach 20-under 264, a figure that could have
won almost any other year at Cog Hill. But Woods finished with a
262, a record 72-hole total for the tournament.
</P>
<P>
"Steve and I sort of both made him do that, because we were both
playing well," Baddeley said. "And he just made a couple extra
birdies at the finish there to get by us."
</P>
<P>
After 17 straight years of having the Western Open and then BMW
Championship at Cog Hill, the tournament will move to Bellerive
Country Club in St. Louis next year. It was only appropriate that
Woods won this edition of the tournament, where he received an
exemption as an amateur and made his first Tour cut.
</P>
<P>
"I've always just loved playing here," Woods said.
