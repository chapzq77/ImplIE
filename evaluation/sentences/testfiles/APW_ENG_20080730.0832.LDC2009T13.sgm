BIRMINGHAM, England 2008-07-30 15:29:09 UTC
</P>
<P>
England struggled at 173-6 against South Africa at tea on the
opening day of the third test Wednesday, with captain Michael
Vaughan and Paul Collingwood again failing with the bat.
</P>
<P>
Andrew Flintoff (4) and Tim Ambrose (0) were the unbeaten batsmen
at the interval as the home side wilted against high quality fast
bowling.
</P>
<P>
Alastair Cook (76), Collingwood (4) and Ian Bell (50) were the
three wickets to fall after lunch.
</P>
<P>
Bell fell to Makhaya Ntini in the penultimate over before tea to
leave England reeling after winning the toss and electing to bat.
</P>
<P>
Resuming at 82-3 after lunch, Cook and Bell took their fourth-
wicket partnership to 62 before Cook edged his former Essex team
mate Andre Nel to Jacques Kallis at second slip.
</P>
<P>
Collingwood, recalled to the side after being dropped for the
second test, took 16 balls to get off the mark before edging
Kallis to Graeme Smith at slip.
</P>
<P>
Bell reached his 19th test 50 from 94 deliveries with a cover
drive, but was out just before tea when he edged behind to Mark
Boucher off Ntini.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, England had looked comfortable on 68-0 after winning the
toss and electing to bat.
</P>
<P>
But they lost Andrew Strauss (20) and Vaughan without scoring in
successive deliveries as Nel made an immediate impact in his
first test of the series.
</P>
<P>
Strauss made the mistake of moving too deep into his crease and
treading on his stumps while attempting to flick the ball away in
the 23rd over.
</P>
<P>
Nel, who replaced the injured Dale Steyn, then removed Vaughan
when he played forward and sent a catch behind to Boucher.
</P>
<P>
England lost Kevin Pietersen just before lunch, caught by Ashwell
Prince at backward point off the bowling of Kallis.
</P>
<P>
Television replays suggested that Pietersen had missed the ball
while trying to whip it through midwicket, but should have been
given out leg before wicket as it crashed into his pad.
</P>
<P>
South Africa captain Graeme Smith was passed fit, so Nel was the
visitors' only change.
</P>
<P>
England brought back Ryan Sidebottom and Collingwood to replace
Darren Pattinson and Stuart Broad.
</P>
<P>
England lost the second test at Headingley by 10 wickets and is
1-0 down in the four match series.
