NEW DELHI 2007-01-11 10:44:10 UTC
</P>
<P>
India's Infosys Technologies Ltd. said Thursday its net profit
jumped 52.4 percent in the most recent quarter from a year ago on
strong outsourcing orders.
</P>
<P>
The company, which writes and develops software for Western
companies like Goldman Sachs and J.C. Penney Co., said it added
43 new clients during the quarter.
</P>
<P>
"The globalization of services continues to be strong. We do not
see any reduction in global spending on IT (information
technology," said Infosys Chief Executive Nandan Nilekani.
</P>
<P>
Infosys' net profit for the October-December quarter rose to
US$218 million (euro168 million) from US$143 million in the same
period last year, in line with what analysts expected.
</P>
<P>
Revenue for the fiscal third quarter expanded 47 percent to
US$821 million (euro632 million) from US$559 million a year ago.
</P>
<P>
Nilekani said the company was negotiating several major deals,
but refused divulge the details. The company added 3,282 new
employees during the quarter, taking its total headcount to
69,432.
</P>
<P>
The company's forecasts for revenue and earnings per share
initially disappointed investors, who sent the stock down as much
as 2 percent. But it later recovered to close 0.8 percent higher
at 2,183 rupees on the Bombay Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
Infosys predicted sales for the fiscal year through March would
rise 44 percent to US$3.09 billion (euro2.38 billion). The
Nasdaq-listed company said earnings per share for the fiscal year
would rise 44 percent to US$1.47 (euro1.13).
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the company has done well in maintaining its profit
margins despite an appreciation of the Indian currency, which
erodes revenue when overseas earnings in dollars are converted to
rupees.
</P>
<P>
"The muted guidance is perhaps based on expectations of a further
strengthening of the rupee," said Divya Nagarajan, analyst at
Motilal Oswal Securities, a Mumbai-based brokerage firm.
</P>
<P>
The rupee appreciated about 2.5 percent during the October-
December quarter, said V. Balakrishnan, chief financial officer
of Infosys. The company's operating margin would have increased
at least 2 percent more in rupee terms if there was no
appreciation, he said.
</P>
<P>
Infosys CEO Nilekani said the company's billing rates -- which in
the past came under pressure because of competition -- have
become "stable with an upward bias."
</P>
<P>
He said the company was also encouraged by new opportunities in
China, where a lot of companies are keen to hire Infosys.
</P>
<P>
"Apart from the rupee, all the other factors are benign," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Among new clients, Infosys said it has been hired by a U.S.
grocery chain to enhance its information technology system
supporting warehouse operations. Another new client was a large
distributor of paper products in the United States. The clients
were not identified.
</P>
<P>
All the earnings figures released by the company conformed to
U.S. accounting standards.
