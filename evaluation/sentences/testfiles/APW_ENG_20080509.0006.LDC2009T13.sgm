Australia to resume cattle exports to Egypt under conditions to
prevent cruel treatment

<P>
Australia will resume live cattle exports to Egypt after a two-
year halt due to alleged cruel treatment of the animals.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture Minister Tony Burke told Fairfax newspapers that
resumption of exports will be subject to strict conditions,
including that the cattle are handled according to international
standards and slaughtered only at a new facility east of Cairo.
</P>
<P>
The report said the cattle trade between the countries was worth
730 million Australian dollars (US$690 million; euro450 million).
</P>
<P>
Animal rights groups have lobbied the Australian government for
several years to end live animal exports to the Middle East
because of concerns over the Islamic halal slaughter method,
which involves slitting the animal's jugular vein and draining
all the blood from the carcass.
