BEIJING, Sept. 17 (Xinhua)
</P>
<P>
The Beijing Paralympic Games not free of doping was a pity, said
the Internatianal Paralympic Committee (IPC) president Philip
Craven here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The IPC reported three doping cases, all from the sport of
powerlifting and another positive case under the national
Paralympic committee's control came to light during Games.
</P>
<P>
"The winter Games were free of it in Turino Games completely. So
we are not happy that there are still three positive tests. I
don't think that we are going away and laughing at this and
saying that was a pretty good Games in the doping point of view,"
said Craven.
</P>
<P>
"Those three tests are something that we don't want and we will
fight to catch the cheats if they keep on showing on the Games
even if it's only the three of them," he said.
</P>
<P>
Pakistani powerlifter Naveed Ahmed Butt became the first to fail
the doping test at the Games. Facourou Sissoko of Mali and
Liudmyla Osmanova of Ukraine, both powerlifting competitors, were
also expelled from the Paralympics after testing positive for
steroids.
</P>
<P>
Another doping case was from German wheelchair basketball player
Ahmet Coskun who was kicked out of the Games as traces of
finasteride were found in his urine sample taken on August 23 but
it was not an IPC test.
</P>
<P>
The German National Paralympic Committee announced the positive
result and withdrew the player from the Games.
</P>
<P>
Craven said all three doping cases from the Games were found out
in out-of- competition tests and the low number proved that the
program was effective in the fight against doping.
</P>
<P>
"Each of them is out of competition. To date, we haven't had one
in-competition doping case," he said. "We think that what have
been put in place here with great cooperation with BOCOG has
showed that the Paralympic Games are near enough free of doping."
</P>
<P>
About 1,100 tests both out-of-competition and in-competition
would be carried out among some 4,000 athletes during the Sept.
6-17 Games.
</P>
<P>
"We will work even harder on the education. We worked very hard
on the education of our sports for the last four years.  I think
we can say that we are having some success but we want more
success," Craven said.
