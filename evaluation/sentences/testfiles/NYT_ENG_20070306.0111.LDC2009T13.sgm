BUSH SETS REVIEW AS SENATORS GRILL MILITARY ON SOLDIER CARE

WASHINGTON - President Bush announced a bipartisan commission
Tuesday to review the care given wounded war veterans, while
senators called top Army officials to account for a medical
system that has put the soldiers into squalid housing and
bureaucratic limbo.
</P>
<P>
In the latest response to the unfolding scandal that began with
media reports of neglect in the outpatient services at Walter
Reed Medical Center in the nation's capital, the president told
an American Legion gathering that the treatment of the returning
troops was "unacceptable to our country."
</P>
<P>
"I am as concerned as you are about the conditions," Bush said.
"My decisions have put our kids in harm's way."
</P>
<P>
He appointed former Sen. Bob Dole, a Republican, and Donna
Shalala, a Democrat who served as secretary of health and human
services, to head the review panel.
</P>
<P>
The commission is charged with improving the delivery of health
care and benefits and easing the transition of wounded personnel
back into military service or into civilian life.
</P>
<P>
The president also ordered the Department of Veterans Affairs to
set up a task force to find gaps in services for "returning
global war on terror heroes."
</P>
<P>
At the same time, senior military leaders were on the
congressional hot seat for the second day in a row.
</P>
<P>
Members of the Senate Armed Services Committee asked a panel that
include the Army chief of staff how serious problems in the
medical system had escaped their attention.
</P>
<P>
Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., who chaired the hearing, promised a
bipartisan effort to fix the defects.
</P>
<P>
"How can we as a nation ask our young men and women to serve, and
when they're wounded ... put them in a position where they are
scared to death that we will not take proper care of them and
their families?" he asked.
</P>
<P>
Sen. John McCain of Arizona, and Sen. Saxby Chambliss of Georgia,
both Republicans, challenged Army officials to explain why they
failed to learn lessons from a similar scandal at Fort Stewart,
Ga., three years ago.
</P>
<P>
"This is not the first time this has happened," Chambliss said,
citing revelations of substandard housing and slow follow-up for
medical services for troops returning from Iraq in 2003.
</P>
<P>
Chambliss said the Army remedied the Fort Stewart shortfalls and
"assured us, and I quote, 'What we learned from this incident is
going to help the Army when we have other major units returning
from Operation Iraqi Freedom.' "
</P>
<P>
McCain said the Walter Reed conditions, made public in a series
of Washington Post articles quoting outpatients, were "even more
troubling because we had reason to believe" the Army had made
corrections after the Fort Stewart issues surfaced.
</P>
<P>
Gen. Peter Schoomaker, the Army chief of staff, said that
conditions have changed in the past few years as new waves of
troops return with multiple and more serious wounds as a result
of the improvised explosive devices set off by insurgents in
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"This is by far a more complex problem that we're facing here" at
Walter Reed, Schoomaker said.
</P>
<P>
As the top uniformed officer in the Army, "I stand before you
accountable for what has occurred," Schoomaker said. He outlined
steps the military was taking to improve medical services for
those who are wounded.
</P>
<P>
For example, the Army announced it would visit 11 bases to study
the care and information given to patients. They include Winn
Army Community Hospital at Fort Stewart; Eisenhower Army Medical
Center at Fort Gordon, Ga.; Darnall Army Community Hospital at
Fort Hood, Texas; Brooke Army Medical Center at Fort Sam Houston,
Texas, and Beaumont Army Medical Center at Fort Bliss, Texas.
</P>
<P>
Schoomaker also blamed a "bureaucratic morass" for the medical
care system's failures. "Life every day in this system is like
running in hip boots in a swamp," he said.
</P>
<P>
Lawmakers and military officials agreed that the military faces a
new set of conditions, starting with heroic battlefield medical
efforts that have saved many more wounded soldiers than in past
wars but have left them with life-altering injuries requiring
more services and counseling.
</P>
<P>
Some lawmakers, including Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton, D-N.Y.,
faulted recent efforts to privatize some of the services at
Walter Reed, where the changeover from federal employees to
contract workers left the support staff temporarily undermanned.
</P>
<P>
Several lawmakers have also questioned Congress' decision to
close Walter Reed and merge its services with those at the naval
hospital at Bethesda, Md.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
Some of the toughest questions Tuesday were aimed at Lt. Gen.
Kevin C. Kiley, the Army's surgeon general, whose home is across
the street from Walter Reed's now-infamous Building 18, a
barracks for recuperating soldiers that had moldy walls and an
infestation of rodents.
</P>
<P>
"I obviously didn't check enough on what was happening at Walter
Reed," said Kiley, who served as commander of the medical center
before moving to his current post.
</P>
<P>
Kiley tried to make amends for his remarks at a House hearing
Monday that it was not his job to inspect barracks. "It was not
my intent to shed responsibility," Kiley told the senators.
</P>
<P>
Freshman Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., read an e-mail from a
soldier at Walter Reed who had lost both legs and who said Kiley
should resign because he had known about serious problems within
the medical system and "swept them under the rug."
</P>
<P>
McCaskill accused Kiley of trying to "diminish the severity of
the problem" by using a survey taken last month indicating that
less than 3 percent of the outpatient soldiers had complaints
about the administrative process.
</P>
<P>
"You don't really believe that only 3 percent of the outpatients
had complaints, do you?" McCaskill asked.
</P>
<P>
"I think that was General (George) Weightman's testimony,
senator, not mine," Kiley replied, referring to the just-fired
commander of Walter Reed who testified Monday before a House
investigating committee.
</P>
<P>
The senator fired back: "This is your statement that you provided
to the committee today."
