Palestinian parliament poised to approve Hamas-Fatah coalition
government

GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip 2007-03-17 09:03:13 UTC

<P>
The new Hamas-Fatah coalition was to set to clear a final formal
hurdle Saturday, approval by the parliament, before taking on the
challenge of persuading a skeptical world to end a crippling
year-long boycott of the Palestinian government.
</P>
<P>
The government's program, finalized late Friday, contained some
softer language than a draft published earlier in the week,
though is still falls short of international demands for
acceptance, including explicit recognition of Israel and
renunciation of violence.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Ismail Haniyeh of Hamas was to present the
platform at the start of the parliament session, to be held
simultaneously in Gaza City and in Ramallah, with a video link.
Palestinian lawmakers cannot meet in one place because of Israeli
travel bans. Hundreds of protesters, including disgruntled
security men and farmers, held vigils at both sides to press for
jobs and government support.
</P>
<P>
According to the program, the coalition's main goal will be to
set up a Palestinian state in lands Israel occupied in the 1967
Mideast War, said incoming Information Minister Mustafa
Barghouti, an independent.
</P>
<P>
The government "respects" previous international agreements
reached by the PLO and calls for peace talks to be conducted by
moderate Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas of Fatah. Any future
deal could be submitted to a national referendum, suggesting that
the Islamic militant Hamas will not be given veto power.
</P>
<P>
The program calls for expanding a cease-fire with Israel, yet
also "affirms resistance in all its forms, expecially non-violent
resistance to occupation." The reference to resistance was part
of the draft, in an apparent nod to Hamas, while the phrase "non-
violent" was introduced later.
</P>
<P>
Barghouti said he expects the program to open doors for the new
government. `This program provides an opportunity for peace and
reconciliation. It should provide a powerful base for ending the
embargo on the Palestinian Authority," he said.
</P>
<P>
Later Saturday, Abbas is to swear in the coalition, formed after
months of stop-and-go negotiations interrupted by periods of
deadly factional fighting that claimed more than 140 lives.
Brushing aside international misgivings about Fatah joining
forces with Hamas, Abbas has said it's the only way to avert a
civil war in the West Bank and Gaza.
</P>
<P>
Israel announced earlier this week, reacting to the draft program
published on web sites, that it would not deal with the new
government. On Friday, Israel's deputy defense minister, Ephraim
Sneh, said Israel would "explain to the countries of the world
that they can't work with a government like that."
</P>
<P>
Israel's vice premier, Shimon Peres, said Saturday that the
international community should stand firm. "If this is a
government that does not renounce terror, if this is a government
that does not want to conduct peace talks, why should it be
helped?" he told Israel Radio.
</P>
<P>
Abbas aide Nabil Abu Rdeneh said the Palestinians were counting
on the good will of the international community. "Those who are
looking for a reason to boycott the government will find a
reason, but others who are looking for a way to work with the
government will also find it," he said.
</P>
<P>
Among the Quarter of Mideast mediators -- the U.S., the European
Union, the U.N. and Russia -- the most positve reaction to the
new coalition has come from Moscow.
</P>
<P>
"It is inarguably an important event in terms of consolidation of
the Palestinian ranks," Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman
Mikhail Kamynin said in a statement, noting that the Palestinian
power-sharing deal "took into account" the Quartet conditions.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. was more subdued. White House spokesman Tony Snow,
saying he did not want to express disappointment, indicated
Thursday that there would be no change in the U.S.
administration's refusal to deal with the Palestinian government
unless its platform changed.
</P>
<P>
"Our position has been consistent, which is, you need a
Palestinian government that is going to, in fact, abide by the
Quartet conditions," Snow said.
</P>
<P>
However, Barghouti said Saturday that the Palestinians have
received positive signs from Europe that the the boycott might be
eased.
