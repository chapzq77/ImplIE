Federal police said they launched a major operation Monday in
five Brazilian states to crack down on an international drug gang
that hid cocaine in fruit shipments.
</P>
<P>
One woman was arrested in Bahia state and authorities said they
were searching for an unknown number of people in the states of
Sao Paulo, Santa Catarina, Rio Grande do Sul and Ceara.
</P>
<P>
The Agencia Estado news service identified the suspect as Ana
Lucia de Araujo Lima, the manager of farms where mangoes, melons
and grapes were grown to smuggle the cocaine.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, five Colombians and two Brazilians who allegedly
belong to the ring were arrested in Uruguay with 480 kilograms
(1,060 pounds) of cocaine. Police said they were headed to the
Netherlands.

<P>
Among those detained was Gustavo Duran Bautista, whom Uruguayan
police said led the criminal organization. Bautista owns three
ranches in Brazil and abroad, as well as an import-export company
in Europe, authorities said.

<P>
Brazilian federal police said Monday's operation is part of a
four-year investigation involving police in Uruguay, the
Netherlands, Bolivia, England, France, Spain, Argentina and
Paraguay.
