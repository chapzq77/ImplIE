Trade talks hit 'very tense' stage: WTO spokesman
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Negotiators hit a "very tense" and uncertain stage in talks to
forge a global trade pact as key powers prepared to tackle a
crucial outstanding issue in a late meeting, a WTO spokesman said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"The situation is very tense, things are finely balanced and the
outcome is by no means certain," the spokesman, Keith Rockwell,
told reporters, adding that delegates were focussing on the
sticking point of import tariff changes.
</P>
<P>
"The issue for the past 12 hours has very largely been the SSM,"
he said, naming the "special safeguard mechanism" to protect poor
farmers from surges in imports, which has split India and the
United States at this week's talks.
</P>
<P>
Talks have dragged on for more than a week as ministers tried to
bridge their differences on subsidies and import tariffs to forge
a new trade deal under the World Trade Organization's Doha Round.
</P>
<P>
"There have been a variety of proposals, suggestions, formulas
that have been thrashed out by senior officials, ministers,
ambassadors, working to try and find a way forward on the issue,"
Rockwell said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the group of seven key trade powers -- Australia,
Brazil, China, the European Union, India, Japan and the United
States -- were about to begin meeting into the night early
Tuesday to try to clinch a deal.
