US predicts below average central Pacific hurricane season

Hawaii and the central Pacific Ocean face a slightly below
average hurricane season this summer with just two or three
tropical cyclones expected, the U.S. National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration predicted.
</P>
<P>
But officials warned residents Monday that a big storm could
still hit the islands.
</P>
<P>
With sea surface temperatures colder than average, scientists at
NOAA's Central Pacific Hurricane Center in Hawaii predicted
possible La Nina conditions resulting in less tropical cyclone
activity, which covers tropical depressions, tropical storms and
hurricanes over the central Pacific.
</P>
<P>
Those conditions and the overall reduction in hurricane activity
in that region since 1995 led to the cooled-down prediction for
the June-November season, said Jim Weyman, director of NOAA's
Central Pacific Hurricane Center, at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
But he warned against not being prepared.
</P>
<P>
"When I give a slightly below average forecast it always troubles
me because people always think they don't have to worry, and that
is not the message we want to take," Weyman said. "The message is
it only takes that one to cause tremendous devastation."
</P>
<P>
The islands get an average of 4.5 tropical cyclones a year and
one hurricane about every 15 years. Last year, the central
Pacific had five tropical cyclones after NOAA predicted two to
three.
</P>
<P>
The last hurricane to hit Hawaii was in 1992 when Iniki killed
six people and caused $2.5 billion in damage.
</P>
<P>
Weyman said the Central Pacific Hurricane Center will now use
Hawaiian names for tropical storms and hurricanes. The next one
will be called Kika, which means strong and energetic.
