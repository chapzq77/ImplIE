UAW, GM said to be close to reaching a deal after 20 straight
days of negotiations

Negotiators for General Motors Corp. and the United Auto Workers
were close to finalizing the details of a new contract after 20
straight days of talks, according to a local union official who
is being briefed on the discussions.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have wrapped up work on most issues and on Sunday
were down to determining how much money GM must put into a trust
fund for retiree health care that will be managed by the UAW,
said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity
because the talks are private.
</P>
<P>
"My sense is they are close. I think this is the end game," said
Harley Shaiken, a professor at the University of California at
Berkeley who specializes in labor issues and has been closely
following the talks. "They may be approaching a resolution, but
if that's in the next two hours or the next two days, it's hard
to say. There are a lot of complex issues yet to be resolved."
</P>
<P>
The health care fund -- known as a Voluntary Employees
Beneficiary Association, or VEBA -- would be a groundbreaking
change for the auto industry and has been the major issue in this
year's negotiations. GM has around $51 billion (euro36.3 billion)
in unfunded retiree health care costs, but the company is not
required to put the full amount into the VEBA. The UAW and GM
have been wrangling over how much GM should put in and how much
can be paid in cash or in stock.
</P>
<P>
Talks resumed Sunday morning after negotiators recessed Saturday
evening, GM spokesman Tom Wickham said. Sunday marked the ninth
day since GM's contract with the UAW had been scheduled to
expire. The contract has been renewed on an hour-by-hour basis
since then.
</P>
<P>
A message seeking comment was left for UAW spokesman Roger
Kerson.
</P>
<P>
Several local union officials said they had heard little about
the negotiations as of Sunday afternoon and had not been told
when the UAW will tell them about the deal. Once a tentative
agreement is reached, local union leaders will meet for a
briefing and then will present the deal to their members. Any
agreement will have to be ratified by a majority of GM's 73,000
UAW members.
</P>
<P>
Among the Detroit Three, the UAW picked GM as the lead company in
negotiations and the union's potential strike target, so Ford
Motor Co. and Chrysler LLC would likely match many of the terms
of GM's agreement.
</P>
<P>
GM, which has about 339,000 UAW retirees and spouses, badly wants
to pay the union to form the VEBA to get the health care
liabilities off its books. The UAW is seeking guarantees of new
vehicles to be built in U.S. plants in exchange.
</P>
<P>
Shaiken said workers will want to see job security promises if
they're being asked to accept a VEBA.
</P>
<P>
"There's a tendency in negotiations for observers to focus on one
or two contentious issues, but ultimately it's a package that's
being voted on," he said.
