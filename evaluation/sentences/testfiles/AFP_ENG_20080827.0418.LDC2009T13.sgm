Cricket: Injury forces Mushtaq retirement
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sussex's legendary former Pakistan international spinner Mushtaq
Ahmed confirmed Wednesday that he has been forced to retire
because of a persistent knee injury.Mushtaq won three county
championships, a C&amp;G Trophy and the Totesport Division Two
title with Sussex but after a season plagued by injury problems,
he has decided to call it a day.
</P>
<P>
The 38-year-old has been one of the driving forces behind the
county's success during his six years at Hove - taking 598
wickets in all competitions.
</P>
<P>
"I am going to miss playing for the club greatly," said Mushtaq,
who last competed for his country in 2003.
</P>
<P>
"I would firstly like to thank Allah for providing me with this
great family. This is a very hard decision for me to make, as I
feel that I could possibly play one more year, but out of
respect, I would only do that if I felt 100 percent and I
wouldn't want to risk that for the family.
</P>
<P>
"I am truly honoured to have spent six wonderful years here.
</P>
<P>
"My love, my feelings and my heart will always be with Sussex and
I will always pray to Allah for continued success at Sussex."
</P>
<P>
Club captain Chris Adams said: "Mushtaq's legacy at the club is
that he leaves us statistically, romantically and emotionally the
best player to ever pull on a Sussex shirt.
</P>
<P>
"In view of the impact he's made, it's difficult to think of
another cricketer who has achieved or done more for one county.
His legacy extends beyond the playing arena, as I'm sure all that
have been graced by his presence will agree. He is simply a great
man."
</P>
<P>
Mark Robinson, the county's cricket manager, added: "I don't
think that it will ever be possible to overplay the enormous
influence Mushtaq has had on Sussex in recent years.
</P>
<P>
"His record as a player and the trophies that he has helped us
win will speak for itself, but I would like to pay tribute to him
as a person from myself and all the people whose lives he has
touched for the enormous influence he has had on us."
