Battle at radical mosque in Pakistani capital leaves 9 dead

ISLAMABAD, Pakistan 2007-07-03 17:43:09 UTC
</P>
<P>
Street battles between Islamic radicals and security forces at a
fortress-like mosque in the Pakistani capital left at least nine
people dead Tuesday, adding to the country's sense of crisis.
</P>
<P>
Militant supporters of the mosque later pelted two government
buildings, including the Ministry of Environment, with rocks and
set them ablaze, and torched a dozen cars in the ministry's lot.
</P>
<P>
The violence dramatically deepened a six-month standoff at
Islamabad's Lal Masjid, or Red Mosque, whose hardline clerics
have challenged the government by kidnapping alleged prostitutes
and police in a Taliban-style anti-vice campaign.
</P>
<P>
At nightfall, the city's top security official, Khalid Pervez,
said a ceasefire had been reached with the armed militants.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Interior Minister Zafar Warriach said the dead included
four students, three civilians, one soldier and a journalist.
However, clerics at the mosque claimed that 10 of their
supporters died, according to a lawmaker sent to mediate.
</P>
<P>
Warriach said 148 were injured, most of them by tear gas fired by
security forces.
</P>
<P>
"The government is considering all options," the minister said
when asked what steps would be taken to defuse the stand-off. He
said no decision has been taken on imposing a national state of
emergency, but did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
Officials said the trouble started on Tuesday morning when police
moved to stop militant students from occupying a government
building.
</P>
<P>
Reporters saw dozens of students, including young men with guns
and women in black burqas, moving toward security forces deployed
about 200 meters (yards) from the red-walled, white domed mosque.
</P>
<P>
Police shot tear gas and several male students, some of them
masked, opened fire toward the security forces. Gunfire was also
heard from the police position.
</P>
<P>
Security forces, some riding in armored vehicles, cordoned off
the area with barbed wire and checkpoints, and sporadic gunfire
continued for several hours.
</P>
<P>
Men brandishing assault rifles, pistols and molotov cocktails,
some of them wearing gas-masks, were seen among about 200 people
marauding around the mosque, where lobbed tear-gas canisters
landed regularly.
</P>
<P>
At one point, a man used the mosque's loudspeakers to order
suicide bombers to get into position.
</P>
<P>
"They have attacked our mosque, the time for sacrifice has come,"
the man said.
</P>
<P>
However, no such attacks were reported.
</P>
<P>
Abdul Rashid Ghazi, the mosque's deputy leader, said the Rangers
sparked the trouble by erecting barricades near the mosque.
</P>
<P>
"The government is to be blamed for it," he said.
</P>
<P>
When asked about the presence of armed students at his mosque,
Ghazi said they "are our guards."
</P>
<P>
Shah Abdul Aziz, a lawmaker for a hard-line religious party who
rushed to the mosque to mediate said the mosque's leaders claimed
that 10 of their supporters had died, including two female
students.
</P>
<P>
"This matter can be resolved through dialogue. Force is not the
solution," Aziz said.
</P>
<P>
Police and witnesses said more than 2,000 students from an
Islamic school in the eastern city of Lahore rallied Tuesday,
chanting slogans against Pakistani President Gen. Pervez
Musharraf.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the protesters, Mufti Hamidullah Jan, a cleric at the
Jamia Ashrafia madrassa, vowed to send his students to Islamabad
if the government did not stop its action at the Red Mosque. "Now
is not the time for protests, but jihad (holy war)," he said.
</P>
<P>
The students shouted "yes" when Jan asked them if they were ready
for holy war.
</P>
<P>
Also Tuesday, about 200 supporters of a radical religious party
in the southwestern city of Quetta burned tires to protest the
police action against the Islamabad mosque and chanted slogans
against Musharraf and U.S. President George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
"Anyone who is a friend of America, is a traitor," many of the
protesters chanted.
</P>
<P>
Authorities have been at loggerheads with the mosque for months
over a land dispute and after its followers began a campaign to
impose a harsh version of Islamic law in the capital.
</P>
<P>
Senior officials, including the head of the ruling Pakistan
Muslim League-Q party, have tried to negotiate a settlement of
their grievances.
</P>
<P>
However, the clerics have steadily raised the stakes, staging
kidnappings of police officers and alleged prostitutes, including
several Chinese nationals, and repeatedly threatening suicide
attacks if security forces intervene.
</P>
<P>
Some accuse intelligence agencies of encouraging the crisis to
justify a state of emergency and prolong military rule -- a
conspiracy theory with considerable traction in Pakistan's
intrigue-ridden politics.
</P>
<P>
Plans for the general, a close U.S. ally who seized power in a
1999 coup, to ask lawmakers for a new five-year term this fall
are in doubt because of a political row over his attempt to fire
the country's top judge.
</P>
<P>
However, Musharraf's failure to crack down on the clerics'
spreading fear in the capital has dented his credentials as a
bulwark against extremism -- diminishing his worth to Washington,
his key international backer.
</P>
<P>
Musharraf said last week that he was ready to raid the mosque,
but warned that militants linked to al-Qaida had slipped inside
and that the media would blame any bloodbath on the government.
