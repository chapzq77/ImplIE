YouTube is urging US voters to shoot video at the polls during
the November 4 presidential election and upload it to a new
channel on the popular video- sharing site called "Video Your
Vote."
</P>
<P>
"Shoot a video of your experience at the polls on Election Day.
Document the energy and excitement, as well as any problems you
may see," YouTube said in a message Wednesday on the website of
the new channel, youtube.com/videoyourvote.

YouTube said the initiative, a partnership with the Public
Broadcasting Service (PBS), was aimed at educating voters while
"enabling the world to watch pivotal moments in this historic
election as they unfold."
</P>
<P>
"This program aims to gather massive amounts of polling place
video, with the Channel serving as an online library for Election
Day footage," YouTube, a Google subsidiary, said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"On November 4, the Channel will serve as the premier online
destination for up- to-the-minute coverage from voters
contributing videos straight from thousands of precincts across
the country," it said.
</P>

YouTube cautioned, however, that recording video was not allowed
at all polling places in the United States.
</P>
<P>
"Some states and counties have regulations against the use of
recording equipment at polling places on Election Day," it said,
urged voters to check their local rules before pulling out the
video camera or camera phone.
