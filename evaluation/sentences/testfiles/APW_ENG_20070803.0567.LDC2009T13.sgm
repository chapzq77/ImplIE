hospital

A man who was critically burned when a Jeep he was in crashed
into Glasgow Airport and burst into flames has died after more
than a month in hospital, ending police hopes he might be
questioned or charged over failed car bomb attacks there and in
London.
</P>
<P>
Kafeel Ahmed, 27, died Thursday at Glasgow Royal Infirmary,
police said. He had been in critical condition since a Jeep
Cherokee plowed into the passenger terminal at Scotland's busiest
airport on June 30. The incident came a day after two Mercedes
cars packed with gas canisters were discovered in central London.
</P>
<P>
"We can confirm that the man seriously injured during the course
of the incident at Glasgow Airport on Saturday June 30 has died
in Glasgow Royal Infirmary," said a spokesman for Strathclyde
Police, speaking on condition of anonymity in line with force
policy.
</P>
<P>
Witnesses saw Ahmed, an Indian engineer, set himself ablaze and
struggled with police and passers-by who tried to put out the
flames. He reportedly suffered burns to 90 percent of his body.
</P>
<P>
Ahmed spent five weeks in a hospital, unconscious and under armed
guard. He was a key suspect who police believed was at the center
of the bomb plot, but he was never officially arrested or
charged.
</P>
<P>
A member of Ahmed's medical team said the suspect was in a coma
during his entire time in hospital and he did not think police
had been able to interview him.
</P>
<P>
"This was one of the worst cases of burns I have ever seen. It
was very traumatic for everyone involved in his care," said the
doctor, who spoke on condition of anonymity because patient
details are not to be made public. "I was surprised he survived
this long."
</P>
<P>
The other man in the car, Iraqi doctor Bilal Abdullah, has been
charged with conspiring to set off explosions "of a nature likely
to endanger life or cause serious injury."
</P>
<P>
Three other people have been charged over the attacks, which
prompted the government to raise Britain's threat status from
"severe" to "critical," the highest level. It was reduced to
severe about a week later.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian doctor Mohammed Jamil Asha, arrested in his car on a
highway in central England, is charged with conspiring to cause
explosions. Kafeel Ahmed's brother, Sabeel Ahmed, 26, is charged
with withholding information that could prevent an act of
terrorism. He was arrested in Liverpool, England, on the day of
the Glasgow attack.
</P>
<P>
Mohamed Haneef, a 27-year-old cousin of the Ahmed brothers, was
arrested and charged in Australia over the attacks. He was
released after police were forced to admit they did not have
enough evidence to hold him.
</P>
<P>
Four other people were detained after the attacks, but later
released without charge. Apart from Kafeel Ahmed, all were
doctors or had worked for Britain's National Health Service.
</P>
<P>
The same health service was criticized by some Britons for giving
intensive and expensive medical care to a suspected terrorist.
</P>
<P>
Scotland's government, the Scottish Executive, defended Ahmed's
treatment.
</P>
<P>
"It was perfectly right that he should have received the
appropriate treatment our health service could offer as this
reflects the value our society places on human life," a spokesman
said on the government's customary condition of anonymity.
