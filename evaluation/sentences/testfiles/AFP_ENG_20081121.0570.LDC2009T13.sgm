US attorney general is alive after taking ill: Justice Department
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
US Attorney General Michael Mukasey is alive, the Justice
Department told AFP late Thursday, an hour after US media
reported he collapsed while delivering a speech in Washington and
lost consciousness.
</P>
<P>
"Yes he is" alive, a department spokeswoman said when asked if
Mukasey was still breathing, but she declined to discuss his
condition or provide any details surrounding the incident,
pending the release of an official statement.
</P>
<P>
Paramedics rushed Mukasey, 67, for treatment to the George
Washington University Medical Center after his speech became
slurred and he then became rigid while giving an address to a
Federalist Society dinner at a hotel in the capital, CNN reported
on its website.
</P>
<P>
Mukasey became attorney general in September 2007, when President
George W. Bush appointed him to replace the scandal-plagued
Alberto Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the appointment he had carved out a no-nonsense
reputation during his 18 years as a federal judge in New York,
and oversaw several high-profile cases including the 1993 trial
of Omar Abdel-Rahman, the "Blind Sheikh" who was sentenced to
life in jail for plotting to blow up New York landmarks.
