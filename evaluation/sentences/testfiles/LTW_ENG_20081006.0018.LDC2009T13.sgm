Taiwanese Leader Hails Weapons Deal With U.S.
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwanese President Ma Ying-jeou on Saturday welcomed U.S. plans
to sell the island almost $6.5 billion in weaponry, a move that
appeared to repair years of frayed ties between Taiwan and the
administration.
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon's Defense Security Cooperation Agency said in a
statement released Friday that it had notified Congress about the
sale, which marks Taiwan's first purchase of the Patriot Advanced
Capability-3 surface-to-air guided missile defense system.
</P>
<P>
"We think this announcement from the U.S. government is a sign
that the past eight years of discord are over," Ma said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
The sale serves as a reminder that the Taiwan Strait remains one
of Asia's potential flash points. China regards Taiwan as a
renegade province with no right to a sovereign government and has
threatened to invade in response to any moves toward
independence. The United States, under the 1979 Taiwan Relations
Act, has pledged to help Taiwan defend itself against any
unprovoked Chinese attack.
</P>
<P>
The weapons sale, which also includes Apache helicopters and
Harpoon missiles, comes as Taiwanese negotiators are working
behind the scenes with China to arrange a visit by Chen Yunlin,
the head of China's semiofficial agency negotiating with Taiwan,
at the end of the month or in November.
</P>
<P>
Chen would be the highest-ranking Chinese official to visit
Taiwan since the Nationalists relocated to the island in 1949.
</P>
<P>
Ma, who was elected in March on a platform of detente with China,
said Saturday that he still wants to develop cross-strait ties,
and analysts said the sale was unlikely to derail Chen's visit.
</P>
<P>
George Tsai, a political scientist at Taipei's Chinese Culture
University, said, "I think they understand the realities. I don't
think this will upset Chen Yunlin's visit."
</P>
<P>
The package was proposed by the U.S. government in 2001. But
lawmakers from Ma's Nationalist Party, who were in the opposition
at the time, refused to approve procurement budgets for several
years, saying the purchase was too costly.
</P>
<P>
After Taiwan finally approved the funding, senior U.S. officials
placed a de facto freeze on arms sales to Taiwan for almost a
year, observers said, because they were irritated by the
wrangling and because they needed China's help in resolving
international issues, such as persuading North Korea to
relinquish nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
Since coming to power, Nationalist officials, including Ma, have
worked at improving relations with the United States.
</P>
<P>
A Taiwanese defense official, speaking on the condition of
anonymity, said Taiwan would continue to lobby for two items
omitted from the package: 60 Black Hawk utility helicopters and a
feasibility study to build diesel-electric submarines. Taiwan
will also push the United States to sell it about 60 F-16 C/D
fighters, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Andrew Yang, a military analyst with the Chinese Council of
Advanced Policy Studies, said the sale, which the U.S. Congress
must approve, was largely symbolic, because China has more than
1,000 missiles pointed at the island, and Taiwan's defensive
capabilities remain limited.
