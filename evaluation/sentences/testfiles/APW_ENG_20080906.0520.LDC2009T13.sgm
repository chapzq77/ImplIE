Sens. John McCain and Barack Obama are putting aside partisan
politics for a joint appearance at ground zero to mark the
seventh anniversary of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.
</P>
<P>
The Democratic and Republican presidential nominees, in a joint
statement released Saturday, say they will appear together at the
World Trade Center site on Thursday "to honor the memory of each
and every American who died" in the 2001 attacks.
</P>
<P>
The campaigns already had agreed to suspend television
advertising critical of each other on Sept. 11. The McCain
campaign has said it will air no ads that day.
