Lawmakers ask court to stop oil search study by China, Vietnam
and Philippines

Left-wing legislators asked the Philippine Supreme Court on
Wednesday to order an immediate halt to a scientific study by the
state oil companies of China, Vietnam and the Philippines in the
disputed Spratly islands.
</P>
<P>
President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo and three of her Cabinet
members committed "treachery of the highest order" and a
"betrayal of paramount proportions" by allowing the three-year
seismic study, the six legislators said in a joint petition.
</P>
<P>
Given the extent of the study, which allegedly encompasses
disputed Spratly waters in the South China Sea and Philippine
territorial waters, "the state compromises and bargains away its
national economy and patrimony, national sovereignty," they said.
</P>
<P>
"It's a sellout," said Rep. Satur Ocampo, one of the petitioners.
</P>
<P>
He said the agreement to undertake the study could weaken the
Philippines' claim to the Spratlys archipelago, which includes
rich fishing grounds, straddles the world's busiest shipping
lanes and is believed to sit atop vast deposits of oil and gas.
Aside from China, the Philippines and Vietnam, Brunei, Malaysia
and Taiwan also claim all or parts of the remote islands.
</P>
<P>
The petitioners claim the Joint Marine Seismic Undertaking
violates the Philippine Constitution, which allows only the
Manila government to explore and exploit natural resources within
its territory. The government also can undertake explorations
with companies that are at least 60 percent owned by Filipinos,
they said.
</P>
<P>
The seismic study, part of oil exploration, is being undertaken
by Philippine National Oil Co., China National Offshore Oil Corp.
and Vietnam Oil and Gas Corp. The three governments have not said
whether any sign of oil or gas has been found in the sprawling
area. The study is to end next month.
</P>
<P>
The lawmakers belatedly acted to stop the joint study because it
only caught the public's attention in recent months.
</P>
<P>
Opposition lawmakers claim Arroyo's government agreed to the
study in exchange for huge Chinese loans for allegedly overpriced
projects that witnesses have told the Senate involved kickbacks
to officials.
</P>
<P>
The government, while denying any irregularities, has refused to
make the agreement public. Arroyo's aides have said the study is
part of efforts by Spratlys claimants to harness the region's
potential resources through peaceful joint undertakings.
</P>
<P>
The archipelago is regarded a potential flashpoint for conflict
in Asia. The battle for ownership of the region has settled into
an uneasy standoff since the last fighting, involving China and
Vietnam, killed more than 70 Vietnamese sailors in 1988.
