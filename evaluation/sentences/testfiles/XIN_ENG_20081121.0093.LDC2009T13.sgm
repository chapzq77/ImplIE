Roundup: Kenya urges Africa to seek homegrown development agenda

NAIROBI Nov. 21 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government has urged
Africans to defined their destiny and steer their homegrown
development agenda by using local resources rather than relying
on funding from foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan Prime Minister Raila Odinga said the widespread notion
that tangible development Africa could only be realized through
funding from Western countries and the Bretton Woods Institutions
was misplaced, adding that it was time the continent sought an
alternative source of capital from local resources.
</P>
<P>
"We have two categories of people in this continent, those who
are Afro-optimist and think that nothing is impossible to achieve
and others who are Afro- pessimists who perceive to the
contrary," he said on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
Odinga cited a recent case earlier in the year in which the World
Bank suspended the funding of major road projects in the country
on learning that a former Finance Minister had resigned from the
government to pave way for investigations.
</P>
<P>
He regretted that the continent was endowed with untapped
resources but was unfortunately the poorest one and only
attracted negative publicity from the international media.
</P>
<P>
Odinga told the launch of a local monthly magazine The African
Mirror that the foreign press had developed a culture of painting
the continent in bad light, hence to correct the anomaly.
</P>
<P>
He decried that the international press had influenced the
perception of policy- makers and influence decision-making
process in western nations who take advantage of any slight
negative publicity to withhold assistance to the continent.
</P>
<P>
"The perception of policy makers and of the general public in
those countries is rightfully reflected in their national
decisions," he said.
</P>
<P>
Odinga said Africans had the ability to shape their future and
challenged Kenyans to fight the ethnic fault lines that polarized
the nation and forge a united front towards the development of
the nation.
