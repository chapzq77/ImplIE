Australian cyclist Robbie McEwen pulled off a strategic maneuver
to win the opening stage of the weeklong Tirreno-Adriatico race
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
As the group was preparing for a mass sprint, McEwen tucked in
behind Lotto teammate Fred Rodriguez, who was leading the group.
Just as the racers were approaching the last two turns on the
course, with 400 meters (yards) to go, McEwen broke away.
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez stopped pedaling when McEwen passed him and slowed down
the opponents behind him. The rest of the pack couldn't close the
gap around the turns and, by the time the road straightened out,
McEwen had built a 50-meter (yard) lead and cruised across the
finish line.
</P>
<P>
McEwen won the 175-kilometer (109-mile) stage, which began and
ended in Civitavecchia, in 4 hours, 38 minutes, 24 seconds.
</P>
<P>
Three-time world champion Oscar Freire of Spain finished second,
two seconds behind, and Thor Hushovd of Norway was third with the
same time.
</P>
<P>
Top sprinters such as Alessandro Petacchi, Paolo Bettini and
Filippo Pozzato all finished in the main group.
</P>
<P>
The Tirreno-Adriatico is a traditional warmup for the Milan-San
Remo classic, which is scheduled for March 24.
</P>
<P>
The race marks the first in Italy for Giro d'Italia champion Ivan
Basso since he was barred from last year's Tour de France after
being implicated in a Spanish doping probe, known as Operation
Puerto. He was cleared in October by the Italian Olympic
Committee and the Italian cycling federation.
</P>
<P>
Alexandre Vinokourov, who is expected to challenge Basso in this
year's Tour de France, is also entered, along with defending
champion Thomas Dekker and Tyler Hamilton, the American who is
returning this season from a two-year doping ban.
</P>
<P>
Two riders fell and withdrew during the stage: Vladimir Efimkin
of Russia and Nicolas Roche of Ireland.
</P>
<P>
There are seven stages in the race, including a 20.5-kilometer
(12.7-mile) time trial on Sunday. The race ends Tuesday in San
Benedetto del Tronto.
