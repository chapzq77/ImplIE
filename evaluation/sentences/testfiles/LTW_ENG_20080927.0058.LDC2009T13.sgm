Venezuela, Russia Extend Ties in Chavez Visit to Moscow

<P>
Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez was feted here Friday with what
are emerging as the trademark tokens of Russian favor: oil and
gas deals, the promise of nuclear cooperation and, most
significant, a $1-billion loan to buy weapons.
</P>
<P>
Moscow agreed to lend Venezuela money to buy a wide range of
Russian weaponry and hardware, said a source in the Kremlin who
spoke on condition of anonymity. Reminiscent of Soviet loans to
anti-American Cold War allies, the deal is one of a number
gradually binding the two oil-rich, anti-Western governments into
tight cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Russia has gone out of its way to show off its burgeoning
friendship with the Latin American leader. Analysts suggest that
Moscow prizes Venezuela almost solely for its proximity to, and
hostility toward, the United States.
</P>
<P>
Russia has been enraged by U.S. support for NATO membership for
former Soviet states such as Ukraine and Georgia, and well as
U.S. plans to build anti-missile facilities in nearby Poland and
the Czech Republic. If the United States pressures Moscow in the
former Soviet bloc, the Russian elite has long believed, then why
shouldn't Russia exert its influence closer to American borders?
</P>
<P>
"Latin America is becoming a noticeable link in the whole chain
of the emerging multipolar world," Prime Minister Vladimir V.
Putin said during meetings with Chavez. "This is obvious, and we
will pay more and more attention to this area."
</P>
<P>
Russia sent a pair of strategic bombers to Venezuela earlier this
month for training exercises.
</P>
<P>
"Russian soldiers, officers and generals made the best impression
on our people," Chavez enthused during his meeting with Russian
President Dmitry Medvedev, according to Interfax. "We were filled
with admiration."
</P>
<P>
In late November, Russia is expected to dispatch warships,
including a nuclear-powered cruiser, into Venezuela's waters for
exercises. Some analysts have dismissed Russia's interest in
Venezuela as little more than an effort to battle a perception of
international isolation.
</P>
<P>
"This reflects a desperate search for partners and a desperate
search for allies that can create the impression that Russia
occupies some kind of political galaxy," said Lilia Shevtsova, a
senior associate at the Carnegie Moscow Center. "Unfortunately,
it's not only Chavez but Belarus, Hamas and Hezbollah. It's not
very civilized company."
</P>
<P>
Russia's crushing military intervention in Georgia this summer
roundly was criticized by the West as disproportionate. And even
nations that seemed neutral toward or supportive of Russia's
actions have balked at joining Moscow in recognizing the
independence of Georgia's two separatist republics, South Ossetia
and Abkhazia.
</P>
<P>
Chavez, too, carefully avoided recognizing the rebel regions. "We
know well what caused the conflict, who attacked the South
Ossetians and how," he said. "We once again express our complete
and firm support for your actions."
</P>
<P>
In recent years, his country has ordered more than $3 billion of
Russian weapons and military hardware, including helicopters,
missile defense systems and dozens of fighter jets. Russia has
also sold Venezuela some 100,000 Kalashnikov rifles and started
work on two local plants to manufacture the guns in Venezuela,
Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
During Friday's meetings, Putin also said that Russia was ready
to cooperate with Venezuela on nuclear energy. Meanwhile, the
Venezuelan and Russian energy ministries signed a memorandum of
understanding that sets out plans for a consortium among their
major oil and gas companies. The deal would give Russian
companies greater access to Venezuelan fields. Venezuela would
reap billions of dollars in Russian investments.
</P>
<P>
"We are, luckily, ahead of the world financial crisis," Chavez
said. "It will not get us."
