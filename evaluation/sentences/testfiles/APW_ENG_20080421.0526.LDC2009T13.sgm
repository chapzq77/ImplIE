Report: Election vote recount may take all week

HARARE, Zimbabwe 2008-04-21 12:22:22 UTC

<P>
The recounting of 23 contested parliamentary seats from last
month's election is "fatally flawed," a South African observer
said Monday as state media reported that the process might drag
on all week.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwe Electoral Commission said it needs longer than the
three days originally envisaged for the partial recount because
there is "a lot of work involved," according to the Herald
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The recount could prove pivotal for President Robert Mugabe's
ruling ZANU-PF party, which lost control of parliament in the
March 29 elections for the first time in 28 years, and needs just
nine seats to reclaim a majority.
</P>
<P>
The opposition has denounced the recount as illegal and has
alleged fraud. An observer also said ballot boxes were tampered
with. Dianne Kohler-Barnard, a lawmaker with South Africa's
opposition Democratic Alliance, called the entire recounting
process "futile" Monday.
</P>
<P>
"From what I have seen and experienced in Zimbabwe over the last
three days, it is clear that the process of recounting the
contested wards from the recent elections is fatally flawed," she
said.
</P>
<P>
"Of particular concern was the evidence of ballot box tampering
that I witnessed personally, which points to a concerted effort
to rig the election results in order to bring about a Mugabe
'victory,'" she said in a statement issued by her office in South
Africa.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe's opposition Movement for Democratic Change defeated
ZANU-PF in the first count of the parliamentary vote. But
electoral officials began recounting ballots Saturday for 23
contested legislative seats, most won by opposition candidates,
including in Mugabe's home district of Zvimba.
</P>
<P>
Results of the presidential election, also held March 29, still
have not been announced. Opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai
claims he won an outright victory, but independent observers say
it is more likely that he would face a runoff election against 84
-year-old Mugabe.
</P>
<P>
MDC Secretary-General Tendai Biti said Sunday that there were
clear signs of irregularities in the recount.
</P>
<P>
The opposition also claimed mounting violence and intimidation
against people who voted for their candidates, especially in
rural areas that once were Mugabe strongholds.
</P>
<P>
Violence had displaced 3,000 people, injured 500 and left 10
dead, Biti said at a news conference in South Africa. It was
impossible to verify the claims because of reporting restrictions
in Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
Biti said key members of the opposition's administration had been
arrested, along with more than 400 supporters. Biti and
Tsvangirai -- who has been accused of treason -- say they cannot
return to Zimbabwe because they would face immediate arrest.
</P>
<P>
Elections officials said the recount was going smoothly.
</P>
<P>
But "there are signs that the counting might take longer than the
three days we had projected," the Herald quoted Utloile
Silaigwana, a deputy chief elections officer, as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said the delay was mainly due to party agents "raising issues
which they would want attended to and clarified."
</P>
<P>
The Herald said in some constituencies, counting was proceeding
at a "snail's pace" and was likely to take about one week to
complete.
</P>
<P>
Kohler-Barnard said the process was marred by delays and
administrative problems.
</P>
<P>
"The repeated miscommunication of venue addresses meant that
party agents and electoral observers were frequently posted to
the incorrect venue, thus undermining the observation process and
contributing to further delays in the recount," she said.
</P>
<P>
She went on to list specific instances of ballot box
irregularities.
</P>
<P>
International pressure on Mugabe to release the election results
continued to mount.
</P>
<P>
The government of neighboring Malawi called for Zimbabwe's
government to resume talks with former colonizer Britain, white
farmers and the opposition party -- all of whom Mugabe considers
his enemies. The statement, dated Sunday, indicated growing
differences among southern African leaders on how to help resolve
Zimbabwe's crisis.
</P>
<P>
"The Government of Malawi believes that the people of Zimbabwe
should not live in the past. They must move on. Therefore, we
believe that a new set of negotiations could be initiated at
different levels ... so that Zimbabwe can begin to develop and
transform its economy," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe's economy, with inflation raging beyond 100,500 percent,
began unraveling when Mugabe ordered takeovers in the late 1990s
of large, fertile farms owned by a few thousand minority whites.
</P>
<P>
Britain initially had paid to buy some of the farms but stopped,
saying Mugabe was giving the land to cronies and relatives
instead of landless blacks Zimbabweans. New negotiations for
British support for land reform ended in 1997 when Britain's
Labour Party won power from the Conservatives and said it had no
responsibility for whites who own farms in Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said he was discussing the
crisis with African leaders on the sidelines of a five-day U.N.
trade meeting that opened Sunday in Ghana.
</P>
<P>
Tsvangirai, who is trying to muster more diplomatic support in
Africa, was due to travel to Nigeria and then Ghana and hoped to
meet Ban.
