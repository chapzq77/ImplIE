Saying he has "lived a blessed time," Sen. Edward Kennedy smiled
broadly and flashed a thumbs up as he accepted an honorary degree
from his alma mater during a rare special convocation at Harvard
University.
</P>
<P>
The 76-year-old senator walked onstage Monday to a standing
ovation and leaned lightly on a cane. He made no mention of his
battle with cancer but sounded a reflective note toward the end
of his eight-minute address.
</P>
<P>
"We know the future will outlast all of us, but I believe that
all of us will live on in the future we make," Kennedy said. "I
have lived a blessed time. Now, with you, I look forward to a new
time of aspiration and high achievement for our nation and the
world."
</P>
<P>
In being honored at a special convocation, Kennedy joins a select
group that includes George Washington, Winston Churchill and
Nelson Mandela.
</P>
<P>
Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer, a former Kennedy staffer,
spoke at the ceremony, and Vice President-elect Joe Biden was
among those in attendance. The event had been scheduled for last
spring but was postponed as the senator recovered from surgery to
treat a malignant brain tumor.
</P>
<P>
Kennedy devoted nearly a third of his speech to the election of
Barack Obama, describing the election of the first African-
American head of state as a giant step forward in U.S. history,
and one that marks a new beginning for the country.
</P>
<P>
He said he was "proud to have played a small part" in the
historic election. Kennedy gave Obama a key endorsement during
his hard-fought Democratic primary against Sen. Hillary Rodham
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
"There is no other time when I would rather receive this honor
than this year -- at this turning point in American history," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Kennedy also defended his reputation as the "liberal lion" of the
Senate, where he has served for 46 years.
</P>
<P>
He quoted his brother, former President John F. Kennedy, saying:
"If by a liberal, they mean someone who looks ahead and not
behind ... someone who cares about the welfare of the people --
their health, their housing, their schools, their jobs, their
civil rights ... then I am proud to say I am a liberal."
</P>
<P>
Kennedy graduated from Harvard in 1956 and was elected to the
Senate six years later to fill the seat held by his brother
before he was elected president.
</P>
<P>
Breyer, a former assistant professor at the Harvard Law School,
introduced himself not as a member of the Supreme Court, but as a
"former member of the Kennedy staff" who cut his political teeth
working in the senator's office.
</P>
<P>
He said he learned key lessons from Kennedy, including how to
work across political divides.
</P>
<P>
"He'd say be generous with the credit," Breyer said, "If you're
successful there'll be plenty of credit to go around, and if
you're not successful, who wants credit for that?"
</P>
<P>
Breyer ticked off a list of some of Kennedy's legislative
successes, including his push to foster neighborhood health
centers and to expand health care for children and the mentally
ill.
</P>
<P>
During his comments, Kennedy recalled his love of sailing in the
waters off Cape Cod, a metaphor for what he said was the next
great adventure in the nation's history.
</P>
<P>
"I have believed that America must sail toward the shores of
liberty and justice," Kennedy said. "There is no end to that
journey, only the next great voyage."
