Commentary: New Hampshire melted my cold Floridian heart
</P>
<P>
It is wicked cold here in Dover, N.H., and the residents are pale
and lumpy in their New England Patriots jackets, and the
roadsides are festooned with campaign signs planted in the sooty
snow banks like flags in Mount Everest, and in so many ways it is
so much different than the rest of America.
</P>
<P>
If New Hampshire were applying for the job of vetting candidates
for president of these United States, one might suggest that New
Hampshire look elsewhere for work, like at one of the
approximately 1,443,713 Dunkin' Donuts that cover the state, the
way corn covers Iowa.
</P>
<P>
As a political reporter for Florida's largest newspaper, my sense
has long been that New Hampshire played an outsized role in
choosing the nation's presidential candidates.
</P>
<P>
It has only 1.3-million residents, far fewer than live in the
Tampa Bay area. More than 95 percent of them are white. You can
drive from one end of New Hampshire to the other and back in less
time than it takes to get from St. Petersburg to Miami, and
that's taking the long way.
</P>
<P>
It is dangerously close to Canada, a foreign country full of
foreigners who, if they were to sneak across the border, would be
illegal immigrants.
</P>
<P>
So what makes the Granite State so great, so prescient, that it
should tell everyone else in the country who should be president?
Wondering that very same thing, the Florida Legislature last year
moved the Sunshine State's Democratic and Republican primary
elections to Jan. 29, figuring a large, diverse and politically
important state deserved a bigger role in choosing the next
presidential candidates.
</P>
<P>
New Hampshire and the other early primary and caucus states Iowa,
Nevada and South Carolina  were not amused. Vetting presidents
was their job, their political leaders insisted. Florida was too
big to serve as a laboratory, and it cost too much to campaign
there. Besides, the argument went, folks in other states just
didn't have the tradition and interest in choosing the best
candidates.
</P>
<P>
"It's part of the culture here," said Fergus Cullen, the chairman
of the New Hampshire Republican Party. "This is sort of hard for
outsiders to appreciate, and I recognize that. But because the
process has evolved over the last half century, voters take their
role very seriously. We go to forums, go to town meetings, and
make very informed decisions."
</P>
<P>
That's the myth, anyway. But is it true?
</P>
<P>
Hit the ground shivering
</P>
<P>
I arrived in Concord, N.H., around 3 p.m. about a week before the
election. The digital thermometer outside the Merrimack County
Bank read 10 degrees, but Ron Paul supporters were marching back
and forth in the snow along Main Street, dressed like colonists
from the Revolutionary War period.
</P>
<P>
Behind the fogged-up glass walls of Barack Obama's office
downtown, rows of campaign workers called potential supporters to
ask for their votes. Young volunteers from Florida, Virginia and
New York were pouring in, ready to go door-to-door to get out the
votes for their candidates.
</P>
<P>
Nina Hopkins of Henniker, N.H., emerged from the John Edwards
office in downtown Concord with an armful of brochures and loaded
them into her minivan. She and her kids, Brenna, 8, and Micaela,
9, planned to deposit them with neighbors as they walked their
dog.
</P>
<P>
In 2000, Hopkins had supported Arizona Sen. John McCain, a
Republican, but she was won over by Edwards, a former Democratic
senator from North Carolina, and his populist message of change.
That's not the kind of switch you'll see in a lot of states.
</P>
<P>
"We think for ourselves out here. That's why we like the
candidates coming here," she said. "We want to hear them speak,
and ask them questions. We take it very seriously."
</P>
<P>
And then there were the passers-by. After 17 years of covering
government at every level, from sewer commissions to the races
for the U.S. Senate, House and presidency, never have I found so
many people so well-informed. Almost without exception, everyone
I stopped on the street was eager to talk about the upcoming
presidential primaries and, what's more, had a cogent opinion
about whom they liked, and why.
</P>
<P>
Maybe these people weren't packing political events just to get
in out of the cold.
</P>
<P>
There is, indeed, a tradition of direct democracy unlike that in
almost any other state. New Hampshire's state House of
Representatives boasts more members than any other state  there
are 400 of them, in fact, one for about every 3,000 residents.
Almost every supervisory position in local and county government
is elected, and every official  even the governor  must stand for
re-election every two years.
</P>
<P>
Voter turnout typically surpasses 70 percent, nearly 20 percent
higher than the national average.
</P>
<P>
But my first real ah-hah moment came a week ago Saturday. People
had started lining up around 8 a.m. for an 11 a.m. rally with
Sen. Barack Obama at a high school in Nashua. The line soon
stretched about half a mile. Kids drew Obama's name on the
blacktop with chunks of ice. By 10 a.m., more than 2,000 people
were waiting cheerfully, including Craig and Melinda Willever,
who had driven more than an hour from Portsmouth. It was 23
degrees.
</P>
<P>
"We really have an impact on how people vote in this country,"
explained Mr. Willever, 51, a postal worker.
</P>
<P>
Added his wife, an antiques dealer, "It's a privilege."
</P>
<P>
The second defining moment came around noon on Monday, the day
before the election. I was covering Sen. Hillary Clinton, a
Democrat from New York who would narrowly win the primary, at a
town hall meeting in Dover, up near Portsmouth, when I met Wendy
Beagen, 47, of Madbury, N.H.. She was going to see Obama that
night, too.
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't even going to come here today because I've already
heard her speak," Beagan said. "But why not? No one else gets
this chance."
</P>
<P>
She called it an honor.
</P>
<P>
Thinking with ego
</P>
<P>
You'll be hard pressed to convince me that the Democratic leaders
of the four approved early voting states Iowa, New Hampshire,
Nevada and South Carolina  were thinking with their heads when
they pushed the leading Democratic candidates to boycott Florida
after the state moved its primary to Jan. 29, a week earlier than
allowed.
</P>
<P>
They were thinking with their egos.
</P>
<P>
But despite my earlier skepticism, I now believe the argument
that Florida could mess up what seems like a valuable process,
particularly in New Hampshire. Yes, Florida looks more like
America. Yes, winning Florida has become key to winning the
presidency.
</P>
<P>
But New Hampshire doesn't really choose the next president, or
even the next presidential nominees. Its voters last week didn't
anoint Clinton and McCain, who won the Republican contest; they
just let them keep going.
</P>
<P>
The last two presidents  George W. Bush and Bill Clinton, who
together served 16 years  both lost New Hampshire. McCain beat
Bush there in 2000, and you probably don't remember who beat
Clinton in 1992 (the late Sen. Paul Tsongas).
</P>
<P>
Instead, the Granite Staters cull those candidates whose
organizations, ideas or personas just aren't quite ready for
prime time. Their questions and scrutiny prepare the survivors to
meet the rest of us. And from what I can tell, they do a wicked
good job.
