RAMIREZ '  IMPACT ON DODGERS SUCCESS IS UNDENIABLE
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Philadelphia -- For someone who greets teammates with "que paso"
so often it inspired a Dodgers' T-shirt, for someone who grooves
to the irresistibly catchy "Paper Planes" dance lyrics, Manny
Ramirez sure gets taken seriously.
</P>
<P>
Ramirez has taken the Los Angeles Dodgers further than they have
gone in 20 years -- to the National League Championship Series,
which begins Thursday night against the Philadelphia Phillies.
</P>
<P>
But there are critics who'd rather he not enjoy the ride.
</P>
<P>
Fox broadcaster Tim McCarver on Tuesday called Ramirez's exit
from Boston despicable. Ramirez deflected questions about the
comment on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Ramirez has been labeled everything from high-maintenance to
Terrell Owens in dreadlocks.
</P>
<P>
And yet, he continues to hit.
</P>
<P>
That's what Ramirez has always done, since he was a rookie in
Cleveland, since he was a $20 million man in Boston and since he
became a cultural phenomenon in Los Angeles the past three
months.
</P>
<P>
Reasons to pick the Dodgers to advance to the World Series all
eventually come back to Ramirez. He's so good, he helped carry
two teams to the postseason this season. So just scribbling his
name in the lineup, whether he takes a swing or not, makes the
Dodgers better.
</P>
<P>
"I don't know about all that. I just know that I am happy here,"
said Ramirez, who walked through the bowels of Citizens Bank Park
on Wednesday undisturbed and unrecognized in baggy jeans, a white
pullover and music strumming in his ears. "I am enjoying the
game. I play hard and go home happy. If you are dogging it,
that's when you have problems."
</P>
<P>
McCarver is the latest to contend Ramirez did just that in Boston
in order to facilitate his exit. His last days in Boston were
ugly. Ramirez admits that sometimes "he jogged it out" rather
than hustle.
</P>
<P>
But Ramirez has undeniably made an impact in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
With Ramirez in the lineup, the Dodgers' batting average has gone
from .256 to .280. Runs have spiked from 4.2 to 4.7 per game. So
potent is Ramirez that talk here Wednesday centered on what he
won't do -- namely be given the opportunity to squash the
Phillies.
</P>
<P>
"He's as good as it gets right now, we have to make sure we pitch
him intelligently," Phillies closer Brad Lidge said.
</P>
<P>
Shortstop Jimmy Rollins was more blunt:"If Manny is swinging a
hot bat, we better not pitch to him, you let somebody else beat
you."
</P>
<P>
This Dodgers' lineup bears little resemblance to the one that
slogged its way through much of the season. Nomar Garciaparra,
Jeff Kent, Andruw Jones, Juan Pierre and shortstops du jour are
on the bench.
</P>
<P>
While Ramirez has reveled in his role of hero, Rafael Furcal's
return has been just as important in the playoffs. Furcal was one
of baseball's best players when he irritated a disc in his back
on May 5, missing the next 4 1/2 months. The Dodgers were 18-14,
and he was hitting .366.
</P>
<P>
Furcal went 4-for-12 in the division series sweep of the Chicago
Cubs, creating havoc that did not exist with miscast Russell
Martin or Matt Kemp batting leadoff.
</P>
<P>
"He's a lot like Jimmy Rollins, a switch-hitter with power who
can steal bases," Phillies manager Charlie Manuel said.
</P>
<P>
Furcal's return has moved James Loney, a great mistake hitter,
into a run-producing spot, with trade acquisition Casey Blake
left to give professional at-bats at the bottom of the lineup.
</P>
<P>
"When Blake got here, that's when things started to change,"
Dodgers manager Joe Torre said. "He's been the glue."
</P>
<P>
Ramirez, though, is the guy Phillies' fans don't want up in a
sticky situation. There is nothing about his October performance
that is a fluke. He has hit safely in 38 of his past 43 playoff
games (57-for-163), and homered twice in the Cubs' brooming.
</P>
<P>
"I look at Manny in this series like Barry Bonds," Manuel said.
"He will make you change your ideas on things. He puts pressure
on you because you know he can beat you."
