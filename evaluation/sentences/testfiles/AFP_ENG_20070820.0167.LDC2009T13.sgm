A strong earthquake of magnitude 6.5 hit the southern Philippines
on Monday, the United States Geological Survey said.
</P>
<P>
The quake's epicentre was reported to be 209 kilometres south
east of the town of Mati in Davao Oriental on Mindanao Island.
</P>
<P>
Mylene Carols of the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and
Seismology (Philvolcs) told AFP the quake was felt along the east
coast of the island but there were no reports of damage or
injuries.
</P>
<P>
"The quake's epicentre was out at sea and not on land," she said.
</P>
<P>
"From our initial reports it was about 10 kilometres below the
surface," she said, adding that no tsunami warning has been
issued.
</P>
<P>
The quake occurred at 9.46pm local time (1346 GMT), according to
the USGS report.
</P>
<P>
"There is only a small chance of a tsunami because we use
magnitude seven and below as our cut off point," said Philvolcs's
Angelito Lunuza.
</P>
<P>
"Although we have not issued a tsunami warning we have asked all
our  stations along the east coast to monitor any changes in sea
levels just in case," he said.

<P>
The archipelago nation, made up of more than 7,000 islands, sits
on the Pacific "Ring of Fire" where continental plates collide,
causing frequent seismic and volcanic activity.
