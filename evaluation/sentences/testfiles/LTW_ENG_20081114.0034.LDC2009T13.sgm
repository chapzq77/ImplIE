LAGUNA BEACH, Calif.
</P>
<P>
For Trey Russell, "less is more" is not just a modernist creed
but a way of life. In his boutique, Aris, and his second-story
garden apartment behind the shop, there is a pared-down yet
luxurious aesthetic on display.
</P>
<P>
Art books in both home and store sit in low, color-coordinated
stacks. A row of dark wood boxes in graduated sizes -- think
Russian nesting dolls -- hide the clutter of DVDs, playing cards
and remote controls. Objets d'art are deftly juxtaposed: a
Nymphenburg porcelain rhinoceros and a grouping of black
jacketless books; an Anne Ricketts sculpture of a bronze hand and
a slender hourglass.  One floral arrangement consists simply of a
pale-yellow dahlia floating in a Chinese bowl.
</P>
<P>
"Whether you're displaying merchandise in a store or objects in
your home, it's important to give each object breathing room,"
Russell says. "I treat each accessory as a piece of art; in a
small space, you want everything to be important."
</P>
<P>
For the engaging Russell, merchandising his gift store -- a
melange of home furnishings, high-end fashion, consignment
clothing, jewelry, teas, chocolates and fresh seasonal flowers --
is like putting together a big puzzle. "Every day I get
deliveries of new merchandise," he says. "I have to make it all
fit in a small space and make it look attractive." Which is
precisely the challenge so many people face in their homes,
particularly as they prepare for the onslaught of holiday parties
and houseguests.
</P>
<P>
Russell uses his 1,100-square-foot apartment overlooking the
rooftops of north Laguna Beach as an extension of the store. It's
as minimalist and restrained as a Beverly Hills boutique. Lilac-
gray and violet-slate walls create a perfect foil for his
collection of well-edited furnishings, upholstered in a subtle
palette of soothing alabaster, beige, gray and chocolate. Like
his store, a stylish mix of affordable goods -- Pottery Barn
shelves, West Elm bookcases and Crate &amp; Barrel chairs -- keep
company with Christian Liaigre consoles, stingray tables from
France and $3,000 Caleb Siemon art vases.
</P>
<P>
"Style is not about money, but about the mix. I want customers to
be able to see the things I sell in my store in a home-like
setting. There's no reason a one-bedroom apartment can't be just
as stylish as a 5,000-square-foot home," says Russell, who can be
seen most days dressed in smart yet casual attire -- white Gap
jeans, a Polo tee and a jaunty, custom-made linen hat.
</P>
<P>
Russell keeps his clothes in a well-disciplined bedroom closet.
The only furnishings in the room are his California king-size bed
and a wall-mounted TV. When he added the bed, the wood closet
doors could no longer open, so in typical fashion, the inventive
retailer made changes.
</P>
<P>
New slate-gray, Belgian linen drapes, attached by rings to a
metal track, pull back to reveal sports jackets arranged in a
trio of subtle, earthy hues. Like items, such as V-neck sweaters,
cashmere crews, short-sleeved Polos, long-sleeved Polos and
button-down shirts, are precisely folded and stacked in neat
piles -- not so surprising, since Russell once worked as a
fashion sales associate.
</P>
<P>
"I'm an expert in the art of folding," he quips.
</P>
<P>
"Seriously, most people have way too much stuff in their closets
-- and their homes. There's no reason to keep a raincoat hanging
365 days of the year when you live in Southern California --
really. Just leave out things you really wear and love, and stash
the rest away."
</P>
<P>
Good advice, especially for those residing in space-challenged
apartments.
</P>
<P>
Just 10 years ago, Russell was living in Florida and working in
the hospitality business when he decided to make the move from
restaurant to retail and head west.
</P>
<P>
"I was more interested in watching CNN's `Style with Elsa Klinch'
and reading Metropolitan Home magazine than in food and wine," he
says.
</P>
<P>
For the next five years, the garrulous Russell worked as a
personal shopper for Prada, followed by a stint at A'Maree's, a
high-fashion boutique in nearby Newport Beach. He spent his spare
time as a power seller on eBay, marketing high-end fashion and
holding trunk shows at home to recycle "hardly worn haute
couture."
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, he opened his version of a shop -- a gift
boutique, he calls it -- in a former 1950s Volkswagen dealership.
Russell runs it like a friendly neighborhood restaurant.
</P>
<P>
Customers are welcomed with offers of Pellegrino, cappuccino or a
cup of Marco Polo Mariages Freres tea. Then there are the snacks
served family-style -- Java chips with spicy hummus, a bowl of
chocolate almonds or ice pops for kids. On Saturdays, regulars
know that mimosas and strawberries are served in the garden
behind the store -- all the better to wander into his nearby
annex -- two rooms beneath his apartment building that offer
consignment clothing and Missoni linens.
</P>
<P>
But how does it feel when everything in your home is for sale,
one might wonder?
</P>
<P>
Although he won't part with his pair of antique tortoise shells
-- "they're family heirlooms," he says -- everything else has a
price.
</P>
<P>
"Just the other day, a woman customer came in and fell in love
with my linen sofa -- gone," he says with a smile. "It's OK. I'll
make a new one. Change is always good."
