DOUBTS ARISE ON HOW A PAKISTANI COACH DIED
</HEADLINE>

PROVIDENCIALES, Turks and Caicos
</P>
<P>
Was it enraged gamblers who strangled the coach? Or vindictive
players? Or a fan with a grudge?
</P>
<P>
Or none of the above? The latest twist in the Jamaican police
investigation into the death of Bob Woolmer, the Pakistani
cricket coach found unconscious in his hotel room in March during
the Cricket World Cup, may be that he was not murdered at all.
</P>
<P>
Quoting people close to Dr. Nat Carey, a top British pathologist
called in to review the postmortem on Woolmer, newspapers in
Britain, where Woolmer was from, and Jamaica, where he died, are
raising questions about the Jamaican authorities' claim that
Woolmer was strangled.
</P>
<P>
The papers say Carey has determined that his review of the
records does not show that Woolmer died of "asphyxia as a result
of manual strangulation," as the Jamaican government has
maintained.
</P>
<P>
A Jamaican pathologist, Ere Seshiah, originally ruled that
Woolmer's death on March 18 was inconclusive. Four days later,
the government changed course and told the world in a dramatic
news conference that the popular coach had been murdered.
</P>
<P>
The police say the murder investigation continues despite the
news reports that Woolmer might have died of natural causes.
</P>
<P>
"Every theory, from weed killer to aconite, has come from the
media, not the police," Mark Shields, the deputy police
commissioner, told the Jamaica Observer newspaper on Monday from
South Africa, where he was traveling on police business. "We
maintain that this is an ongoing murder investigation."
</P>
<P>
What made Woolmer's sudden death so suspicious is that it came in
the evening after his highly regarded team lost to Ireland in a
huge World Cup upset and became the first team to be eliminated
from the tournament.
</P>
<P>
The key piece of evidence pointing toward strangulation was said
to be a broken bone in Woolmer's neck. But that could have
broken, the speculation now goes, as Woolmer fell after dying
from a heart attack or other natural causes.
</P>
<P>
If the case has been bungled, Jamaicans worry that their country
may suffer.
</P>
<P>
Derrick Smith, a member of Parliament from the opposition Jamaica
Labor Party, said this week that the confusion raised by the
conflicting accounts jeopardized the reputation of the Jamaican
police.
</P>
<P>
"Announcements emerging from police and medical authorities in
both Britain and Pakistan indicate that Woolmer's death was from
natural causes and not murder as suggested by the Jamaica police
authorities," Smith said at a news conference on Monday,
according to The Associated Press. "The matter has become a
global embarrassment for us."
</P>
<P>
Saying the case has gone from a "great 'whodunit"' into a
farcical soap opera, The Gleaner, Jamaica's leading newspaper,
called on police to release the pathology report so people can
decide what the authorities cannot.
</P>
<P>
Another possibility remains, and that is that Woolmer was
poisoned instead of choked.
</P>
<P>
Various reports have indicated that there were signs that Woolmer
had ingested a herbicide used as a weed killer on cricket
pitches. The herbicide might have caused the vomiting and
diarrhea that Woolmer suffered before he died.
