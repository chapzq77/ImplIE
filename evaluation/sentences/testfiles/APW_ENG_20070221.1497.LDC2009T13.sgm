Italy ' s Prodi resign after losing Senate vote on Afghanistan
mission

ROME 2007-02-21 22:19:09 UTC

<P>
Italian Premier Romano Prodi resigned Wednesday after his center-
left government embarrassingly lost a Senate vote on foreign
policy, including the country's military mission in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
His diverse coalition -- which has been squabbling since he took
office only nine months ago -- failed to close ranks and support
Prodi's government, with the radical left balking at the idea of
giving unquestioned backing to Italy's traditional pro-U.S.
policies.
</P>
<P>
Only a week earlier, Prodi had forbidden his Cabinet ministers
from joining a march to protest the expansion of a U.S. military
base in Vicenza, northern Italy. On Wednesday, his Green and
Communist coalition partners managed to voice their objections by
rejecting Prodi's entire foreign policy statement.
</P>
<P>
Italian President Giorgio Napolitano, as head of state, asked
Prodi to stay on in a caretaker role while he determines which
political leaders might be able to muster enough support for a
parliamentary majority -- thus avoiding the need for new
elections, far ahead of their 2011 schedule.
</P>
<P>
Prodi was smiling in the back seat of a limousine as he left the
presidential palace and made no comment to reports.
</P>
<P>
Prodi aides did not rule out the possibility that Napolitano
would ask Prodi to try to form a new government, and from first
discussions among some allies, support for another Prodi
government seemed to be building.
</P>
<P>
"We are ready to reconfirm our full trust in the Prodi
government," said Dario Franceschini, a leader of the Olive Tree,
the largest grouping in Prodi's coalition.
</P>
<P>
"Let's hope the consultations will be useful to clear things up"
and to drum up support for putting together another government.
</P>
<P>
Napolitano planned to meet Thursday morning with the leaders in
the Senate and the lower Chamber of Deputies.
</P>
<P>
The government lost the Senate motion by two votes, despite
Foreign Minister Massimo D'Alema's calling for the coalition's
forces -- which range from Christian Democrats to Communists --
to support Prodi's policies, including Italy's continued mission
in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The Cabinet approved a decree for continued funding of the
Afghanistan mission, but without the support of three leftists in
the government. The decree awaits parliamentary approval.
</P>
<P>
Italy deployed 1,800 troops to join NATO's mission in Afghanistan
under Prodi's predecessor, conservative leader Silvio Berlusconi.
</P>
<P>
Prodi defeated Berlusconi in April elections to take office in
May, with Italy's 61st government since the end of World War II.
His coalition holds a comfortable margin in the lower
parliamentary house, but a razor-thin edge in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
Berlusconi had predicted Prodi's government would collapse
because of the radical leftists in the coalition. It was not
clear Wednesday if Berlusconi, who had a pacemaker implanted in
December, would make another bid for power.
</P>
<P>
A Christian Democrat opposition leader, Pier Ferdinando Casini,
predicted it would be tough for Prodi to try to put together a
new government.
</P>
<P>
"He pretends not to see" his problems in mustering a majority,
Casini said in an interview on state TV. "If he wants to go
ahead, good luck," but "the country is paying the price."
</P>
<P>
Prodi could try to reach out now to centrists in the opposition,
but it was unlikely they would agree to join any government
including leftists that sometimes support anti-Vatican policies.
</P>
<P>
Prodi's government needed 160 Senate votes to win backing for its
foreign policy program. It received just 158 votes, and 24
senators abstained -- which in the Senate is equivalent to a "no"
vote.
</P>
<P>
Prodi is an economist and former head of a now defunct Italian
state industrial conglomerate who is generally pro-Vatican,
although recent approval by his government for a proposed law to
give some legal rights to same-sex and other unmarried couples
angered the Catholic Church.
</P>
<P>
His approval rating had dropped in recent months, after a brief
tenure which saw him wage an uphill battle to liberalize Italy's
economy.
</P>
<P>
He kept his campaign pledge to withdraw all of Italy's troops
from Iraq by the end of 2006.
