Ransoms fueling kidnappings in oil-rich Nigeria -- and govt
officials taking a cut, gangs say

LAGOS, Nigeria 2007-07-11 17:33:16 UTC
</P>
<P>
In Nigeria's oil-rich south, foreign workers are known as "white
gold" among the gangs who kidnap them for ransom.
</P>
<P>
"Ah, the whites are coming," chuckled one young gang member --
sipping beer in a ramshackle, roadside bar -- as a heavily
guarded oil company convoy sped through traffic-choked Port
Harcourt, sirens blaring. "It's like the vans for ice creams in
your country."
</P>
<P>
Nigeria is Africa's largest producer of crude oil, known as
"black gold." But the country is in the grip of a kidnapping
epidemic, with more than 150 foreigners seized so far this year,
including a woman and a child -- nearly the total for all of last
year.
</P>
<P>
The attacks have contributed to a drop in production of about 25
percent, driving up oil prices worldwide with no end to the
string of kidnappings in sight.
</P>
<P>
Ransoms are fueling the surge, gang members and oil industry
officials say. They also claim a cut goes to the government
officials who shuttle between the charm-bedecked, rifle-toting
gunmen in the swamps and professional negotiators flown in from
Paris or London.
</P>
<P>
"Absolutely not true," Rivers state spokesman Emmanuel Okah said
earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
But a militant from the Movement for the Emancipation of the
Niger Delta, a group behind a number of high-profile kidnappings
said all sides pocket a portion of the ransom.
</P>
<P>
"Practically everyone involved in hostage negotiations has had
his hands soiled," the militant said by e-mail on condition of
anonymity. "Officials merely up the demands of the abductors and
keep the rest to themselves, most times unknown to the
abductors."
</P>
<P>
One oil worker recounted how his captors and visiting officials
argued over his ransom. The kidnappers insisted they had asked
for more than twice the offered amount; officials said it had
been stolen when they left the cash unattended. He said he
remained in captivity while they were sent back for more.
</P>
<P>
In another case, Nigerian security forces threatened to kill a
hostage if he revealed the discrepancy between what his company
paid and what his kidnappers received, a security expert said.
</P>
<P>
"In many cases, the proportion of released funds that ends up in
the hands of the kidnappers is unknown," another security
professional said, speaking on condition of anonymity. "State or
local government officials are keen to act as the intermediaries
in kidnap negotiations."
</P>
<P>
It's a delicate subject. Company officials refuse to discuss
ransoms for fear of alienating powerful local interests or
becoming targets themselves. Former hostages fear retribution
from ex-captors or losing their job if they talk to the media.
Even gang members fear speaking out, even though they often serve
as hired muscle during elections and frequently engage in violent
clashes between themselves.
</P>
<P>
The ex-hostage, security professionals and the gang member asked
that no further details be published to protect their identity,
and most of those who talked to The Associated Press about
government collusion in kidnappings asked for anonymity for
similar reasons.
</P>
<P>
Few companies have a direct line to the kidnappers. When four
Agip employees were kidnapped late last year, the militant group
holding them said the company spent a total of US$1.5 million
trying to secure their release through various middlemen, a
charge denied by Agip's parent company, Eni SpA.
</P>
<P>
"The company has never paid any ransom for the release of its
employees kidnapped in Nigeria," a spokeswoman said from Rome,
speaking on condition of anonymity on accordance with company
policy.
</P>
<P>
No oil company has ever publicly admitted paying for hostages,
but militants insist it happens.
</P>
<P>
"Agip has so far lost more than 200 million naira (US$1.5
million) to various con artists," the militant group said in an
e-mail before announcing that the ransom -- allegedly unsolicited
-- had been "confiscated."
</P>
<P>
The militants, who claim to kidnap as part of a campaign for
political concessions and a greater share of oil revenues for the
poverty-stricken region, appeared to be trying to distinguish
themselves from criminal gangs that kidnap for money.
</P>
<P>
Yet the web of connections among the militants, the criminals and
the government is more tangled than the roots of the steamy
mangrove swamps where the hostages are held.
</P>
<P>
The militant group balked when pressed for more details on
government involvement. "I never wish to seem like a snitch,"
said a spokesman, who denied soliciting ransoms.
</P>
<P>
But one state official admitted to the AP that he took cash
during the Agip kidnapping. He spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
Okah, the Rivers state spokesman, said no ransom was paid to
secure the freedom Sunday of British 3-year-old Margaret Hill,
the first foreign child snatched in the region. He said the state
government no longer doles out cash from shadowy slush funds
following a federal order last year prohibited ransom payments.
</P>
<P>
In 2006, the Rivers state government allocated nearly US$40
million as a "security vote," up from $US27 million the year
before. No records are available on how the money has been spent
or how much has been allocated this year.
</P>
<P>
"In the early stage, the state government facilitated releases,"
Okah acknowledged. "Now, it's individuals ... who pay ransoms."
</P>
<P>
And the kidnappings are escalating. Two foreigners were taken
captive Sunday, and five seized last Wednesday were held for a
week before being released, police said.
</P>
<P>
And expatriates aren't the only targets. Two senior Nigerian
managers of Royal Dutch Shell PLC were seized last Saturday
before being released Wednesday, according to colleagues, and two
Nigerian toddlers have been taken captive in the past.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria is second only to Iraq as the country with the greatest
risk of kidnap of foreign workers, the firm ASI Global Response
says.
</P>
<P>
The root causes behind the kidnappings -- poverty, corruption and
lawlessness -- must be tackled before the country degenerates
into a Colombia-style situation in which any wealthy person is a
potential victim, regardless of employer or nationality, said
Dimieari von Kemedi, a human rights lawyer working in the Delta.
</P>
<P>
"A time may come when anyone wearing a tie is a target," he
warned.
