AT OKLAHOMA, THE GAME IS IN THEIR BLOOD

NORMAN, Okla.
</P>

The University of Oklahoma basketball team takes the floor and
the names on the jerseys are familiar, if the context is not.
Olajuwon. Roethlisberger. Paris. Hand. There is a spark of
recognition and the conjuring of male sporting excellence. But
these players are women, and their names also serve as signposts
on the long road to acceptance and opportunity.
</P>
<P>
Three and a half decades after the passage of the gender-equity
legislation known as Title IX, daughters and sisters of highly
accomplished and famous athletes are lending women's college
basketball greater skill, athleticism, visibility and celebrity.
Nowhere is that more evident than at Oklahoma, home of the
nation's sixth-ranked team, where athletic pedigree may be
unmatched by any other team in the country, male or female. Most
of the Sooners' 13-player roster is composed of the children of
high-level athletes.
</P>
<P>
Oklahoma's 6-foot-4 reserve center, Abi Olajuwon, a junior, is
the daughter of the Hall of Famer Hakeem Olajuwon.
</P>
<P>
Carlee Roethlisberger, a 6-1 sophomore forward, is the sister of
Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger.
</P>
<P>
Center Courtney Paris, a 6-4 senior and the 2006 national player
of the year, and her twin, Ashley, a forward, are the daughters
of Bubba Paris, who won three Super Bowl rings as an offensive
tackle with the San Francisco 49ers.
</P>
<P>
Whitney Hand, a 6-1 freshman guard, is a daughter of Rich Hand,
who pitched in the major leagues for Cleveland, Texas and the
California Angels.
</P>
<P>
The opportunities afforded by Title IX have dovetailed with the
desire of elite athletes for their children to have similar
chances to excel, Oklahoma coach Sherri Coale said. But fathers
are not the only influence on female athletes. Increasingly, the
role models for this second generation of Title IX competitors
are likely to include their mothers. The mothers of Carlee
Roethlisberger and Danielle Robinson, the Sooners' point guard,
played college basketball, while the mother of guard Lauren
Willis was an all-American track and field athlete.
</P>
<P>
Having parents who were standout athletes "completely deters you
and you don't want be around sports, or does the opposite and
inspires you," said Jessica Mendoza, the president-elect of the
Women's Sports Foundation and a two-time Olympic medalist in
softball. Her father was a college football player and coach.
</P>
<P>
"A while back, a lot of dads and moms didn't want their daughters
to play sports," Mendoza said. "They were fearful they wouldn't
be the ideal daughter. Now parents are dying to have their
daughters influenced by athletics. Not just for the sweating, but
for what they can learn -- leadership, self-confidence, body
image, which is a huge issue with girls."
</P>
<P>
The gender playing field is not yet level 26 years after the NCAA
began to sponsor women's basketball. Women's teams still scramble
for equitable financing and practice time in the gym. Still, as a
critical mass of participation is being reached, women are now
regularly performing with the same expectations and the same
success as family members who excelled before them.
</P>
<P>
Maya Moore, of top-ranked Connecticut, who is considered by many
to be the best college women's player in the country, reached the
2008 women's Final Four as a freshman, 32 years after her father,
Mike Dabney, played in the men's Final Four with Rutgers. Meagan
and Lauren Cowher, daughters of Bill Cowher, the former Steelers
coach and NFL player, played basketball at Princeton. Kate and
Meg Bulger, sisters of the St. Louis Rams quarterback Marc
Bulger, played at West Virginia. Cheryl Ford, the daughter of the
former NBA forward Karl Malone, was an honorable mention all-
American at Louisiana Tech and has won three league titles with
Detroit in the WNBA.
</P>
<P>
"I think that's a natural evolutionary process based on
opportunities afforded women, whether it be male athletes or
female athletes whose children are exposed to sports at an early
age," said Coale, who coached Oklahoma to the national title game
in 2002. "They get a mind-set for that. It's sort of a way of
life for them. They grow up with big dreams."
</P>
<P>
Parents who were star athletes may be more likely to take an
interest in their daughters' athletic activities, instruct them
and participate in sports with them, said Christine A. Baker, the
author of "Why She Plays: The World of Women's Basketball." A
number of the Oklahoma players were coached by their parents as
young girls. Brenda Roethlisberger started a parent-daughter
league at the YMCA in Findlay, Ohio, so that Carlee could have
the same grade-school opportunities to play as Ben.
</P>
<P>
Courtney Paris said her father spoke often about the dedication
necessary to become an elite athlete. Rich Hand, the former
pitcher who became a high school coach, said that children of
superb athletes were perhaps less coddled by their parents. But
Coale cautioned against the notion that children of high-profile
athletes, as a group, had a better understanding of the
commitment required to succeed and a greater willingness than
others to work hard.
</P>
<P>
"The only commonality I find is that they tend not to be so blown
away by the stage, by the media attention, the travel," Coale
said.
</P>
<P>
She is now recruiting the daughter of the Pro Football Hall of
Fame running back Tony Dorsett. Already, Oklahoma's roster is
startling in its lineage: J.C. Hartman, the grandfather of guard
Jasmine Hartman, was a Negro Leagues all-star and the first
African-American player for the Houston Astros franchise, then
the Colt .45s. Mike Winchester, the father of guard Carolyn
Winchester, was the punter for Oklahoma's 1985 national
championship football team. Bill Vining, the grandfather of guard
Jenny Vining, won 520 games coaching basketball at Ouachita
Baptist University in Arkansas. Bryon Russell, the cousin of
forward Amanda Thompson, played 13 years in the NBA.
</P>
<P>
Denise Carr-Robinson played basketball at Hampton University in
Virginia in the mid-'70s, when scholarships were scarce, the team
traveled in an un-air-conditioned school bus and the uniforms
amounted to T-shirts with numbers attached. When her daughter,
Danielle, the Sooners' point guard, began to show interest,
Denise insisted that she properly learn basketball's
fundamentals. At dusk at the family home in San Jose, Calif.,
Danielle said, her father would admonish her to come inside while
her mother would tell her to stay outside until she had made a
string of consecutive layups.
</P>
<P>
"She says I'm blessed and I can't let this opportunity pass me
by," Danielle said.
</P>
<P>
A couple of the Sooners have not one but two parents who were
exceptional athletes. Carlee Roethlisberger's mother, Brenda,
played basketball at MidAmerica Nazerene University in Kansas,
while her father, Ken, was a quarterback and a pitcher at Georgia
Tech. Lauren Willis' father, Steve, was a kicker at Kansas State.
Her mother, Lois, was an all-American quarter-miler in the
4x400-meter relay at Iowa State and the 1984 Big Eight Conference
champion in the triple jump.
</P>
<P>
Several parents said that as stereotypes about the femininity of
female athletes had faded, elite male athletes seemingly had
become more eager to marry elite female athletes instead of say,
models or cheerleaders. A result for their children is a double
dip in the athletic gene pool.
</P>
<P>
"That's not why I married my husband, hoping to have good,
athletic kids," Lois Willis said. "It does cross your mind,
though."
</P>
<P>
Lauren Willis said she remembered running at a track in the third
grade while her parents raced each other in Overland Park, Kan.
Competition in the family was keen. Her father once asked her,
"What do you call somebody who overtrains?"
</P>
<P>
"Psycho," she said.
</P>
<P>
"No, a champion," he said.
</P>
<P>
Family history is now repeating itself. Steve and Lois Willis
were walk-ons in college. So is Lauren. She rejected scholarship
offers from other colleges, wanting to play at Oklahoma because
it was more highly regarded. She persisted to the point of
chasing down Coale at a game while in high school and handing her
an envelope containing her videotaped highlights.
</P>
<P>
"When Lauren wanted to go for this, we didn't want to put
limitations on her because we didn't put limitations on
ourselves," Steve Willis said of himself and his wife. "I suspect
had neither one of us had success at a higher level, we probably
would have told Lauren not to go for her dream and take the sure
bet" of a scholarship.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, pressure and expectation can be burdensome for
the children of top athletes. Abi Olajuwon said she refrained
from playing basketball until age 13 for that reason. "There's
always going to be someone to criticize and there's going to be
that comparison," she said. "All I can say is, thank God I'm not
a boy, or it would just be horrible. If I was a guy playing in
college now, I wouldn't hear the end of it."
</P>
<P>
Even for the most talented athletes, athletic forebears cannot
guarantee success or contentment. The nation's top female
basketball recruit of 2008, Elena Delle Donne of Wilmington,
Del., whose father played basketball and golf at Columbia
University, left UConn last summer, saying she was burned out on
basketball. She decided to play volleyball at Delaware instead.
</P>
<P>
Ken Roethlisberger said that he encouraged Carlee to play a
variety of sports, believing it was detrimental to specialize at
a young age. Carlee and Ben also played against each other in the
driveway. Ben did not take it easy on her, Carlee said, because
he knew that no one else would. She found his success something
to celebrate and emulate, not to shrink from.
</P>
<P>
"If people said, 'You're not as good as your brother,' I said,
'Well, let me show you,"' Carlee said.
</P>
<P>
After Ben graduated from Findlay High School in Ohio, she
promptly broke his school scoring record.
