Yitzhak Rabin's convicted assassin is pleased with the election
victory of hardline opposition leader Benjamin Netanyahu, the inmate's
lawyer said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Yigal Amir, a right-wing extremist, killed Rabin last November in
hopes of wrecking the prime minister's land-for-peace agreements with
the Palestinians. In the wake of the assassination, Rabin's successor,
Shimon Peres, called early elections May 29.

<P>
In the vote, Peres was narrowly defeated by Netanyahu by less than
29,500 votes out of nearly 3 million cast. Netanyahu has said he would
take a tougher stance in the negotiations with the Palestinians, and
block the creation of a Palestinian state.

<P>
``Yigal Amir said he voted for Benjamin Netanyahu and he is of course
happy that Benjamin Netanyahu was elected,'' defense attorney Shmuel
Flishman said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Amir cast his vote last week at his prison near the southern Negev
Desert town of Beersheba where he is serving a life sentence.
</P>
<P>
Rabin's widow, Leah, called the fact that Amir was allowed to vote
``an unprecedented scandal.'' ga-kl
