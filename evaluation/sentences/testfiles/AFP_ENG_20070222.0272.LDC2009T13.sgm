SKorean president cuts ruling party ties, PM offers to quit
</HEADLINE>

<P>
South Korea's unpopular President Roh Moo-Hyun cut ties with the
ruling Uri Party on Thursday and the premier offered to quit,
officials said, in changes thought linked to December's
presidential poll.
</P>
<P>
Roh announced his departure during a dinner with Uri party
leaders, presidential spokesman Yoon Seung-Yong told reporters.
It leaves him as a political neutral for his last year in office.
</P>
<P>
"I have hesitated about leaving the party amid heated debate
about it. But I decided to leave in order to help eliminate
intra-party conflict," Roh was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Han Myeong-sook offered to resign at the same
dinner, the Yonhap news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The 62-year-old, South Korea's first female prime minister,
intends to run for president and is set to represent left-leaning
Uri and its allies, Yonhap had reported earlier.
</P>
<P>
Roh has repeatedly said he might quit Uri, apparently to push
through constitutional reforms and allow it to rebuild support
ahead of the presidential poll.
</P>
<P>
Roh wants to shift from the current five-year, single-term
presidency to a four- year, two-term system to promote political
stability, even though he  himself cannot benefit.
</P>
<P>
The president's support ratings are currently at around 20
percent, although they have improved since plunging to nearly 10
percent late last year.
</P>
<P>
Some critics say Roh's low ratings are cutting support for his
party, which has an approval rating of little more than 10
percent compared to some 50 percent for the conservative
opposition Grand National Party.
</P>
<P>
The opposition said the president's departure was designed to
deflect criticism of his administration's perceived failure to
combat an economic slowdown and high unemployment.
