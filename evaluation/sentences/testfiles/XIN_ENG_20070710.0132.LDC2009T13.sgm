<P>
More than 1.1 million tourists traveled to Tibet in the first six
months of the year, up 86.3 percent over the same period last
year, according to the local tourism authority.
</P>
<P>
The booming influx of tourists brought 990.3 million yuan (130
million U.S. dollars) in revenue to the Himalayan region, an
increase of 92.1 percent, statistics from the tourism bureau of
the Tibet Autonomous Region show.
</P>
<P>
More than one million of the tourists were Chinese and 73,000
came from abroad, spending almost 24 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Tourism officials attributed the growth in tourist numbers to
promotional efforts and the Qinghai-Tibet Railway, which began
operation on July 1, 2006.
</P>
<P>
The world's highest railway line linking the Tibetan capital of
Lhasa to the rest of China carried 1.5 million passengers into
Tibet in its first year.
</P>
<P>
The number of tourists flying to Tibet increased slightly in the
first six months while more people chose to drive their own
vehicles.
</P>
<P>
This year Tibet expects to host three million tourists bringing
in 3.4 billion yuan (447 million U.S. dollars), according to the
regional development and reform commission.
