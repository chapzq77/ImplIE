KINSHASA, April 16 (Xinhua)
</P>
<P>
The International Criminal Court (ICC) will charge Thomas
Lubanga, Democratic Republic of Congo ( DRC)'s former warlord
with forcefully recruiting children into his Congolese Patriotic
Front (FPC) militia, according to judiciary sources.
</P>
<P>
It was confirmed by Paul Madidi, coordinator of ICC activities in
the DRC.
</P>
<P>
Lubanga who is being held at Hague, has been investigated for
numerous crimes including war crimes against humanity, but the
ICC prosecutor in Bunia, a major town in Ituri, eastern DRC has
been unable to gather enough evidence to sustain further charges
against the former warlord.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on Sunday, Lubanga's lawyers who sought to clarify the
status of the charges against their client said that the
recruitment of child soldiers had also been undertaken by other
Ituri warlords, calling on the ICC to instigate proceedings
against these warlords.
