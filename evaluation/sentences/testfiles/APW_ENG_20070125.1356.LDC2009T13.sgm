MIDDLESBROUGH, England 2007-01-25 16:31:19 UTC
</P>
<P>
Middlesbrough completed its first January transfer signing on
Thursday when South Korea striker Lee Dong-Gook was awarded a
work permit.
</P>
<P>
Lee signed an 18-month contract after arriving on a free transfer
from Pohang Steelers. Terms of the 27-year-old striker's contract
were not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
Lee returned to South Korea to obtain his visa and is expected to
join Middlesbrough next week.
</P>
<P>
Lee missed last summer's World Cup in Germany due to a cruciate
ligament injury. He has scored 22 goals in 64 appearances for the
national side.
</P>
<P>
Also on Thursday, Middlesbrough released defender Ugo Ehiogu and
midfielder Ray Parlour.
</P>
<P>
Ehiogu signed with Rangers on Monday. The 34-year-old Ehiogu was
once the club's record signing at 8 million pounds (US$15.7
million; euro12.1 million).
</P>
<P>
Parlour played 60 games at Teeside after joining from Arsenal in
July 2004. The former England international scored 32 goals in
468 games at Highbury.

BLACKBURN, England (AP) -- Blackburn midfielder Robbie Savage
could return after only three months after undergoing successful
surgery on his broken leg.
</P>
<P>
The 32-year-old Wales international was initially expected to
miss six months after breaking his right leg in Tuesday's 2-1
loss at Watford, but manager Mark Hughes is confident Savage will
return before the end of the season.
</P>
<P>
"It was a straightforward operation -- it was just a case of
setting the bone and getting him on the road to recovery," Hughes
said. "He's obviously very down, he loves playing football. He
doesn't want to be out for any significant period but he'll have
to come to terms with that."
</P>
<P>
Blackburn is 10th in the Premier League with 31 points.

WOLVERHAMPTON, England (AP) -- Brian Kennedy -- owner of Rugby
Union club Sale -- was revealed as the financial backer behind a
failed takeover of Wolves on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Former Liverpool player Graeme Souness was the face of the
Kennedy consortium that failed in a 20 million pounds (US$39.3
million; euro30.3 million) bid for Wolves on Jan. 18.
</P>
<P>
"We have always known the identity of those involved," chief
executive Jez Moxey said. "Our position, which was stated last
week, has not changed."
</P>
<P>
Owner Jack Hayward said he would sell Wolves to anyone willing to
invest at least 20 million pounds in the League Championship
side, which is 10th in the standings with 43 points.

LEICESTER, England (AP) -- Milan Mandaric's takeover of Leicester
City has stalled after the former Portsmouth chairman traveled to
Serbia on Thursday to tend to his ill mother.
</P>
<P>
Manderic made an official bid for the League Championship team on
Nov. 1. The amount offered was reported to be 25 million pounds
(US$47.5 million; euro37.5 million).
</P>
<P>
The Serbian-born American traveled to Belgrade, Serbia, after his
86-year-old mother was admitted to hospital.
</P>
<P>
Mandaric, who was chairman at Porstmouth for eight years, would
become the third American to own an England-based team.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Tampa Bay Buccaneers owner Malcolm Glazer took over at
Manchester United, and two months ago Randy Lerner completed his
takeover of Birmingham-based Aston Villa.

using abusive language toward a match official by the Football
Association on Thursday.

scored the equalizer in a 1-1 draw at Craven Cottage on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Coleman has until Feb. 7 to respond to the charges.
