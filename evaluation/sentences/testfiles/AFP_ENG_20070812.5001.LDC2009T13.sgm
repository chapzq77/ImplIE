Football: Essien backs African Nations Cup switch
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Chelsea's Ghana midfielder Michael Essien wants to see a change
in the international calendar which would allow the African
Nations Cup to move to a new date.
</P>
<P>
The next edition of the tournament, held every two years, will
take place in Ghana in January 2008 and is the top prize in
African football.
</P>
<P>
But it means around a month out of Premiership action for those
picked, with Chelsea braced to lose Essien, Didier Drogba, Mikel
John Obi and Salomon Kalou.
</P>
<P>
Essien believes that making it an out-of-season competition like
the European Championships would have the support of players who
do not want to miss a chunk of the Premier League campaign.
</P>
<P>
"If they can change it would be good for us, we the players and
it would be good the clubs too," said Essien.
</P>
<P>
"You have to leave in January which is a difficult month for the
club, but you have to leave and go and help your country. If they
can change it would be good for us."
</P>
<P>
Boss Jose Mourinho has planned for the loss of his African
players as Chelsea look to win the title back from Manchester
United, although Essien and Drogba in particular have been seen
as vital to their challenge.
</P>
<P>
"I think the new players here are really very good, they fit in
really well," added Essien.
</P>
<P>
"I think we have good players to fit in whilst we are away, so I
don't think it will be a problem. I hope not."
