Red Cross repatriates Moroccan PoWs from Western Sahara
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The international Red Cross on Wednesday repatriated 100 Moroccan
prisoners of war who had been held by Polisario Front separatists who
want independence for Western Sahara, the Sahrawi SPS news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
Polisario announced the release of the prisoners in a gesture of
goodwill to mark a Muslim feast day on February 11.
</P>
<P>
The Moroccan government says more than 1,100 soldiers captured by the
Polisario Front during clashes in the Western Sahara between 1975 --
when the disputed territory was annexed by Morocco on gaining
independence from Spain -- and the early 1980s are still detained by
the politico-guerrilla movement.
</P>
<P>
The men repatriated Wednesday by the International Committee of the
Red Cross were freed by Polisario, which has proclaimed a Sahrawi Arab
Democratic Republic (SADR) in the disputed territory, after
intervention by Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar.
</P>
<P>
A Moroccan newspaper close to the government, Le Matin, dismissed the
Polisario announcement as "political marketing" and "cynical
blackmail".
</P>
<P>
The PoWs still in Polisario hands are in sprawling prisoner of war
camps in the Tindouf region of Algeria, across the border from the
disputed territory, where the United Nations has for more than a
decade run up against obstacles from either side to its efforts to
organise a referendum on self-determination.
</P>
<P>
In January 2002, the Polisario Front freed 115 Moroccan troops
following intervention by Aznar, and five months later another 101 men
were released after similar moves by German secretary of state for
foreign affairs Juergen Chrobog.
