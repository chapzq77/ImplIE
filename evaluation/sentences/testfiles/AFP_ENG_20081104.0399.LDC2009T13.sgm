British PM says Gulf to unveil IMF boost at G20 summit
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
British Prime Minister Gordon Brown said on Tuesday he believed
Gulf states would announce extra money for an IMF bailout fund at
this month's G20 summit in Washington on the world financial
crisis.
</P>
<P>
Brown is on the last day of a tour of Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the
United Arab Emirates trying to persuade the energy rich region to
top up the International Monetary Fund's 250 billion dollar
emergency bailout pot.
</P>
<P>
The British premier says hundreds of billions of extra dollars
are needed to stop financial "contagion" spreading. The IMF is
already bailing out Iceland, Ukraine and Hungary.
</P>
<P>
"When we come to Washington... I believe we will see countries
coming together to make their statements about what they can
contribute," he told reporters in Dubai.
</P>
<P>
"There's been a positive response but it's not my job to announce
funds, it's a matter for the IMF when they talk to the individual
countries."
</P>
<P>
The G20, which includes both Britain and Saudi Arabia, is meeting
in Washington on November 15 for crunch talks on the crisis and
will also discuss reforming international institutions like the
IMF.
</P>
<P>
Brown met Dubai's ruler, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashed al-Maktoum,
who is also vice president and prime minister of the United Arab
Emirates, on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Since he arrived in the Gulf on Saturday, Brown has met Saudi
Arabia's King Abdullah -- who will attend the G20 meeting,
Qatar's Prime Minister Sheikh Hamad bin Jassem bin Jabr al-Thani
and Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan.
</P>
<P>
Lord Peter Mandelson, the British Business Secretary and former
EU commissioner who is travelling with Brown, told BBC radio that
Gulf states would give money to help out other nations.
</P>
<P>
"The Gulf is open to business but they're also signing up as keen
partners to help the rest of the world to get through the
international financial crisis," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Specifically, it means that they will contribute to the IMF
fund... but they will also contibute as partners to the decision-
making that we need to make to build up the institutions, the new
practices.
</P>
<P>
Mandelson said Brown was "worth his weight in gold" in
negotiations with international partners in securing fresh
business worth over 500 million pounds (about 790 million US
dollars/620 million euros) during the trip.
</P>
<P>
Brown, the former British finance minister whose struggling
premiership has been boosted by his handling of the financial
crisis, also wants China to give extra.
</P>
<P>
He says he supports an expanded role in the IMF for countries
which contribute to an extended fund. Experts say Gulf states
perceive the IMF as being dominated by the United States and
other leading industrialised nations in the G7.
</P>
<P>
Brown has also stressed the "central" role to be played in the
crisis by the next US president as Americans went to the polls to
choose between Democrat Barack Obama and Republican John McCain.
</P>
<P>
This role would include boosting the world economy, working "to
defeat protectionism in favour of free trade" and moving towards
Middle East peace.
</P>
<P>
Brown said on Tuesday he would work with whoever won the White
House.
</P>
<P>
During his tour, Brown has also called for more stability in the
oil market, despite opposition to calls for lower prices from the
Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, of which Saudi
Arabia, Qatar and UAE are all members.
</P>
<P>
The Qatari premier said he wanted to cooperate with the
international community on the financial crisis, while other
nations visited by Brown have not spoken publicly about the
outcome of the talks.
