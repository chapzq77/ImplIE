NEW YORK 2007-02-28 15:18:10 UTC
</P>
<P>
Stocks fluctuated in a narrow range Wednesday, showing some signs
of stability on a satisfactory gross domestic product report and
a recovery on some markets in other countries.
</P>
<P>
The major indexes opened higher and showed tepid resolve as the
market sought to regain its footing a day after the Dow Jones
industrials plunged 416 points amid growing concerns about
slowing economies in the U.S. and China. Investors were trying to
digest a batch of economic data that came out in the opening
minutes of trading.
</P>
<P>
The National Association of Purchasing Management-Chicago index
of business conditions in the Midwest showed a weaker-than-
expected reading. The February figure fell to 47.9 from 48.8 in
January. The report is often viewed as a bellwether for the
Institute for Supply Management's index of manufacturing activity
for February, which is due Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Also, a Commerce Department report found new-home sales fell by
16.6 percent in January from the previous month, the largest drop
in 13 years.
</P>
<P>
The market took some solace from the Commerce Department's report
that the GDP rose at an annual rate of 2.2 percent in the fourth
quarter. The figure was slightly below expectations, but not
enough to puncture Wednesday's nascent recovery.
</P>
<P>
Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke planned to testify on
Capitol Hill that early action must be taken to overhaul the
government's big benefit programs. Prepared remarks didn't
address the market's decline Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Dow was up 12.50, or 0.10 percent, at 12,228.74.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Standard &amp; Poor's
500 index was up 2.60, or 0.19 percent, at 1,401.64, and the
Nasdaq composite index was off 4.25 percent, or 0.18 percent, at
2,403.61.
</P>
<P>
Bonds fell, with the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note
rising to 4.54 percent from its low for the year of 4.47 percent
late Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The dollar was little changed against other major currencies,
while gold prices fell.
</P>
<P>
In markets abroad, the Shanghai stock market, whose nearly 9
percent skid Tuesday started a global selloff, rose nearly 4
percent, helping to steady trading in the U.S.
