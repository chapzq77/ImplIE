PHNOM PENH, Oct. 8 (Xinhua)
</P>
<P>
The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)
Wednesday started a three- day workshop on avian influenza
research activities in Cambodia, said a FAO press release.
</P>
<P>
The workshop took place in Sihanoukville with support from the
Cambodian Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries with
the aim of bringing together researchers from various disciplines
to share the results of their HPAI H5N1-related research in
Cambodia, said the release.
</P>
<P>
It also aimed to facilitate dynamic exchange of views between
researchers and decision makers on epidemiological, social and
economic issues relevant to HPAI H5N1 in Cambodia, according to
the release.
</P>
<P>
It still aimed to identify and prioritize major knowledge gaps
that research needs to fill and how to best address them in the
near future and contribute to the development of a second
generation of science-based HPAI H5N1 risk management strategies
that carefully consider their impacts on the livelihoods of the
poor, the release added.
</P>
<P>
Compared to neighboring Thailand and Vietnam, Cambodia was only
mildly affected by HPAI. Nevertheless, Cambodia's animal and
public health authorities heavily engaged in HPAI H5N1 control
and monitoring, and many of the implemented measures are still in
place, said the release.
</P>
<P>
Alongside these control measures, a wide array of field and
laboratory research was initiated in Cambodia, both by national
and international agencies, it said.
</P>
<P>
As much of this research is reaching completion or has been
completed and as the HPAI H5N1 control paradigm is shifting from
emergency reaction to longer term disease management, it is
timely to collate, review and synthesize research carried out in
Cambodia on various aspects of HPAI to inform policymaking,
investment and further research, it added.
