RugbyU: Six Nations set for fresh surprises
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Six Nations, rugby union's most consistently inconsistent
major tournament, swings into action next weekend with picking a
winner in the latest edition of the 125-year-old Championship
promising to be an especially difficult task.
</P>
<P>
European rugby finds itself in a much better state than the one
forceast by many pundits who predicted the Tri-Nations would
dominate the World Cup only to see both Australia and New Zealand
fail to reach the last four.
</P>
<P>
Although there was a southern hemipshere winner in South Africa,
England recovered from a dreadful run of results to reach the
final.
</P>
<P>
Hosts France had a nervy run to the last four while Ireland and
Wales both disappointed their followers in not reaching the
quarter-finals - something achieved by Scotland at Italy's
expense.
</P>
<P>
But just as advertisements for enticing financial products warn
in the small print that past performance is no indicator of
future success, so using recent form is rarely a reliable guide
to potential placings in the Six Nations.
</P>
<P>
This year's edition has been given a fresh element of uncertainty
by the appointment of three new coaches - Nick Mallett (Italy),
Marc Lievremont (France) and Warren Gatland (Wales) who in turn
have selected three new captains in Sergio Parisse, Lionel Nallet
and Ryan Jones respectively.
</P>
<P>
Gatland's arrival as coach of Wales will throw-up several
intriguing sub-plots.
</P>
<P>
The New Zealander will go head to head with both his predecessor
as his Ireland boss, Brian Ashton, now England's coach, in his
first match in charge of his new side and later in the tournament
will take on Ireland successor Eddie O'Sullivan.
</P>
<P>
"I understand the Six Nations as a tournament," said Gatland, the
latest Kiwi to coach Wales after Graham Henry and Steve Hansen.
</P>
<P>
"Some of the Kiwis or Aussies when they first come here they
don't understand it's not just a game of rugby. The Six Nations
is an event.
</P>
<P>
"There's so much more involved, it's the build-up of two or three
days and (for fans) the celebrating and partying before and
after."
</P>
<P>
England may be the team the others love to beat but two third and
fourth place finishes in the four years since a Grand Slam
heralded their World Cup triumph in 2003 are well bellow
expectations and now Ashton's task is to make his side well worth
beating once again.
</P>
<P>
Not that he was prepared to tip his side or anyone else's as
favourites.
</P>
<P>
"You can't predict a winner," Ashton said. "There is always an
unpredictability about the Six Nations but this year, with three
new coaches, there is an uncertainty too."
</P>
<P>
Wales will be looking for their first win at Twickenham in 20
years when the tournament begins on February 2 while Mallett's
men are away to Ireland.
</P>
<P>
A day later Six Nations champions France, bidding to avoid a
repeat of their shock defeat of two years ago, face Scotland at
Murrayfield.
</P>
<P>
Last season saw Italy achieve their best Six Nations placing of
fourth and Mallett, who led his native South Africa to a record-
equalling 17 straight Test wins, said: "Italy have the potential
up front to really dominate teams but I want to see them be more
ruthless."
</P>
<P>
Educated at England's Oxford University and having coached French
giants Stade Francais, Mallett is familiar with the Six Nations'
distinctive charms.
</P>
<P>
"It's a fantastic competition. Paris is a fantastic destination
and Rome is probably the best destination. Watching rugby in a
fantastic stadium (the Stadio Flaminio) which is packed, it's
like a bull-fighting arena, it's just wonderful," he enthused.
</P>
<P>
"The Six Nations has got atmosphere to beat any other
competition," Mallett added. "The Tri-Nations is a very high
standard of rugby but it's quite repetitive. Often in the Six
Nations there are results you don't expect."
