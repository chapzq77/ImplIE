OSCE calls on Georgia, Russia to head back to negotiation table
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe on
Thursday expressed concern over Russia's move to increase ties
with two rebel regions of Georgia, calling on all parties to
continue negotiations."I encourage the parties to the Georgian-
Ossetian conflict to return to the negotiating table in the
format agreed by all parties," Foreign Minister Alexander Stubb
of Finland, which holds the OSCE presidency, said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Stubb emphasised the OSCE's support for the "sovereignty and
territorial integrity of Georgia within its internationally
recognised borders."
</P>
<P>
"I urge all parties involved to refrain from any unilateral
actions which could further destabilise the already tense
situation," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I call on the parties to look for ways to build confidence and
engage in efforts to find a peaceful solution to the conflicts,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
Stubb's comments came after Russia on Wednesday said it would
intensify cooperation with the pro-Moscow breakaway Georgian
regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia.
</P>
<P>
The move provoked a call from Georgia on Thursday for an
extraordinary session of the UN Security Council and has prompted
expressions of concern from the European Union and NATO.
</P>
<P>
Swedish Foreign Minister Carl Bildt also expressed "deep concern"
on Thursday over the Russian move.
</P>
<P>
"Georgia's territorial integrity is part of the stability in the
larger Caucasian region where not least Russia should be very
interested in stability," Bildt said in a statement, warning that
"breaking this territorial integrity ... could have serious
consequences."
</P>
<P>
Abkhazia and South Ossetia broke away from Georgian control
during wars in the 1990s following the country's independence,
after the collapse of the Soviet Union.
