Tuncay Sanli and Semih Senturk scored second-half goals Saturday
to give Turkey a 2-0 win at Armenia in World Cup qualifying.
</P>
<P>
Tuncay gave the visitors the lead in the 61st minute, scoring
from close range. Senturk made it 2-0 in the 79th, capitalizing
on a defender's mistake in the box.
</P>
<P>
Mehmet Aurelio had an early chance for Turkey but his powerful
shot from 14 meters (yards) four minutes into the game was
blocked by goalkeeper Roman Berezovsky.
</P>
<P>
Armenia replied with a chance in the 8th when Volkan Demirel
saved Gamlet Mkhitarian's drive from 25 meters.
</P>
<P>
Neither side dominated the game before halftime, but Turkey
looked more organized.
</P>
<P>
The visitors came close midway through the first half when Emre
Delozoglu shaved the crossbar from the edge of the box in the
27th minute. Three minutes later, Mevlut Erdins broke down the
left flank only to hit the outer side of the net.
</P>
<P>
The match was being played against the backdrop of decades of
animosity rooted in the WWI-era atrocities that began in 1915.
The two neighbors have no diplomatic ties. Turkey President
Abdullah Gul attended the match, becoming the first Turkish
leader to visit Armenia since the ex-Soviet nation declared
independence in 1991.

<P>
On Wednesday, Turkey hosts Belgium and Armenia is at European
champion Spain.
</P>
<P>
Bosnia-Herzegovina and Estonia are also in Group 5.
