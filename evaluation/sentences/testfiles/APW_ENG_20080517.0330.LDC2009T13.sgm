Huge swathes of farmland were destroyed by the earthquake in
central China, but the losses should not cause food shortages or
big price hikes nationally, a senior official said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The devastated province of Sichuan is an important growing region
for rice, wheat, corn and other crops, producing 6 percent of
China's grain.
</P>
<P>
Wei Chao'an, China's vice minister for agriculture, said the
earthquake destroyed more than 75,000 acres (30,000 hectares) of
farmland in the province.
</P>
<P>
"This disaster led to serious losses in agricultural production
in the affected areas, but the situation of agricultural
production across the whole country remains good," Wei told a
news conference. "Prices for agricultural goods, generally
speaking, will remain stable. We have full confidence in this."
</P>
<P>
Wei said there was enough food to supply the market and affected
areas. Authorities have arranged special shipments of fuel, grain
and edible oil to prevent shortages.
</P>
<P>
Consumer prices have jumped across China since mid-2007, driven
by rises in food costs that hit 22.1 percent in April. The
government has been trying to cool hikes for pork, grain and
other items by increasing supplies and has imposed controls on
some basic goods.
</P>
<P>
China's economic planning agency set temporary price caps on
basic goods and transport in quake-hit areas to prevent price
gouging and hoarding.
</P>
<P>
The National Development and Reform Commission said Thursday it
will control prices for food, drinking water and transport in
central Sichuan and Gansu provinces because of rising prices
there.
