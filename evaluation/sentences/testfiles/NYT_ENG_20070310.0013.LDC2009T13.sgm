COURSE PLAYS TOUGH ENOUGH IN NEW SLOT
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PALM HARBOR Amid the congratulations that accompanied the
announcement more than a year ago that Tampa Bay's PGA Tour event
would be moving to the spring was plenty of concern.
</P>
<P>
The folks at Innisbrook are proud of the Copperhead course that
has been ranked among the state's best for three decades.
</P>
<P>
And they were a bit perturbed at the prospect of seeing the
world's best golfers take advantage of what many believed could
be a vulnerable layout.
</P>
<P>
So much for that.
</P>
<P>
Through two rounds of the PODS Championship, the Copperhead
course is every bit as difficult as it was in October. Perhaps
more so.
</P>
<P>
The lead through 36 holes was 6 under par exactly where it was
through one round, and two strokes higher than in October at the
halfway point of the $5.3-million tournament.
</P>
<P>
"It's kind of got a major (championship)-type feel," said Chris
DiMarco, whose 69 Friday put him two shots behind leader Stephen
Leaney. "And it's only going to get tougher."
</P>
<P>
Leaney's 4-under 67 matched the lowest score of the day and
included a 45-foot birdie putt on the 18th hole, which put him at
136, one stroke ahead of Heath Slocum. Another shot back were
DiMarco, Pat Perez, Doug LaBelle, Vaughn Taylor, Daniel Chopra,
Jonathan Byrd and defending champion K.J. Choi.
</P>
<P>
Choi finished at 13 under in October, the only player to reach
double digits for the tournament.
</P>
<P>
First-round leader Cliff Kresge shot 74 and was tied for 10th,
three strokes back. Kresge got to 8 under through 11 holes
Thursday after the second of his two eagles and nobody has gotten
close to that number since. He bogeyed two holes coming in and
kept his lead all morning as players fired and missed.
</P>
<P>
"I did not consider that the fairways would be slow,"
Innisbrook's director of golf, Jay Overton, said. "The rye grass
has kept them slower and made the ball stop rolling so much. Some
players have told me they're hitting much longer shots to the
greens than in the fall."
</P>
<P>
Since October, the resort initiated its typical overseeding
program with a rye grass meant to keep the place looking green
when the Bermuda grass went dormant. Overton, among others,
figured it would perhaps make the course play easier, because the
rough would not be as thick. But with some cleverly tucked pins
and fast greens, Copperhead remains a strong challenge.
</P>
<P>
Imagine if the wind blew or temperatures dropped. Friday's round
was played under sunny skies with barely a breeze and yet the
average was still 72.421. And just 24 of the 141 left in the
field shot in the 60s.
</P>
<P>
"The course is defending itself very well," said Ryan Moore, who
moved into contention but bogeyed his final three holes to finish
at 2 under. "It's a tough golf course. If you hit it in the wrong
spot, you're going to make some bogeys. You have to be careful."
</P>
<P>
Moore was not the only player to struggle coming in. Vijay Singh,
who won in 2004, was a shot out of the lead when he bogeyed three
of his last four holes to join Moore in 14th.
</P>
<P>
There were 77 players who made the 36-hole cut, which came at
144, 2 over par.
</P>
<P>
Leaney, who celebrates his 38th birthday today, is an Australian
whose best finish on the PGA Tour was a second to Jim Furyk at
the 2003 U.S. Open. He does have seven international victories,
three in Australia and four on the European tour, the last coming
in 2002.
</P>
<P>
"The golf course wears you out," Leaney said. "There are no easy
holes. There are no holes apart from the first and the 11th (par
5s) where you really feel like you've got great birdie chances.
You've just got to put it in play, pick your moments. The only
difference is this week I've been making putts, and that's the
only way to get to 6 under, is to hole your fair share."
</P>
<P>
With another nice day in the forecast, there remains the
possibility that somebody could go low. Kresge was on track for a
time Thursday and there are certainly enough players with the
capability.
</P>
<P>
But nobody is betting on it.
</P>
<P>
"The greens are as fast as we've putted on all year," DiMarco
said. "And they are very undulated. If you saw some of the pins
out there, they are really tough to get close to. So it's just
tough. It's just a good, hard golf course."
