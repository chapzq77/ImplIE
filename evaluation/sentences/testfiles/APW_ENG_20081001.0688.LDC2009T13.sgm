US ' casino '  mentality blamed for planet ' s meltdown

<P>
Astounded by the U.S. government's failure to resolve the
financial crisis threatening the foundations of the global free
market, fingers of blame are pointing at America from around the
planet.
</P>
<P>
National leaders and ordinary people say the U.S. must quickly
fix the financial crisis it created before the rest of the
world's hard-won economic gains are lost.
</P>
<P>
"The managers of big business took huge risks out of greed," said
President Oscar Arias of Costa Rica, whose economy is highly
dependent on U.S. trade. "What happens in the United States will
affect the entire world and, above all, small countries like
ours."
</P>
<P>
In Europe, where some blame a phenomenon of "casino capitalism"
that has become deeply engrained from New York to London to
Moscow, there is more of a sense of shared responsibility. But
Europeans also blame the U.S. government for letting things get
out of hand.
</P>
<P>
"I have to do with this situation all the time," said Norbert
Weigel, a merchant banker smoking a cigarette near Frankfurt's
main station Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
"Surely the Americans are to blame. Investment bankers made
investments on products where they didn't understand the risk and
were trying to make fast profits."
</P>
<P>
Mezat Oyena, a native of southwestern Turkey who owns a
barbershop in Berlin's central Mitte neighborhood, blames the
crisis for a dropoff in his business.
</P>
<P>
"A financial crisis in America, we all feel that," he said.
"America makes this big problem and won't fix it even as it's
getting worse. From now on they will need to divide the load,
American can't be the only one at the top of the system any
more."
</P>
<P>
Amid harsh criticism is a growing consensus that stricter
financial regulation is needed to prevent unfettered capitalism
from destroying economies around the globe.
</P>
<P>
Especially, leaders of developing nations that kept spending
tight and opened their economies in response to American demands
are warning of other consequences -- a loss of U.S. influence
globally and the likelihood that the world's poor will suffer the
most from greed by the biggest players in global finance.
</P>
<P>
"They spent the last three decades saying we needed to do our
chores. They didn't," a grim-faced Brazilian President Luiz
Inacio Lula da Silva said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Even staunch U.S. allies like Colombian President Alvaro Uribe
blasted the world's most powerful country for egging on
uncontrolled financial speculation that he compared to a wild
horse with no reins.
</P>
<P>
"The whole world has financed the United States, and I believe
that they have a reciprocal debt with the planet," he said.
</P>
<P>
It's harder for European leaders to point the finger directly at
the United States since many of their financiers participated in
the recklessness. London was home to the division of failed
insurer AIG that racked up huge losses on credit-default swaps,
and many reputable European banks disregarded risk to load up on
higher yielding subprime assets.
</P>
<P>
But the House's rejection Monday of the U.S. bank bailout
proposed by Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson provoked a sharper
tone and warnings that America must act. Though global markets on
Tuesday recovered some of the ground they lost in a worldwide
slide the day before, politicians from Europe to South America
insisted the risk of a further plunge remains high.
</P>
<P>
German Chancellor Angela Merkel called on U.S. lawmakers to pass
a package this week, saying it was the "precondition for creating
new confidence on the markets -- and that is of incredibly great
significance."
</P>
<P>
In an unusually blunt statement from the 27-country European
Union, EU Commission spokesman Johannes Laitenberger said: "The
United States must take its responsibility in this situation,
must show statesmanship for the sake of their own country, and
for the sake of the world."
</P>
<P>
The crisis also has strengthened voices in France and Germany
calling for EU regulations to eliminate highly deregulated
financial markets, despite objections from Britain, which along
with the U.S. is considered by some to practice a freer form of
"Anglo-Saxon" capitalism.
</P>
<P>
"This crisis underlines the excesses and uncertainties of a
casino capitalism that has only one logic -- lining your
pockets," said German lawmaker Martin Schulz, chairman of the
Socialists in the EU assembly. "It also shows the bankruptcy of
'law of the jungle' capitalism that no longer invests in
companies and job creation, but instead makes money out of money
in a totally uncontrolled way."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government's failure to apply rules that might have
prevented the crisis is seen as a betrayal in many developing
countries that faced intense U.S. pressures to liberalize their
economies. In some developing nations, state enterprises were
privatized, currencies were allowed to float against the U.S.
dollar and painful measures were taken to bring down debts.
</P>
<P>
These advances are at risk now that credit is drying up.
Countries with commodities-based economies are particularly
vulnerable since more industrialized nations could reduce their
demand for everything from soy to iron ore.
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't seem fair to me that those of us who endured so much
hunger in the 20th century, who began to improve in the 21st
century, should have to suffer due to the international financial
system," Silva said. "There are going to be a lot of people going
hungry in the world."
</P>
<P>
Just before meeting with Silva on Tuesday, Venezuelan leader Hugo
Chavez said he believes a new economic order is in store for the
planet.
</P>
<P>
"What's to blame? Imperialism, the United States, the
irresponsibility of the United States government," said the self-
avowed socialist and frequent U.S. critic. "From this crisis, a
new world has to emerge, and it's a multi-polar world."
</P>
<P>
China's influence in the outcome of all this could be profound
because it is a huge investor in U.S. debt. It is already calling
for strict new international regulatory systems to apply to
globalized financial markets.
</P>
<P>
Liu Mingkang, chairman of the Chinese Banking Regulatory
Commission, said Saturday before a weeklong bank holiday in China
that debt in the United States and elsewhere has risen to
dangerous and indefensible levels.
</P>
<P>
The rest of the world is taking notice. Many newspapers made
references Tuesday to China's increasing importance in global
finance. In Algeria, a large cartoon on the front page of the
newspaper El-Watan showed Uncle Sam at prayer: "Save us!" he
says, kneeling before a portrait of China's Mao Zedong.
</P>
<P>
In London, Jane Ayerson, a 20-year-old Irish exchange student,
said Europeans share the blame.
</P>
<P>
"The problem started with America, but banks here have been
greedy, too," she said.
</P>
