SPORTS COLUMN: COUGHLIN WRITES HIS OWN MATERIAL

GLENDALE, Ariz.
</P>
<P>
One hour with reporters, or the amount of action minutes it takes
to complete an entire football game, would seem to be the worst
of tortures for Bill Belichick and Tom Coughlin, even on Super
Bowl media day, the annual orgy of talking and league-mandated
tolerance.
</P>
<P>
As Coughlin said after mounting a small stage here Tuesday,
waiting for the clock to run on his imagined punishment for
leading his upstart Giants here to challenge Belichick's still-
perfect Patriots, "I don't want to get this going one second
faster than I have to."
</P>
<P>
When he finally sat down, he compared himself to the guy on the
carnival hot seat, waiting to be dunked in the water. But he got
a laugh on that one, and before we knew it, the erstwhile
contrarian and longtime curmudgeon was an engaging, wise-
cracking, media-day star, and not solely measured against the
low-bar standard set by Belichick earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
How do you not gain new-found respect for a professional football
coach who takes a moment on the national stage to make fun of his
own anatomical imperfection?
</P>
<P>
"Anybody with ears like these ought to cover them up," Coughlin
said, having learned the hard way by briefly exposing them to the
frigid Green Bay conditions two Sundays ago.
</P>
<P>
Reporters came and went and were immediately replaced by more
quotation-hungry masses with little in the way of anything new to
ask. To Coughlin's right, the digital clock on the scoreboard at
the University of Phoenix Stadium, visible to him with a mere
peripheral glance, began to slowly wind down.
</P>
<P>
Tick tick tick. Who would be the poor, unsuspecting soul to make
Coughlin bristle, if not frustrated and red-faced?
</P>
<P>
"I should have had statements printed up, handed them out,"
Coughlin said when asked, a third time, about the accrued
benefits of standing up to the challenge of the Patriots in the
final game of the regular season.He answered the question,
though, and the longer he continued, the more he didn't seem to
mind the repetition, no more than he would making his receivers
re-run practice routes. Here at the first Super Bowl of his head-
coaching career, with a handsome contract extension to come,
Coughlin was a man on a mission to make a few friends.
</P>
<P>
Other responses were caustic, but almost endearingly so. When
someone began a question by calling him conservative, Coughlin
said: "Me? How can you say that? You're taking a wild stab
there."
</P>
<P>
But he also became emotional when he spoke of his Jay Fund
Foundation, which he created in the name of Jay McGillis, a
former player of Coughlin's at Boston College who died of
leukemia. He bought into media day silliness, playfully
responding when 10-year-old Jason Krause of Chicago, armed with
an ESPN credential and mic, stepped up to congratulate him on
"being nicer" this season.
</P>
<P>
"Tom Coughlin is relaxed, he's upbeat, he's fun. I haven't seen
him like this in a long time," Steve Mariucci, the former 49ers
and Lions coach, told his NFL Network audience to the side of the
stage. Mariucci soon lured Coughlin into an animated discussion
of the West Coast offense Mariucci once gave him a few pointers
on.
</P>
<P>
A question about the leadership council of players Coughlin
created this season initiated a heartfelt monologue about his
improved communication this season, his determination that "the
players were not going to be uncomfortable because of me."
</P>
<P>
He talked about the more organic aspects of coaching years ago at
the Rochester Institute of Technology, about having a roster of
30 and being out lining the fields when his coaching counterpart
from the University of Albany pulled up for a game "with busloads
of players."
</P>
<P>
After arriving in Phoenix Monday night and declaring that he was
"not going to be reflective; that is not where I'm going,"
Coughlin went with the flow, embracing the most essential media
day tenet. He was an elaborator, a storyteller, a veritable
entertainer.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Belichick had a sound bite to remember, when
approached by a female reporter from Mexico's TV Azteca dressed
in a short wedding dress with white thigh-high stockings. She had
just offered herself in wedlock to Tom Brady.
</P>
<P>
"You think I am better than Gisele?" the reporter, standing on a
bench to provide Belichick an enhanced view, asked, referring to
Brady's supermodel girlfriend, Gisele Bundchen.
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't go that far," Belichick said in his seldom-modulated
monotone.
</P>
<P>
Nor would he go very far in trying to rise to the occasion of
media day. Granted, this is old hat now for Belichick, but before
spending an enjoyable hour with Coughlin, breaks were necessary
from Belichick's clipped, detached rhetoric. He might be the more
decorated coach, the deeper thinker, but he is also a permanently
closed book to those outside his inner circle. More passionate,
more easily provoked and therefore more human, Coughlin won the
personality contest between these reputably recalcitrant Super
Bowl coaches, hands down.
</P>
<P>
"You look like you enjoyed this," Coughlin was told after he had
kept talking, even after the clock had run out.
</P>
<P>
"I did," he said, unsmiling, almost scowling. But unquestionably
sincere.
