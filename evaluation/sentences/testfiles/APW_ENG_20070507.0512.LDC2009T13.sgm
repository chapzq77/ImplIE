Sri Lankan jets strike rebel targets as official acknowledges
truce is being violated

Sri Lankan jets pounded rebel positions Monday as the government
acknowledged a collapsing cease-fire had been repeatedly violated
by both sides and said the country's national security was more
important than the truce.
</P>
<P>
Hours after the latest attacks on rebel targets, a Nordic truce
monitoring mission said the Sri Lankan military had in recent
weeks upped the number of airstrikes and assaults on the northern
heartland of the Tamil Tiger rebels.
</P>
<P>
As violence has spiraled, both sides have insisted they are
abiding by the 2002 truce -- which remains officially in place --
and are only responding to the other's aggression.
</P>
<P>
But on Monday, government spokesman Keheliya Rambukwella
acknowledged the cease-fire "has been violated over and over
again" by both sides, and warned: "wherever national security is
threatened we will take appropriate action."
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the military said fighter jets bombed a rebel base and
training camp in Mullativu, a coastal town in the wide swath of
northern Sri Lanka controlled by the Tigers. Spokesman Brig.
Prasad Samarasinghe gave no casualty figures but said a large
number of rebels were at the base at the time.
</P>
<P>
There was no immediate response from the rebels to the government
or military statements, although the insurgents routinely dispute
official accounts of air strikes and clashes.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Nordic truce monitors said the air force has
increased airstrikes and spy plane activity over Tamil Tiger
rebel-held areas in the north.
</P>
<P>
Combat seems to have "shifted from the east to the areas closer
to Kilinochchi, the main rebel-held town in the north," the Sri
Lanka Monitoring Mission said in its weekly media statement.
</P>
<P>
It said there were up to eight airstrikes in northern rebel-held
areas in the week of April 23-29.
</P>
<P>
The government spokesman reacted angrily to the mission's
statement, saying it had no mandate to comment on a matter of Sri
Lankan national security.
</P>
<P>
The Tamil Tigers have fought since 1983 for an independent
homeland in the north and east for Sri Lanka's minority Tamils, a
largely Hindu ethnic group that has faced decades of
discrimination by the majority Sinhalese, who are predominantly
Buddhist.
</P>
<P>
The conflict killed at least 65,000 people before the 2002 cease-
fire. Air raids, bus bombings, suicide attacks and jungle clashes
have left an estimated 4,000 more dead since December 2005.
