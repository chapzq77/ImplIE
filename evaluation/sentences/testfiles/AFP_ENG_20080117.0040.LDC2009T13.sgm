Benfica midfielder Augustin Binya on Thursday lost his appeal
against a six- match suspension handed down for a red-card
offence in his team's Champions League clash with Celtic.
</P>
<P>
Binya was banned for a crunching tackle on Celtic's Scott Brown
in the Group D game in Glasgow in November and was sent off in
the 85th minute.

The 23-year-old then sat out the subsequent Champions League
games against AC Milan and Shakhtar Donetsk.
</P>
<P>
His remaining four-match suspension starts with Benfica's UEFA
Cup round of 32 clashes against Nuremberg in February.
