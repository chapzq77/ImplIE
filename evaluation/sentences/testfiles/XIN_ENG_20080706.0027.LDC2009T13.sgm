GAZA, July 6 (Xinhua)
</P>
<P>
Islamic Hamas movement on Sunday warned Israel against carrying
out any military action in the Gaza Strip in response to homemade
rockets from Gaza at Israel.
</P>
<P>
"Israel would be playing with fire in case it carries out any
military action against Gaza," said Sami Abu Zuhri, Hamas
spokesman in Gaza, adding "The occupation (Israel) should think
carefully before carrying out such an action."
</P>
<P>
Egypt brokered on June 19 a ceasefire between Israel and Gaza
militant groups, led by Hamas movement. Israel agreed to stop
military actions in Gaza and lifting blockade against Gaza in
exchange for the Palestinian militants stopping homemade rocket
attacks on Israel.
</P>
<P>
However, since June 19, the day the truce came into effect in
Gaza, three homemade rockets have been fired from Gaza at Israel,
for which the Islamic Jihad and Fatah armed wing claimed
responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
During the start of the ceasefire, Israel has opened Gaza
crossings only for eight days and kept the crossings closed
following the three separate homemade rocket attacks.
</P>
<P>
One of the truce conditions between Hamas and Israel is that
Israel eases a one- year blockade on the Strip and allows needed
goods and raw materials for construction and industry into the
enclave.
</P>
<P>
"So far, we don't see a real Israeli commitment to the truce. The
violations of the truce are still going on and the extent of
reopening of the crossings is much less than what was agreed
upon, " said Abu Zuhri.
