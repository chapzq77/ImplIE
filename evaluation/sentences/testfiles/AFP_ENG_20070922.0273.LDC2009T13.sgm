Football: Miller just in time for Sunderland
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Liam Miller snatched a point for Sunderland as Middlesbrough were
made to pay for failing to make more of the chances they
generated in an entertaining northeast derby clash.
</P>
<P>
Former Celtic and Manchester United midfielder Miller latched on
to a Kenwyne Jones header to volley in an equaliser a minute from
time after Boro had battled back from conceding an early goal to
lead through Stewart Downing's superb strike.
</P>
<P>
Sunderland need just over a minute to take the lead, Grant
Leadbitter capitalising after former Black Cats midfielder Julio
Arca carelessly conceded possession on the half-way line.
</P>
<P>
Midfielder Leadbitter surged forward and fed Michael Chopra
before continuing his run to collect the forward's drive into the
box, steady himself and slot the ball past Mark Schwarzer in the
Boro goal.
</P>
<P>
The shock of going behind so early in the contest appeared to
galvanise Boro and their offensive efforts were rewarded after
quarter of an hour when Arca made amends for his earlier error by
equalising.
</P>
<P>
Debutant Gary O'Neil floated in a cross from the right and the
Argentinian rose to met it with an emphatic header that left
Sunderland's Scotland goalkeeper Craig Gordon with no chance.
</P>
<P>
That proved to be Arca's last significant contribution to the
contest as he was stretchered off shortly afterwards.
</P>
<P>
Boro had already lost Turkish striker Tuncay Sanli to injury but
they nevertheless continued to pose the greater attacking threat.
</P>
<P>
Fabio Rochemback struck a shot inches wide with Gordon apparently
beaten and referee Howard Webb enraged the home supporters when
he failed to point to the spot after Danny Higginbotham
apparently handled Luke Young's ball into the box.
</P>
<P>
O'Neil then had a chance to mark his debut with a goal but he
volleyed over the bar from close range after Downing's shot had
been deflected into his path.
</P>
<P>
Boro finally took the lead in the 66th minute, Downing cutting in
from the left before striking a superb shot with his right from
outside the area.
</P>
<P>
That looked virtually certain to wrap up the points for the home
side but Miller had other ideas.
