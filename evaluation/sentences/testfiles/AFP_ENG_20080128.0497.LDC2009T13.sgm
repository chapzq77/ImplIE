Thailand rejects EU complaints on alcohol imports
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thailand is ready to discuss its pricing policy for alcohol
imports from the EU, but rejected a European complaint that its
system was "arbitrary," a top customs official said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The European Union has made the first step with the World Trade
Organisation towards a formal complaint over Thailand's pricing
for EU alcohol imports, accusing the kingdom of ignoring the
declared value of the products.
</P>
<P>
EU Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson said in a statement that
the policy was "arbitrary and damaging for EU companies seeking
to do business in Thailand."
</P>
<P>
Natina Santiyanont, head of Thailand's Customs Procedures and
Valuation Directorate, said the kingdom was ready to meet with
the Europeans to explain their policy.
</P>
<P>
She said that values on products were only changed if companies
failed to prove that their pricing was accurate.
</P>
<P>
"We have standards to maintain and to facilitate importers that
are honest and comply with rules and regulations," she said.
</P>
<P>
"Our pricing policy is based on the transaction value of the
imported goods... That is in line with the WTO and recognised by
Thai laws," she said.
</P>
<P>
Natina said the customs department would meet with EU
representatives within a few days.
</P>
<P>
The EU lodged the request on Friday. If talks between the two
sides do not resolve the issue within 60 days, the EU will be
able to ask the WTO to rule on the legality of the Thai measures.
</P>
<P>
Brussels registered a similar complaint in November at the WTO
against India so as to secure a change in practices that blocked
access to the Indian market for European wine and spirits
producers.
