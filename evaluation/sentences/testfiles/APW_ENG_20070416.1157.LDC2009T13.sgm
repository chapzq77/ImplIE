Fired Dow Chemical adviser denies involvement in takeover effort

J. Pedro Reinhard, a senior adviser whom Dow Chemical Co. fired
last week along with a company officer, said Monday he was not
involved in any clandestine effort to take over the company, the
reason given by Dow Chemical for their dismissal.
</P>
<P>
"I categorically deny that I have been part of any secret effort
to take over or acquire Dow Chemical," Reinhard said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
Andrew Liveris, the company's chairman and chief executive
officer, said Thursday that Reinhard, who retired as the Midland,
Michigan-based chemical giant's chief financial officer in
October 2005, and Romeo Kreinberg, a divisional executive vice
president, were dismissed with the approval of the board of
directors.
</P>
<P>
Reinhard, a 37-year veteran of the company, remains a member of
the board because only shareholders, not management, can remove
directors.
</P>
<P>
Dow Chemical's board took a step Monday toward having Reinhard
removed from that body. The directors revised their slate of
approved nominees for board election that will be presented May
10 at the annual shareholders meeting in Midland, Michigan, and
Reinhard was the only one of the 12 directors who was not
approved for re-election.
</P>
<P>
The board also reduced its size to 11 members, to take effect at
the time of the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Kreinberg said Thursday there was no truth to the accusations
made against him.
</P>
<P>
Both he and Reinhard said they were exploring their legal
options.
</P>
<P>
"I have always faithfully complied with my fiduciary duties to
Dow," Reinhard said. "My conscience is clear."
</P>
<P>
On April 8, The Sunday Express, a British tabloid, reported that
a group of Middle Eastern investors and U.S. buyout firms was
preparing a bid for Dow Chemical, which makes and sells
chemicals, plastics and farm products to customers in a range of
industries.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper first reported in January that several private
equity firms were interested in Dow Chemical.
