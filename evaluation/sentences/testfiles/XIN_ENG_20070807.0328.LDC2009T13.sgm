S. Africa, FIFA agree on dual-name system for 2010 World Cup

JOHANNESBURG, August 7 (Xinhua)
</P>
<P>
World soccer governing body FIFA and South Africa on Tuesday
agreed to internationally use a dual-name system for three 2010
World Cup host cities in the country.
</P>
<P>
This compromise was reached amid South Africa's controversial
name-changing campaigns, with objectors warning that new names of
the host cities could cause unnecessary confusion
internationally.
</P>
<P>
FIFA and the 2010 Local Organizing Committee (LOC) agreed that
the three host cities would be internationally known as
Pretoria/Tshwane, Bloemfontein/Mangaung and Port Elizabeth/Nelson
Mandela Bay, state broadcaster SABC reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The double-barrel names will also be printed on the tickets of
the 2010 matches, according to the decision made after the
monthly 2010 board meeting in Johannesburg.
</P>
<P>
But within South Africa, the cities will only be known as
Tshwane, Mangaung and the Nelson Mandela Bay municipality, SABC
said.
</P>
<P>
Decision has yet been made on whether Nelspruit, another host
city, will be called Mbombela.
</P>
<P>
South Africa's black government has for years advocated the
campaign to change names of hundreds of streets and cities, which
were considered as legacies of the country's colonial past.
</P>
<P>
Pretoria, the South African capital that was named after Boer
settler and Afrikaner hero Andries Pretorius, has been proposed
to be renamed Tshwane, the name of a pre-colonial local chief,
which means "we are the same".
</P>
<P>
Supporters of the change say the switch will underscore South
Africa's break with apartheid in 1994.
</P>
<P>
But objectors, predominantly white people of Afrikaner origin,
said they had a feeling of being alienated in new South Africa,
and many feel that the enormous cost of the name change would be
better spent dealing with the country's high poverty rates and
current AIDS crisis.
</P>
<P>
The government has made it clear that the name change plan
retains " Pretoria" as part of the bigger Tshwane municipality.
</P>
<P>
Although many South African governmental organs and a few media,
including SABC, have started to refer Tshwane as the South
African capital, large amount of media, businesses and
institutions both in South Africa and internationally still use
Pretoria as the city's name.
</P>
<P>
Last week, City of Tshwane spokesman Console Tleane confirmed
plans to change road signs from "Pretoria" to "Tshwane" or "City
of Tshwane".
