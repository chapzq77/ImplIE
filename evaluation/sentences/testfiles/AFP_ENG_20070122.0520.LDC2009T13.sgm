Basic in-stink: Sharon Stone top of the flops in Oscars spoofs by
Rob Woollard

<P>
Sharon Stone and "Basic Instinct 2" were top of the flops here
Monday as organisers of Hollywood's annual Oscars parody -- the
Razzies -- unveiled their nominations for 2006's "worst of the
worst".
</P>
<P>
The critically panned sequel to the 1992 psychological murder
mystery received seven Razzie nods, which come one day before the
official Oscars nominations are announced in Beverly Hills on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"Unenjoyable, unerotic, unwatchable," was how one reviewer summed
up Basic Instinct 2 last year, while another stuck the boot into
screen goddess Stone, opining that there "are inflatable toys
that are livelier."
</P>
<P>
"Basic Instinct 2" received nominations for worst picture,
actress, supporting actor, director, sequel, screenplay and
screen couple.
</P>
<P>
The only consolation that Stone and the movie's creators could
take from Monday's announcements was that they had a rival for
worst film of the year in the shape of "Little Man" by Wayans
brothers Keenen Ivory, Shawn and Marlon.
</P>
<P>
The slapstick comedy was derided by one reviewer as being "one-
joke short of a one-joke movie", was described by the Golden
Raspberry Award Foundation as being a "blatant knock-off of a
1954 Bugs Bunny cartoon".
</P>
<P>
"Little Man" joined "Basic Instinct 2" at the head of the roll of
dis-honor with seven nominations -- worst picture, actor (2),
remake/rip-off, director, screenplay and screen couple.
</P>
<P>
Other movies vying for the worst picture accolade that no-one
wants to win are M. Night Shyamalan's "Lady in the Water", the
remake of Australian thriller "Wicker Man" starring Nicolas Cage
and Uwe Boll's "Bloodrayne".
</P>
<P>
Internet users consider Boll "the worst director alive today",
the Razzies organisers noted in a press release.
</P>
<P>
Cage will be among the nominees for worst actor of 2006, which
also include last year's winner Rob Schneider for "Benchwarmers"
and TV funnyman Tim Allen for a trio of "terrible" films: "Santa
Clause 3", "Shaggy Dog" and "Zoom."
</P>
<P>
In the worst actress category, Stone faces competition from two
of Hollywood's rising starlets, Jessica Simpson and Lindsay
Lohan.
</P>
<P>
Simpson has been nominated for "Employee of the Month", while
Lohan, who last week entered a rehabilitation centre, received a
nod for "Just My Luck", dismissed by prominent critic Richard
Roeper as "a real piece of junk".
</P>
<P>
Several other well-known names were amongst the nominees for
worst supporting actor and actress.
</P>
<P>
Oscar-winner Ben Kingsley and Danny DeVito are on the shortlist
for worst supporting actor.
</P>
<P>
Nominees for worst supporting actress include perennial Razzies
candidates Jenny McCarthy and Carmen Electra, along with "Lost"
star Michelle Rodriguez and Kate Bosworth for an "ultra-lame"
portrayl of Lois Lane in "Superman Returns", Razzies organisers
said.
</P>
<P>
The winners of the un-coveted Razzies, which were created in
1980, will be announced at an awards ceremony in Hollywood on
February 24, a day ahead of the Academy Awards.
</P>
<P>
Recipients of the Razzies rarely show up to collect their prizes,
gold spray- painted plastic gongs in the shape of a raspberry,
which organisers say are worth as much as 4.97 dollars.
