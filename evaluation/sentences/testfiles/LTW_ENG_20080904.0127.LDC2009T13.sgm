U.S. Troops Entered Pakistan, Officials Say
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Helicopters carried U.S. and Afghan commandos many miles into
Pakistan on Wednesday to stage the first U.S. ground attack
against a Taliban target inside the country, Pakistani officials
said Wednesday. At least 20 local people died in the raid,
according to the officials.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan filed a formal protest with the U.S. government, which
had no comment on what appeared to be a new escalation of U.S.
pressure on Taliban and al-Qaida sanctuaries in Pakistan's
mountainous border regions.
</P>
<P>
As the Taliban insurgency escalates in Afghanistan, U.S.
officials have increasingly turned their attention to those
havens. Pakistan has committed to securing the borders, but has
been beset with rising violence, both in the frontier region and
in its cities.
</P>
<P>
In another example of eroding security, the limousine of
Pakistani Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gillani was ambushed
Wednesday in the capital, Islamabad. Two bullets struck the side
window of his black Mercedes Benz as it sped toward an airport.
Gillani was not in the vehicle at the time.
</P>
<P>
U.S. forces based in Afghanistan have periodically conducted air
and artillery strikes against insurgents across the border in
Pakistani territory and new hot-pursuit rules provide some room
for American troops to maneuver during battle. But the arrival of
U.S. helicopters in the village of Musa Nika, deep in undisputed
Pakistani territory, would constitute a new tactic.
</P>
<P>
Mohammed Sadiq, a spokesman for Pakistan's Foreign Ministry,
condemned a "gross violation of Pakistan's territory" and "a
grave provocation." In a written statement, he said his office
lodged a formal complaint with the U.S. Embassy in Islamabad.
</P>
<P>
"Such actions are counterproductive and certainly do not help our
joint efforts to fight terrorism," Sadiq said. "On the contrary,
they undermine the very basis of cooperation and may fuel the
fire of hatred and violence that we are trying to extinguish."
</P>
<P>
U.S. military officials in Afghanistan, at the Central Command in
Tampa and at the Pentagon maintained a wall of silence, saying
they had no comment on the Pakistani reports. Lou Fintor, a U.S.
Embassy spokesman in Islamabad, also declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
Pakistani sources gave varying accounts, including on the number
of troops and helicopters involved, and on whether U.S. troops
were among those who left the helicopters and conducted a ground
operation in the village. There were also differing versions of
how far inside Pakistan the helicopters flew, because the
border's location is disputed. By one count, the target village
lay about 20 miles from the border.
</P>
<P>
According to Pakistani military sources, the raid began about 3
a.m. Wednesday when two or possibly three U.S. Army helicopters
carrying American and Afghan troops landed in Musa Nika village
in the Pakistani tribal area of South Waziristan.
</P>
<P>
The raid was apparently in response to a rocket that fighters
fired at a convoy inside Afghanistan, according to one senior
Pakistani official. "By the time they got there," the official
said, "the guy with the rocket had moved."
</P>
<P>
According to another Pakistani official, who spoke on the
condition of anonymity because he is not authorized to give out
information, several of the troops left the helicopters and
launched an assault on three houses.
</P>
<P>
One of the homes belonged to local tribesman Pao Jan Ahmedzai
Wazir, according to Anwar Shah, a resident of a neighboring
village. Several women and children who were inside Wazir's house
and two other homes nearby were killed when U.S. and Afghan
troops fired on the buildings, he said. "The situation there is
very terrible. People are trying to take out the dead bodies,"
Shah said.
</P>
<P>
The reported attack comes at a time of debate over the rules of
military operation along the 1,500 mile border between
Afghanistan and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani military appears to have acceded to U.S. pressure
to step up attacks on extremists in its border areas. In the past
two months, it has launched major offensives on Taliban and al-
Qaida strongholds in two of the country's Federally Administered
Tribal Areas.
</P>
<P>
Analysts in Islamabad say that the incursion into South
Waziristan could augur a tactical turn aimed at cutting off an
insurgency that threatens to engulf large swaths of Pakistan and
reverse gains made by U.S. and NATO forces in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon has never acknowledged a case of hot pursuit into
Pakistan. Wednesday's incident "doesn't fit that bill," the
senior Pakistani official said. There was no indication U.S.
forces had begun a ground pursuit inside Afghanistan that led
them into Pakistani territory.
</P>
<P>
A Pakistani military liaison unit at the main U.S. military base
in Afghanistan, Bagram, is under military procedures to be
informed of any incursion. Pakistani officials insist there was
no such notification.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Adm. Michael Mullen, chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs
of Staff, held a meeting with the Pakistani army chief, Gen.
Ashfaq Kiyani, aboard a U.S. aircraft carrier in the Indian Ocean
after several serious setbacks for Western and Afghan forces in
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
U.S. and Pakistani officials have released few details about the
meeting, which was also attended by Gen. David McKiernan, NATO's
top commander in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
But a senior Pakistani military official with knowledge of the
meeting said that Mullen and Kiyani focused in large part on the
threat to international forces in Afghanistan emanating from
insurgents operating inside Pakistan's borders. The Pakistani
military official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said
the meeting touched on a possible agreement to allow U.S. Special
Forces to begin ground operations in Pakistan's tribal areas.
</P>
<P>
Maj. Gen. Athar Abbas, chief spokesman for the Pakistani
military, denied that there was any agreement for U.S. troops to
operate on Pakistani territory.
</P>
<P>
A NATO spokesman in Afghanistan said foreign forces are generally
prohibited from mounting cross-border attacks into Pakistan. The
spokesman, who gave his name only as Sgt. Yates, said NATO forces
occasionally use artillery or missiles to target insurgents who
attack foreign troops from Pakistani territory, but the rules of
engagement are very precise. "Our area of operations stops at the
border. We don't go over the border, period," Yates said.
</P>
<P>
In Afghanistan, NATO and U.S. military operations have recently
come under scrutiny because of an airstrike that Afghan and U.N.
officials said killed up to 90 civilians two weeks ago. On
Wednesday, McKiernan said that he concurred with a U.S. military
investigation that found that five civilians died in the
incident.
</P>
<P>
McKiernan expressed sorrow at the loss of civilian lives in the
strike, which began late on Aug. 21 in the village of Azizabad
and continued into the early morning hours of Aug. 22. He said
NATO would work to better coordinate with the Afghan government
and the U.N. mission in Afghanistan to respond to incidents
involving civilian casualties. -0-
