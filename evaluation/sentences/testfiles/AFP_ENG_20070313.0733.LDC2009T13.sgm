At least six people were killed and several others wounded
Wednesday in a massive explosion at a shop selling gunpowder in
the centre of the Afghan capital Kabul, police said.
</P>
<P>
The blast took place in a bazaar where hunting rifles, gunpowder
and bullets are sold near the presidential palace, government
offices and the headquarters of NATO's International Security
Assistance Force (ISAF).
</P>
<P>
Police said the explosion was caused by exploding gunpowder, but
an intelligence officer said it was a bomb blast. Afghan
soldiers, police and firefighters poured into the area.
</P>
<P>
A police colonel at the scene who asked not to be named said six
people were dead and eight wounded.
</P>
<P>
"So far we have recovered seven to eight bodies -- most of them
dead, some of them in a coma," a district police commander, Abdul
Rahman Rahimi, told AFP.
</P>
<P>
The explosion destroyed a row of mudbrick shops and left a three-
metre (10-foot) crater in the ground, an AFP reporter at the
scene said.
</P>
<P>
"We heard a huge explosion from one of the shops," said Ahmad
Fahim, who runs a bakery in the area. "There were people in most
of the shops. There are still bodies underneath the rubble."
</P>
<P>
People had started combing through the debris with their bare
hands and shovels to recover bodies.
</P>
<P>
The blast sent a column of dust and smoke into the air. ISAF
could not immediately confirm what had caused the explosion.
</P>
<P>
"We heard the blast, we went outside and we saw a huge plume of
smoke about half a mile south of ISAF," ISAF spokesman Colonel
Tom Collins told AFP.
</P>
<P>
Kabul was last year rocked by a series of explosions, including
several suicide bombings, but has not seen any attacks this year.
