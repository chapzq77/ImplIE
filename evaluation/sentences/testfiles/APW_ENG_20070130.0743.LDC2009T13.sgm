Dutch troops will not participate in destruction of poppy crops
in Afghanistan

AMSTERDAM, Netherlands 2007-01-30 12:33:20 UTC

<P>
Dutch soldiers serving in the NATO force in Afghanistan will not
take part in the destruction of opium poppy crops because it is
counterproductive to efforts to build public support for
reconstruction, a government minister said.
</P>
<P>
The minister of development, Agnes van Ardenne, said late Monday
that the ultimate purpose of Dutch participation in the NATO
stabilization force in Afghanistan is to promote reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
"That's only possible if the population is working with us, but
the population won't do that if people see that we, as it were,
are playing along with the game of destroying the income stream,
the only income stream of very many farmers," Van Ardenne said on
the television program Nova.
</P>
<P>
The cultivation of poppies -- used to produce opium, morphine and
heroin -- reached record levels in Afghanistan in 2006, and U.S.
officials have focused attention on plans to destroy the crop.
Opium sales are believed to help fund the Taliban, but also may
make up more than a quarter of the country's economy, according
to a World Bank study published in November.
</P>
<P>
Opium production from poppies in Afghanistan last year rose 49
percent to 6,700 tons, enough to supply 90 percent of the world's
heroin, according to the U.N.
</P>
<P>
NATO's International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan,
which recently increased in size to 32,000 troops, works together
with the Afghan government to carry out reconstruction projects
in the country's provinces.
</P>
<P>
Until now, ISAF's focus has often been on peacekeeping, but it
plans major pushes on both quelling the Taliban insurgency and
reconstruction efforts this spring. Washington hopes ISAF will
actively participate in poppy eradication projects, which have so
far been ineffectual.
</P>
<P>
In a blow to the U.S. anti-drug plan, Afghan President Hamid
Karzai said earlier this month he would not approve a Colombian-
style spraying program to eradicate the poppies, ordering them
plowed under instead.
</P>
<P>
U.S. company DynCorp International Inc. had hoped to win a
contract to carry out the spraying.
</P>
<P>
Afghan officials said the Cabinet was concerned about the impact
of herbicides on humans, legitimate crops and animals.
</P>
<P>
The ministers also likely feared a violent backlash from rural
Afghans protecting their livelihood.
</P>
<P>
In a second blow to the U.S. plan, Ardenne said she would advise
the governor of Uruzgan province to ignore Karzai's directive to
destroy crops in the absence of a viable alternative.
</P>
<P>
The Netherlands currently has around 1,900 soldiers in
Afghanistan, most in the southern province of Uruzgan.
</P>
<P>
Ardenne has just returned from a three-day visit to Dutch troops.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, U.S. Ambassador to Afghanistan Ronald Neumann
said the country has eradicated 1,483 acres (593 hectares) of
poppies so far this year -- compared to none by the same time
last year.
</P>
<P>
Still, that's only a fraction of the 407,000 acres (162,800
hectares) of poppies that were cultivated in 2006, including
173,000 acres (69,200 hectares) in Helmand province alone,
according to U.N. figures.
</P>
<P>
Asadullah Wafa, the governor of Helmand, said he approved of
Karzai's decision.
</P>
<P>
"There is another way to eradicate, like launching operations
through all the districts, and I hope the international community
will give us tractors and provide more troops to destroy
poppies," he said.
</P>
<P>
Uruzgan, adjacent to Helmand in the South, produces less than 10
percent of the country's poppy crop, according to the World Bank
study.
</P>
<P>
In a December visit to Kabul, John Walters, the top U.S. anti-
drug official, warned that Afghanistan could turn into a "narco-
state" unless "giant steps" were made toward eliminating poppies.
