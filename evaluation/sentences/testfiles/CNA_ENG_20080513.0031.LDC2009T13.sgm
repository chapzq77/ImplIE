A Taiwanese aboriginal youth club is slated to perform
aboriginal-style dances in two major cities in Texas later this
month in an effort to boost Taiwan-U.S. cultural exchanges, an
official of the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in Houston,
said Monday.

<P>
Twenty members of the club affiliated with the National Pingtung
University of Education, southern Taiwan were selected by
Taiwan's Overseas Compatriot Affairs Commission  and related
government agencies to go on a 22-day performance tour of the
central and southern United States, starting May 3, said the
official.

The club members, sponsored by the Houston Chapter of the Global
Alliance for Democracy and Peace and a Taiwan expatriate
association in Austin, are scheduled to perform in Houston and
Austin on May 23 and May 24, respectively, the official said.

<P>
Most members of the club are Taiwanese aboriginal students whose
mission is to promote Taiwan's aboriginal culture. Their
performances are being staged as part of a traditional Taiwanese
cultural week event being held around the United States. They
will return to Taiwan May 26.

Austin, the capital of the south-central U.S. state of Texas, is
the fourth largest city in the state, while Houston, located in
east Texas, is the largest city in the state and the fourth-
largest city in the United States.
