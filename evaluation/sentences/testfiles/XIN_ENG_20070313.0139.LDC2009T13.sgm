Roundup: Deposed Fiji PM struggles against "exile" by Xia Wenhui

WELLINGTON, March 13 (Xinhua)
</P>
<P>
Fiji's deposed Prime Minister Laisenia Qarase is seeking a court
order to allow him to return to capital Suva since last December
coup.
</P>
<P>
His lawyer Tevita Fa confirmed that they are looking into the
matter.
</P>
<P>
According to Radio NZ, Qarase's lawyer, Tevita Fa, said Tuesday
while Qarase already has a case before the High Court challenging
the legality of the interim administration, that does not stop
him bringing an additional case.
</P>
<P>
"Under the constitution, Qarase's right to free movement in Fiji
is guaranteed and that right can't be taken away by decree," said
Fa.
</P>
<P>
"It will be a case filed separately (to the current case
challenging the military overthrow)," said Fa.
</P>
<P>
Qarase has been on his home island in the Lau group since he fled
the capital after the military coup.
</P>
<P>
He has not been allowed back into Suva since then with airlines
and shipping companies reportedly told not to give Qarase
passage.
</P>
<P>
Qarase has questioned why the army is prohibiting him from
leaving his island home on Mavana, Lau since the coup.
</P>
<P>
Qarase has described the military's action as ungodly and
inexplicable.
</P>
<P>
He also said that he "will come to Suva when he wants to", but is
enjoying the island lifestyle for now.
</P>
<P>
But Qarase is now facing more pressure. The police in Fiji are
investigating whether he should be charged with treason over the
allegations he called for armed intervention from Australia and
New Zealand to prevent the coup.
</P>
<P>
Under Fijian law, anyone who instigates an invasion from abroad
may be charged with treason.
</P>
<P>
But Qarase has publicly denied the allegation, said Fijilive, a
Suva-based news service.
</P>
<P>
Qarase said he is obliged to assist police with their
investigations over allegations of treason.
</P>
<P>
Qarase said he understands what he has to do when police arrive
and will assist officers.
</P>
<P>
Qarase said, however, there is a double standard operating
because police have dropped investigations into the military
commander's actions in conducting the coup.
</P>
<P>
Commodore Voreqe Bainimarama, Fiji's military chief, now the
interim Prime Minister, overthrew Qarase with the support of the
3, 500-strong armed forces after accusing the government of
corruption.
</P>
<P>
"I am concerned, the allegations are of absolutely no basis. I
see no reason why I am being investigated," said Qarase.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, New Zealand Prime Minister Helen Clark said it
was "extraordinary" that Qarase was being accused of treason
following allegations he asked for Australian and New Zealand
forces to help him fight the military takeover.
</P>
<P>
Clark said Monday it was abundantly clear from the report that no
one, except those who had seized power in Fiji, thought what had
happened was anything but "unconstitutional and illegal."
</P>
<P>
On Friday foreign ministers from the 16 nation in the region will
meet in Vanuatu to discuss the situation in Fiji.
