' THE WORLDS OF LINCOLN KIRSTEIN ' : A PARAGON OF THE ARTS
</HEADLINE>

Lincoln Kirstein -- patron of the performing, visual and literary
arts; novelist; poet; critic and historian of dance, photography
and painting -- was one of nature's titans. He looked the role.
Nobody who saw or met him can easily have forgotten the imposing
physical impression he made. Tall, strong-browed, massive of
shoulders, thorax and head, he might have modeled as Atlas, who
in Greek mythology carried the world on his shoulders. His
energies were titanic too, as the anthologies and bibliographies
of his work have revealed. But what made him exceptional was that
he acted as if his main motto were not "I am" or "I do" but "I
serve." He put those shoulders to many wheels, often effacing his
own contribution in so doing.
</P>
<P>
This inspiring self-denying quality is at the heart of Martin
Duberman's new biography, "The Worlds of Lincoln Kirstein." In
one aside in parentheses Duberman remarks of Kirstein, "(never a
truly rich man, he gave away a larger proportion of his total
wealth than most patrons of the arts ever do)." The book is at
its best when Kirstein (1907-1996) is successfully engaged on
multiple fronts. Duberman quietly marvels, as any reader must
too, at how it was not enough for Kirstein in 1948 to forge the
New York City Ballet, his life's single greatest project. Despite
the immense struggles of organization and fundraising that that
task required, it also turns out that in 1948 Kirstein was busy
in the art world: He organized an exhibition at the Museum of
Modern Art (which he had served in many ways since its
foundation) of sculpture by Elie Nadelman. He also gave a lecture
tour ranging from Boston to Chicago (donating all his fees to the
New York City Ballet's predecessor, Ballet Society) and presented
the Hunter College premiere of an opera he commissioned.

Kirstein had many other years as busy as that, and on just as
many different fronts. Duberman's biography, drawing on vast
resources of unpublished diaries and correspondence, steers us
through Kirstein's founding and editing of the literary magazine
Hound and Horn (1927-33), his collaboration with Vaslav
Nijinsky's monstrously irritating and dishonest wife, Romola, in
ghostwriting her biography of her husband, his long and shifting
involvement with leftist politics and his extensive work for
MoMA.

<P>
For most of the first half of this book, however, Duberman seems
too close to his research. (There are two whole paragraphs on
Kirstein's teenage appendicitis.) But once Kirstein's plural
worlds are all well defined, Duberman is driving in top gear. The
narrative for 1945, for example, is particularly exciting, as
Kirstein, serving with the American Army in Europe, is central to
the recovery of the van Eyck "Adoration of the Lamb," which the
Germans had stolen in 1942 and hidden in a salt mine in Austria.
</P>
<P>
Since the world of the performing arts is littered with old
sexual gossip, we need biographies as sensitive as Julie
Kavanagh's "Secret Muses: The Life of Frederick Ashton," Meredith
Daneman's "Margot Fonteyn," and now this Kirstein biography (and
unlike the first two posthumous biographies of Rudolf Nureyev) to
connect private life to public art with honesty, seriousness and
a sense of proportion. It has never been a secret that Kirstein,
an intensely sexual creature, was involved with a number of men,
that he did plenty of gay cruising, and that he lost his heart to
a long series of Adonises.
</P>
<P>
Just how he combined this with some serious heterosexual
relationships in his youth, and with his marriage to Fidelma
Cadmus, is where Duberman is at his most delicate. Although the
book's first half charts a few more of Kirstein's homosexual
liaisons than it needs, Duberman is never salacious. And his
Kirstein becomes especially vivid when in the company of women:
his mother and sister, his lover and friend Muriel Draper, and
Fidelma. Kirstein's tender affection for her is not in question,
but Duberman lets us see Fidelma as a victim of Kirstein's driven
nature and of the position of women in her generation.
</P>
<P>
Having to play the hostess to all his guests and to live with his
private obsessions was more than she could sustain. Gradually she
withdrew from her career as a painter and then from life.
Kirstein suffered from depression and was at times hospitalized;
but his wife's breakdowns were eventually more permanent.
</P>
<P>
"The Worlds of Lincoln Kirstein" is so richly detailed that it
must be consulted by those interested in all whom Kirstein's life
brushed. I spotted only one significant omission: Tennessee
Williams, whom Kirstein helped early in the 1940s, albeit
briefly. Much new material emerges here about George Balanchine
above all. Yet, though Duberman knows which Balanchine ballets
are the most historically important, he shows no feeling for
them. In that sense alone he fails his subject. He quotes an
astonishing 1946 letter of Kirstein's: "The only justification I
have," he writes, is to enable Balanchine "to do exactly what he
wants to do in the way he wants to do it." What Balanchine wanted
and how are left unsaid by Duberman. Yet he shows us, powerfully,
the titan's work, his strength and his incidental afflictions.
The book has a gathering force.
