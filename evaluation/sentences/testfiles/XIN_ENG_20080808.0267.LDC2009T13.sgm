QINGDAO, East China, Aug. 8 (Xinhua)
</P>
<P>
Many Olympic sailors felt proud of carrying the national flag of
their own countries at the opening ceremony on Friday before
sailing their nations to Olympic glory.
</P>
<P>
Ciara Peelo, Ireland's most dedicated Laser Radial sailor, will
lead the 51-strong Olympic team at the National Stadium in
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
"The Olympic Games themselves are an inspiration. Honor will help
to motivate me to do my best for my country at the Games," she
said, the only female sailor of the Irish six-strong sailing
team.
</P>
<P>
Brazil's legendary double gold medalist Robert Scheidt also hoped
the honorary position would bring him luck for gunning the third
Olympic gold in a row.
</P>
<P>
"It was quite emotional. Usually, they do not announce the flag
bearer until right before the opening ceremony. It is very
special to have a flag presented to me directly from the
President," said Scheidt, Laser gold medalist in 1996 and 2004,
Laser silver medalist in 2000.
</P>
<P>
Alejandro Foglia, the only sailor from Uruguay, is not only the
flag bearer for the opening ceremony in Beijing, but also in
Qingdao.
</P>
<P>
"There are not very many Uruguayan athletes competing. I was
selected because of my commitment to the sport," said Foglia, 24,
from Laser class.
</P>
<P>
Barbara Kendall, windsurfer from New Zealand, is the first woman
to parade her country's colors at the opening ceremony. "It is
announced only a couple of days before the ceremony and it is
quite an event," said the 40-year-old from Auckland.
</P>
<P>
Some 300 sailors and coaches left Qingdao on Friday morning for
Beijing in two chartered planes to attend the opening ceremony.
