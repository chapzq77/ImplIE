US stocks lower as credit markets show strain

NEW YORK 2008-09-24 14:36:45 UTC

Financial markets turned lower again Wednesday, with stocks
mostly declining after a short-lived pop on investor Warren
Buffett's decision to invest $5 billion in Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. The credit markets showed added strain as investors await
news about the government's plan to rescue banks from crippling
debt.
</P>
<P>
Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc. said Tuesday it was investing
at least $5 billion in Goldman -- a move Wall Street took as sign
of support for the independent investment bank model. Besides
buying $5 billion in preferred stock, Berkshire also got warrants
to buy another $5 billion in Goldman's common stock.
</P>
<P>
Goldman Sachs also said it will sell $5 billion worth of common
stock to the public; the company and Morgan Stanley earlier this
week were granted approval to become bank holding companies,
which would help them strengthen their balance sheets.
</P>
<P>
Though Buffett's move appeared to soothe some investors, it
didn't alleviate concerns about the effectivenes of any
government bailout and about the health of the broader economy.
It could also lead to new questions from lawmakers for Treasury
Secretary Henry Paulson, a former co-CEO of Goldman Sachs. He and
Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke are appearing before
Congress for a second day Wednesday to brief lawmakers on a $700
billion bailout measure for financial services firms.
</P>
<P>
Their appearance on Capitol Hill Tuesday unnerved investors, who
questioned whether lawmakers were beginning to doubt the
necessity and form of the government bailout.
</P>
<P>
The waiting was clearly wearing on the credit markets, raising
concern again about liquidity.
</P>
<P>
Demand for short-term government Treasuries increased as
investors again sought safe places to keep cash. The yield on the
3-month Treasury bill, considered the safest short-term financial
asset, was at 0.41 percent early Wednesday, down from 0.79
percent late Tuesday. Last week, demand spiked so high that
the3-month bill's yield briefly dipped into negative territory;
investors were so focused on putting their money in safe assets
that they have been willing to accept very little or even
negative returns.
</P>
<P>
In other Treasury trading, the yield on the benchmark 10-year
Treasury note fell to 3.75 percent from 3.80 percent late
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In midmorning trading, the Dow Jones industrial average fell
30.67, or 0.28 percent, to 10,823.50. The Dow is down more than
500 points, or about 4.7 percent, for the week.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Standard &amp; Poor's
500 index rose 1.17, or 0.10 percent, to 1,189.39, and the Nasdaq
composite index rose 9.15, or 0.42 percent, to 2,162.48.
</P>
<P>
The dollar, whose struggles earlier this week contributed to
extreme volatility in other markets, was mixed, falling against
the euro but rising against the Japanese yen. Meanwhile, gold
prices rose.
</P>
<P>
Light, sweet crude for November delivery rose $1.97 to $108.57 a
barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
</P>
<P>
Investors appeared unfazed by a larger-than-expected drop in
sales of existing homes in August; their focus remained on the
bailout. The National Association of Realtors said sales fell by
2.2 percent; sales had been expected to fall by 1.6 percent,
according to economists surveyed by Thomson/IFR. The number of
unsold homes on the market dropped by 7 percent from a record set
in July. It marked the steepest drop in inventory since December
2006.
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advancers by about 4 to 3 on the New
York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 153.6 million shares.
</P>
<P>
The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 3.65, or 0.51
percent, to 705.54.
