ATLANTA -- Scott Avett grew up in blue-collar North Carolina and
lives there to this day, in the Piedmont, on 65 acres. His place
is above a wood shop.
</P>
<P>
"It's NASCAR country," he says. "It's much like 'Talladega
Nights."'
</P>
<P>
Scott is 30 years old. His father owned a welding company. His
mother taught reading. He grew up listening to John Denver and
Merle Haggard on eight-track tape.
</P>
<P>
Now he plays and sings in a twangy trio that bears his name - the
Avett Brothers, a band that exploits the tensions between the
rustic Old South and the cosmopolitan New South, between rootsy
bluegrass and rowdy punk rock, between reverence and irreverence.
</P>
<P>
The Avett Brothers obviously respect country music; when they
deconstruct the form, it's as though they're sacrificing a loved
one in the name of art - sort of like Jimi Hendrix igniting his
guitar. Thanks in part to their background in a rock band, the
brothers attack their instruments with destructive intensity -
they once broke 32 strings in a single gig.
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes," says Paul Lohr, the band's booking agent, "you have
to throw caution to the wind and risk some sour notes and some
out of tune strings or some completely broken strings to get
those moments of brilliance."
</P>
<P>
And yet, the Avetts can be tender. They write smart, funny,
heartbreaking country-tinged songs that tell shaggy dog stories
and reveal surprisingly vulnerable feelings. On May 15, they will
release a new album called "Emotionalism."
</P>
<P>
The band's duality is embodied in Seth Avett, Scott's younger
sibling. Seth is 26 and tall as summertime corn. He likes to wear
a pendant that he made himself, a sculpture of a human skull with
music notes for teeth.
</P>
<P>
Seth plays guitar and sings, sometimes rather loudly. He has had
to explain to Mother Avett that screaming isn't necessarily a bad
thing. Some emotions just can't be explained in words.
</P>
<P>
Seth and his bandmates travel from gig to gig in a green Ford van
decorated with both a Jesus fish and a sticker for the metal band
Danzig, which once released an album called "6:66 Satan's Child."
</P>
<P>
"You gotta be well-rounded," Seth deadpans. "There's some good
things to get from Danzig, and some good things to get from the
fish as well."
</P>
<P>
And then there's Bob Crawford. Bob is not an Avett brother, but
he is an Avett Brother.
</P>
<P>
Bob is 35. He plays upright bass. He has read biographies of
every president through Van Buren. He's a Yankee. He didn't
discover bluegrass until a college buddy dragged him to a
festival in Delaware. The next day he volunteered for the 6 a.m.
shift on his college radio station, playing Appalachian roots
music for the good people of New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
"People come out to see live music down here," he says one recent
night, backstage at Atlanta's Variety Playhouse. "And they never
did where I was from in South Jersey."
</P>
<P>
Getting to the roots
</P>
<P>
In concert and on record, the Avett Brothers make music that
simultaneously upholds and demolishes the Americana tradition.
The Avett Brothers play acoustically, harmonize sweetly and
shriek savagely. Their music also has an urban knowingness
despite their rural roots. The two collide in a primal ballad
called "Murdered in the City."
</P>
<P>
"Growing up in the country," Scott says, "it's been hard to
adjust to the amount of time we spend in cities."
</P>
<P>
If the band has a leader, it's Scott. In concert, he stands at
center stage. In conversation, he's thoughtfully chatty. He's
comfortable holding forth on, say, the Philadelphia painter
Thomas Eakins. And he describes his own development with a kind
of modest nonchalance.
</P>
<P>
His last day job was doing janitorial work.
</P>
<P>
"It's the kind of stuff," he says, "where you're looking in the
toilet at your reflection, wondering what it's all about."
</P>
<P>
After spending his younger days obsessed with grunge bands like
Soundgarden and Nirvana, Scott became curious about bluegrass
about a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
"Before that," he says, "nobody was going to pry me away from
anything that wasn't sharp as a knife."
</P>
<P>
He picked up the banjo to distinguish himself in a world full of
guitarists. He learned standards including "Foggy Mountain
Breakdown" and "Boil Them Cabbage" but says that he started
crafting his own songs as soon as he could play chords.
</P>
<P>
About five years after Scott started taking lessons, he began
giving them.
</P>
<P>
When Scott and Seth discovered that their angsty rock band, Nemo,
had - as Scott puts it - "imploded upon itself," they turned to
roots music and began focusing on the Avett Brothers.
</P>
<P>
Catharsis onstage
</P>
<P>
The band does not fit comfortably into any mainstream genre, or
even into any established subgenre. They're a little too hippie-
ish for alternative country yet way too scruffy for mainstream
country. They exist alongside a handful of other Americana
misfits, namely the shape-shifting songwriter Will Oldham and the
tight string band Old Crow Medicine Show. In their own ways, all
three of these groups are warping the traditional sound and shape
of country music.
</P>
<P>
"My favorite comparison to them," says agent Lohr, "is the
Violent Femmes crossed with Bob Dylan. Because they have that
wild, unbridled stage presence. Plus, Dylan is obviously one of
the greatest songwriters of all time."
</P>
<P>
The Avett Brothers are most powerful onstage, which is where they
spent about 180 nights last year.
</P>
<P>
They stand three across - Bob on the left, Seth on the right and
Scott in the middle. They dress up for shows by wearing jackets
or ties, adding another layer of incongruity. The formal clothes
clash with the unhinged music. They can also make the band
members hot. At a recent show in Athens' Georgia Theatre, sweat
flew off Scott's head in a rainy sheet.
</P>
<P>
Avett concerts showcase the band's panoramic range. Song forms
are all over the place - ballads, rockers, folk tunes,
instrumentals. All three members sing. The audience sometimes
joins them. Scott and Seth both play percussion instruments with
their feet, and Bob likes to twirl his bass as though it were a
dance partner.
</P>
<P>
To see an Avett Brothers concert is to witness an emotional and
physical catharsis. The effects become apparent backstage.
</P>
<P>
At Variety Playhouse, Seth spent the moments before the show
pacing around the artist lounge area. When his girlfriend asked
him to sit for a moment, he replied that he couldn't do that.
After the show, he slumped in a chair.
</P>
<P>
It says something about the intensity of an Avett Brothers show
that Seth Avett was unable to sit before the show, and unable to
stand afterward.
