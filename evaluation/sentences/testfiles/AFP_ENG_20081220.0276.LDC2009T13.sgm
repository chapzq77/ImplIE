Thailand awaits royal approval of new cabinet
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thailand was on Saturday awaiting the unveiling of new Prime
Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva's cabinet, which he says will bring
national reconciliation but which has already stirred
controversy.
</P>
<P>
Abhisit has vowed to bring stability to Thailand and boost an
economy battered by six months of protests against the last
government, which ended on December 3 after a court dissolved the
ruling People Power Party (PPP).
</P>
<P>
Oxford-educated Abhisit was voted in by parliament on December 15
with the help of defecting MPs, but the Democrat Party leader's
cabinet has already hit a snag with business leaders criticising
some ministers as inexperienced.
</P>
<P>
Local media reported that the outcry prompted a last-minute
change of industry minister before the list went to the revered
king for royal approval late Friday.
</P>
<P>
"Every coalition party has sent their list of ministers, and the
cabinet secretary has forwarded the list to the palace," Abhisit
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
"I am willing to listen to all criticism, but as head of
government I have to find a balance. I have told ministers of
that concern, so they must quickly work to create confidence and
select acceptable working teams."
</P>
<P>
Since May, Thailand has been beset by increasingly disruptive
protests by the People's Alliance for Democracy (PAD).
</P>
<P>
The PAD accused the now-defunct PPP of being disloyal to the
monarchy and of running Thailand on behalf of ousted premier
Thaksin Shinawatra, who lives in exile abroad to escape
corruption charges.
</P>
<P>
PAD protests reached their peak at the end of November when
thousands of their supporters occupied Bangkok's two main
airports for about a week, stranding up to 350,000 passengers and
causing massive economic damage.
</P>
<P>
The group only ended their siege after the PPP was dissolved over
vote fraud charges related to elections they won one year ago,
allowing the Democrats to win over former PPP lawmakers and small
parties to form the government.
</P>
<P>
Abhisit has said he wants to bring peace and stability back to
the kingdom after the protests and has tried to reach out to
Thaksin's supporters, but some of his reported choices for
cabinet posts have cast doubt on those promises.
</P>
<P>
Kasit Piromya, slated as the new foreign minister, was a vocal
supporter of the PAD and took to the stage repeatedly during
their six-month protest campaign to criticise the government.
</P>
<P>
The Democrat Party has already been accused of tacitly backing
the PAD, while supporters of Thaksin have accused the courts and
the army of staging a "silent coup" to get the establishment-
friendly Democrats into power.
