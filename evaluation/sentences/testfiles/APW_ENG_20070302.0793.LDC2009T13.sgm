Talks end with rival sides ' diametrically opposed '  on Kosovo '

Talks on the future status of Kosovo ended Friday with Serbian
and ethnic Albanian negotiators "diametrically opposed" to a plan
that would put the province on the road to eventual independence,
a U.N. envoy said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Martti Ahtisaari told reporters that the talks in Vienna were
over, and that he had invited Serbian and Kosovo Albanian leaders
to Vienna on March 10 for a final meeting before he sends the
package to the U.N. Security Council, which has the final say on
Kosovo's future status.
</P>
<P>
"I have to be honest in saying that, regarding the status
question, the parties remain diametrically opposed," he said.
</P>
<P>
Ahtisaari said he would now review the points raised over the
final round of talks "and see what sort of adjustments we might
make."
</P>
<P>
He did not elaborate, but Ahtisaari has made it clear in the past
that he would be unlikely to make substantial changes to his
58-page draft unless both sides agreed. Since neither side made
significant concessions, the package was likely to be delivered
to the Security Council essentially as it is.
</P>
<P>
Kosovo's deputy prime minister, Lutfi Haziri, conceded the final
round produced "no movement in bringing the sides closer."
</P>
<P>
"It was bad theater by the Serb side," Haziri told The Associated
Press, adding that ethnic Albanian leaders "don't believe there
will be substantial changes in the content" of the final package.
</P>
<P>
The draft would grant greater rights and security to Kosovo's
small Serbian minority while putting the province under
internationally supervised self-rule and granting it trappings of
statehood, such as a flag, anthem, army and constitution.
</P>
<P>
Skender Hyseni, an ethnic Albanian representative at the talks,
said the process was wearisome "because Belgrade's side came with
destructive stands and made efforts to introduce a new document."
</P>
<P>
"Their behavior was disappointing," Hyseni said.
</P>
<P>
Serbia's foreign minister, Vuk Draskovic, said in Zagreb,
Croatia, that his country would never accept the "forcible
reshaping" of its internationally recognized borders.
</P>
<P>
An independent Kosovo would cause "emotional shock and a sense of
humiliation" among Serbs, and that in turn could undermine
stability in the Balkans, Draskovic warned.
</P>
<P>
Kosovo has been under international administration since 1999,
when NATO airstrikes on Belgrade ended a brutal Serbian crackdown
on ethnic Albanian separatists in the province. About 16,000
NATO-led peacekeepers still patrol the region.
</P>
<P>
The hardening of positions amid a continuing stalemate raised new
questions about how the international community will reconcile
ethnic Albanians' quest for independence with Serbia's refusal to
grant the province anything even remotely resembling statehood.
</P>
<P>
Neither side is happy with the U.N. plan.
</P>
<P>
Serbs insist that Kosovo -- the heart of their ancient homeland
-- should remain part of their republic. And many ethnic
Albanians feel the plan grants too many concessions to the
Serbian minority while falling short of establishing the province
as a fully independent state.
</P>
<P>
"Just as expected, there was no agreement" in the final round,
said Leon Kojen, who co-led the Serbian team. He said Serbia
expected to get a "new version" of Ahtisaari's proposal next
week.
</P>
<P>
Ahtisaari's deputy, Austrian diplomat Albert Rohan, said that
despite the deadlock on the key question of whether Kosovo should
be put on the road to statehood or remain part of Serbian
territory, the talks were "extremely useful because the parties
talked directly."
</P>
<P>
"These talks have presented an opportunity" to close gaps on
other issues, said Ahtisaari, a former Finnish president who has
mediated in conflicts in Asia and Africa.
</P>
<P>
The plan could lead to a Security Council showdown between the
United States, which backs Kosovo's independence, and Russia, a
traditional Serbian ally. However, Russian officials recently
have suggested that Moscow might simply abstain from a vote on
the package rather than use its veto power to block it.
