Shares of Sears Holdings Corp. tumbled Monday after the retailer
warned falling sales would force it to post fourth-quarter and
full-year earnings well below analyst estimates.
</P>
<P>
The retailer, led by hedge fund manager Edward Lampert, said it
anticipates earning between $350 million (euro234.98 million) and
$470 million (euro315.54 million), or $2.59 (euro1.74) to $3.48
(euro2.34) per share for the quarter ending Feb. 2. For the year,
the company forecast earnings of $744 million (euro499.5 million)
to $864 million (euro580.06 million), or $5.13 (euro3.44) per
share to $5.96 (euro4) per share.

<P>
Analysts polled by Thomson Financial had hoped for fourth-quarter
earnings of $4.43 (euro2.97) per share and a full-year profit of
$6.64 (euro4.46) per share
</P>
<P>
Shares fell $7.63, or 7.9 percent, to $88.54 in morning trading
Monday after briefly falling to a 52-week low of $86.04.

The ailing Hoffman Estates-based company, which owns Sears and
Kmart stores, said it lowered earnings projections after sales
continued to slump.
</P>
<P>
Domestic same-store sales fell 3.5 percent during the nine-week
holiday season in November and December because of weakness in
Kmart's seasonal categories and Sears' apparel and tools. The
decline was partially offset by higher sales of home electronics.
</P>
<P>
The company said Sears domestic same-store sales slipped 2.8
percent for the nine-week period that ended Jan. 5, while Kmart
same-store sales dropped 4.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
Same-store sales, or sales at stores open at least a year, are a
key indicator of retailer performance that measures growth at
existing stores instead of newly opened ones.
</P>
<P>
Sears blamed the poor performance on growing competition, the
slowdown in the housing market and consumers' credit fears.
</P>
<P>
The bad news prompted at least one analyst to downgrade the
company's stock.
</P>
<P>
Credit Suisse analyst Gary Balter dropped his rating to
"Underperform" from "Outperform" Monday, citing the company's
declining real estate and brand value. He also slashed his price
target from $150 (euro100.70) to $70 (euro47).
