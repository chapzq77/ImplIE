Senator ' s handling of lewd conduct case breaks usual pattern of
Washington scandal
</HEADLINE>

WASHINGTON 2007-08-29 17:56:26 UTC
</P>
<P>
Idaho Sen. Larry Craig is not sticking to the script about how
Washington sex scandals play out. In fact, he is following it
backward.
</P>
<P>
The rich history of powerful figures accused of misbehavior shows
they tend to deny it indignantly, try to ride the storm with
tortured explanations, then give in to contrition if they're
cornered.
</P>
<P>
Not Craig. First came an admission of guilt -- and now the
defiant protestation of innocence.
</P>
<P>
His declaration Tuesday that "I did nothing wrong" came weeks
after he pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct in the men's room
at the Minneapolis airport. He vowed to tough it out even as his
party's leaders called for a Senate ethics investigation.
</P>
<P>
Eric Dezenhall, a crisis-management consultant, has seen many
follow this unwritten rule when fighting to save their career
from scandal: "If you're guilty, repent; if you're innocent
attack."
</P>
<P>
That could prove tough in Craig's case, considering his plea. The
Hennepin County, Minnesota, court docket said he paid $575
(euro421) in fines and fees and was put on unsupervised probation
for a year. A 10-day sentence in the county workhouse was stayed.
</P>
<P>
The undercover office who arrested Craig in the men's room
alleged he had engaged in actions "often used by persons
communicating a desire to engage in sexual conduct."
</P>
<P>
There is no clear road map to surviving the revelation of
unsavory behavior -- what works for one figure sinks another.
</P>
<P>
Gary Hart saw his presidential ambitions dashed by his "fool
mistake" of an extramarital affair while Bill Clinton overcame
multiple "bimbo eruptions" to win the presidency, then survived
impeachment in the Monica Lewinsky scandal to leave office with
high ratings.
</P>
<P>
Now, Capitol Hill is again looking into misconduct by one of its
own, with memories still fresh of the explosive page scandal a
year ago.
</P>
<P>
That episode led to the swift resignation of Florida Republican
Rep. Mark Foley, months of recrimination during the election
campaign over the stewardship of young people serving as
congressional pages, and a criminal investigation that continues
in Florida over whether Foley tried to seduce underage boys.
</P>
<P>
A scandal sampler:
</P>
<P>
--President Bill Clinton gave evasive and misleading testimony
under oath and publicly denied having sexual relations with "that
woman," former intern Lewinsky, only to be forced into a
humiliating reversal.
</P>
<P>
He was impeached and then acquitted in a 1999 Senate trial.
</P>
<P>
--Barack Obama, now running for the Democratic presidential
nomination, found his entry into national politics eased when his
Republican opponent in the 2004 Illinois Senate race, Jack Ryan,
dropped out. Divorce papers filed by his wife alleged he had
taken her to "bizarre clubs" and asked her to have sex in front
of other people.
</P>
<P>
Ryan denied that. He acknowledged only that they went to one
avant-garde club in Paris where they both felt creepy. Obama
easily defeated Ryan's late replacement, Alan Keyes, in what had
been a Republican seat.
</P>
<P>
--Rep. Bob Livingston, was on the verge of becoming Republican
House speaker in 1998 when he acknowledged straying in his
marriage. He resigned from Congress in a couple of months.
</P>
<P>
--Sen. Hart was the favorite for the Democratic presidential
nomination in 1987, three weeks into his campaign, when The Miami
Herald reported he had spent a night and a day with a young woman
while his wife was away. Hart, who had challenged the press to
check on rumors of philandering, initially denounced the report
as preposterous. But his liaison with Donna Rice, who had also
been photographed sitting on his lap near a yacht named "Monkey
Business," sank his campaign.
</P>
<P>
--Republican Sen. Bob Packwood resigned in 1995 amid allegations
he made unwanted sexual advances to 17 female employees and
colleagues, solicited jobs from lobbyists for his former wife and
altered his personal diaries to obstruct an ethics investigation.
</P>
<P>
--Democratic Rep. Gary Condit lost re-election in 2002 after the
disappearance of Chandra Levy, a former intern with the U.S.
Bureau of Prisons in Washington. Her remains were found in May
2002 in a Washington park, and no one has been charged in her
death. Condit reportedly told police that he and Levy had had an
affair, although he swore in a deposition that they were just
friends. He denied involvement in her disappearance.
</P>
<P>
--Democratic Rep. Barney Frank was reprimanded by the House in
1989 for using his influence on behalf of prostitute Stephen
Gobie. Frank admitted paying Gobie for sex, hiring him with his
own money as an aide and writing a letter on his behalf.
</P>
<P>
A repentant Frank faced constituents at a meeting until they ran
out of questions, acknowledging, "I did not handle the pressures
of having a public life, of being a closeted gay man, nearly as
well as I should have."
</P>
<P>
He won their acceptance -- and re-election ever since.
