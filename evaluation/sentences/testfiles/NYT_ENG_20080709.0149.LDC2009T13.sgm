No Challenger?  No Problem Hot SRT8 muscle car is still available
at some dealerships  By Eric Morath  The Detroit News  The 2008
Dodge Challenger SRT8 is not sold out after all.
</P>
<P>
The retro-looking muscle car can still be found through some
Chrysler LLC dealers, including one in northern Macomb County
that has 19 Challengers for sale. That's a surprising number
considering the automaker has said the entire production run of
the vehicle was sold even before the first ones rolled off the
assembly line in May.
</P>
<P>
In truth, customer names were attached to the vast majority of
the 6,400 limited-edition Challengers as they were built in
Brampton, Ont., said Curtrise Garner, a Chrysler spokeswoman. But
a quarter of the cars were set aside for dealer orders.
</P>
<P>
While only two hard-to-find Challengers were in the lot at Dick
Huvaere's Richmond Chrysler Jeep Dodge on Wednesday, more are
expected. The dealership didn't take any customer pre-orders.
</P>
<P>
General Manager Jim Simpson is hoping to create a little
excitement by stocking his lot with the Hemi Orange, Silver
Metallic and Brilliant Black Challengers.
</P>
<P>
An ad in The Macomb Daily this week touted that the dealership
had nine black, eight orange and two silver Hemi-powered coupes
available for sale.
</P>
<P>
"People just love these cars," Simpson said. "I wish I had 50 of
them."
</P>
<P>
So far, Simpson has sold just one, even after inviting about 20
interested customers to view the first Challenger to arrive.
Along with the two on the lot now, four should arrive within
days, and the remainder delivered later this month.
</P>
<P>
Despite several inquiries from customers, Simpson did not take
preorders. In the past, as was the case with the Dodge Viper,
preorders resulted in constant calls from anxious fans and
cancellations when customers decided the vehicles weren't what
they expected or cost more than they could afford.
</P>
<P>
The dealer is hoping to score a premium price on the rebirth of
the 1970s classic. On its Web site, Huvaere priced the Challenger
at $45,145, plus applicable taxes -- about $7,000 more than the
manufacturer's suggested retail price set late last year. As
independent businesses, dealers may charge more than the
suggested price.
</P>
<P>
"We're negotiating each price with the individual customer,"
Simpson said. "We're not getting a huge amount over sticker."
</P>
<P>
In other parts of the country, Challengers are nearly impossible
to find.
</P>
<P>
"There's not a dealer up and down the coast here that has a
Challenger," said Jon Meyers, owner of Naples Dodge in Naples,
Fla. He took pre-orders for just three days and sold all eight
Challengers he was allotted before they hit his lot.
</P>
<P>
Van Dyke Dodge in Warren has two Challengers left. Owner Carl
Galeana said he pre-sold 16 Challengers and ordered five more to
be used as demo cars, as vehicles for politicians to ride in
Fourth of July parades, and to draw attention to his store.
</P>
<P>
"I have just a couple left," he said "And I might need to buy one
for myself."
