Basketball: USA Basketball leaves Colorado for Phoenix suburbs
</HEADLINE>

<P>
USA Basketball announced plans to move from Colorado Springs to
suburban Phoenix here on Tuesday, relocating the organization to
the home area of board of directors chairman Jerry Colangelo.
</P>
<P>
A new complex to house USA Basketball's executive offices, a
multi-court training facility, a sports medicine clinic and a
150-room hotel will be built next to a National Hockey League
arena and National Football League stadium.
</P>
<P>
The US governing body for the sport oversees selection of the
Olympic team of National Basketball Association stars. The
Americans reclaimed gold at the Beijing Olympics after taking
bronze in 2004 at Athens.
</P>
<P>
"We are very excited to become part of Glendale's growing roster
of elite sports properties and look forward to (making) the USA
Basketball campus an important destination for future basketball
programs at all levels," said Val Ackerman, outgoing USA
Basketball chair who guided the move.
</P>
<P>
The facility would be perfect to host future USA Basketball
training camps and makes the area a likely host for future
national and international basketball events.
</P>
<P>
Colangelo, 68, was elected chairman of the board last week
through 2012 and is an executive with the NBA Phoenix Suns. His
program requiring NBA players to make a three-year commitment to
national duty helped the US team reclaim gold.
