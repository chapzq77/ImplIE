Another Republican joins Lugar in calling for U.S. troops to
start coming home

Sen. George Voinovich said Tuesday the U.S. should begin pulling
troops out of Iraq, joining Richard Lugar as the second
Republican lawmaker in as many days to suggest President George
W. Bush's war strategy is failing.
</P>
<P>
He said the Iraqi people must become more involved and "I don't
think they'll get it until they know we're leaving."
</P>
<P>
The Ohio senator's remarks followed similar comments by Lugar,
the top Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, the
previous night. The two Republican senators previously had
expressed concerns about Bush's decision to send 30,000 extra
troops to Iraq in a massive U.S.-led security push in Baghdad and
Anbar province. But they had stopped short of saying U.S. troops
should leave and declined to back Democratic legislation setting
a deadline for troop withdrawals.
</P>
<P>
"We must not abandon our mission, but we must begin a transition
where the Iraqi government and its neighbors play a larger role
in stabilizing Iraq," Voinovich wrote in a letter to Bush.
</P>
<P>
Lugar and Voinovich said they were still not ready to insist on a
timetable for withdrawal. But they both made it clear their
patience was gone.
</P>
<P>
Once Iraq's neighbors "know we are genuinely leaving, I think all
of a sudden the fear of God will descend upon them and say,
'We've got to get involved in this thing,'" Voinovich told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
"It can't be something that is precipitous, but I do believe that
it should be enough so that people know we are indeed
disengaging," he added.
</P>
<P>
The loss of Republican support for the president's strategy is
significant. Democrats may still not be able to push through
legislation demanding an end date to the war, but softer
alternative proposals are in the works that could still challenge
Bush.
</P>
<P>
After a holiday recess early next month, "you'll be hearing a
number of statements from other (Republican) colleagues,"
predicted Sen. John Warner, a longtime skeptic of the war
strategy.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman John Ullyot said Warner is drafting a legislative
proposal on the war, but declined to discuss the details. The
measure would likely be offered as an amendment to the 2008
defense authorization bill on the floor next month.
</P>
<P>
The White House on Tuesday appealed to members for more patience
on the war in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that members of the House and Senate will give the
Baghdad security plan a chance to unfold," said White House
spokesman Tony Snow.
</P>
<P>
Snow also said Lugar was a thoughtful man and that his remarks
came as no surprise.
</P>
<P>
"We've known that he's had reservations about the policy for some
time," he said.
</P>
<P>
In January, Lugar expressed concerns about the president's
decision to send 30,000 extra troops to Baghdad. But he voted
against a resolution opposing Bush's troop build up, contending
that the nonbinding measure would have no practical effect. In
the spring, he voted against a Democratic bill that would have
triggered troop withdrawals by Oct. 1 with the goal of completing
the pullout in six months.
</P>
<P>
In a floor speech Monday, Lugar said the U.S. should reduce the
military's role in Iraq and called on Bush to press other
diplomatic and economic initiatives instead. Because of Lugar's
position as the top Republican on the Foreign Relations
Committee, his speech was a considered a blow to the
administration as it tries to shore up sagging political support
for the unpopular war.
</P>
<P>
"In my judgment, the costs and risks of continuing down the
current path outweigh the potential benefits that might be
achieved," Lugar, R-Ind., said in a Senate floor speech.
"Persisting indefinitely with the surge strategy will delay
policy adjustments that have a better chance of protecting our
vital interests over the long term."
