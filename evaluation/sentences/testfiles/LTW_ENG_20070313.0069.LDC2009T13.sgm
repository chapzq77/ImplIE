Las Vegas' Water Nymph
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pat Mulroy grew up in Germany, the daughter of an American father
in the U.S. military and a German mother.
</P>
<P>
Her father was a stickler for language -- she speaks without a
trace of an accent -- and Mulroy always wanted to live in the
U.S. She got her chance when a University of Nevada-Las Vegas
dean who knew her program head at the University of Munich
offered her a senior scholarship and a teaching assistantship to
pursue a master's degree in German literature.
</P>
<P>
``That was my ticket,'' she says. ``So I packed up all my
belongings, and on Aug. 24, 1974, I landed at McCarran
International Airport.''
</P>
<P>
She arrived at night, checked into a motel and encountered her
first round bed and mirrored ceiling. The next morning, she
peered out the window, expecting Sahara-like sand dunes. Instead,
she found herself in the land of kitsch.
</P>
<P>
``I was in shock. The whole thing was like an out-of-body
experience.''
</P>
<P>
Except for a brief doctoral stint at Stanford, she has stayed in
Las Vegas, first working for Clark County government and then Las
Vegas Valley Water District. She married a native Nevadan, and
has two college-age children.
</P>
<P>
``It just became home'' says Mulroy, 54. ``I had grown to
appreciate its quirkiness and how different it is.''
