Dollar, yen gain on fresh flight to safety
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The dollar and yen attracted buyers Friday as investors looked
for safety amid news that the eurozone fell into recession and
world leaders met for a summit in Washington on the global
financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
At 2200 GMT, the euro fell to 1.2591 dollars from 1.2779 dollars
late in New York on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The dollar dropped slightly to 97.06 yen from 97.67 yen on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The pound remained sharply lower meanwhile at 1.4733 dollars from
1.482, after hitting a six-year low of 1.4557 earlier in the
week.
</P>
<P>
The market digested news that the eurozone was in recession, and
data showing a steep fall in US retail sales, the main driver of
economic activity.
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department said US retail sales tumbled a record 2.8
percent in October as consumers hunkered down in the face of a
sharply slowing economy.
</P>
<P>
The retail report "wasn't fundamentally bullish for US assets,
but instead, the disappointing nature of the news triggered
flight to quality," said Terri Belkas at Forex Capital
Management.
</P>
<P>
The dollar and yen have been the main beneficiaries of the
financial turmoil on the assumption that the US and Japanese
economies are best prepared to weather the global economic storm,
but some of the moves are hard to explain.
</P>
<P>
Independent currency analyst Larry Greenberg said: "Recent
foreign exchange movements have exceeded what fundamental
economic discrepancies justify. The biggest winner in this
reconfiguration has been the yen followed by the dollar.
Commodity-sensitive currencies and sterling are the main losers."
</P>
<P>
The market saw news that the economy of the 15 nations sharing
the euro has slumped into recession for the first time, with
gross domestic product (GDP) falling 0.2 percent in the second
and third quarters.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said this would likely lead to rate cuts by the European
Central Bank. Traditionally, lower interest rates make a currency
less attractive to investors even though they can help to boost
economic growth.
</P>
<P>
The ECB last week cut its key lending rate by 0.50 percentage
points to 3.25 percent.
</P>
<P>
Despite sharp falls in US stocks markets on weak retail data,
economists at Commerzbank said the dollar was still viewed as a
relative safe haven in gloomy economic times.
</P>
<P>
"The fear of recession is ... unlikely to recede and the dollar
will continue to benefit from the flight to quality, while
trading will remain volatile," they said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Foreign exchange dealers said that the dollar could win a further
boost against the euro should leaders of the world's 20 largest
economies hammer out a coordinated fiscal stimulus plan at
Saturday's emergency summit in Washington.
</P>
<P>
In late New York trade, the dollar stood at 1.1976 Swiss francs
from 1.1866 Thursday.
