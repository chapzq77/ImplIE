<P>
India's first unmanned moon mission entered lunar space early
Tuesday as part of its final journey this week into the moon's
orbit, a top space official said.
</P>
<P>
The Chandrayaan-1 spacecraft was launched with an Indian-built
rocket on October 22 from the country's southeastern coast.
</P>
<P>
"The operation to put Chandrayaan into lunar space went off very
well," S. Satish, director of the Indian Space Research
Organisation (ISRO) told AFP.
</P>
<P>
The spacecraft is now 1,000 kilometres (600 miles) from the moon,
enabling its terrain-mapping camera to shoot pictures of it.
</P>
<P>
Scientists are preparing for the next major stage to enable the
spacecraft to enter lunar orbit on Saturday and position itself
about 100 kilometres from the moon's surface.
</P>
<P>
Once the mission is in the lunar orbit, it will stabilise in
about a week, after which it will send a probe instrument to the
moon's surface.
</P>
<P>
Chandrayaan carries 11 payloads -- five from India and others
from abroad.
</P>
<P>
During a two-year orbital mission, it will provide a detailed map
of the mineral, chemical and topographical characteristics of the
moon's surface.
</P>
<P>
The mission will cost India 80 million dollars.
