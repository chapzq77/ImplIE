Australia, Philippines sign tsunami warning deals
</P>
<P>
Eds: SUBS 2nd graf to ADD detail on data transmission time

VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- Australia and the Philippines signed
agreements Friday enabling them to receive real-time data on any
earthquake that could cause a tsunami, information that would
come from an organization overseeing a treaty banning nuclear
explosions.
</P>
<P>
The Vienna-based Preparatory Commission for the Comprehensive
Nuclear Test Ban Treaty Organization said data it collects at its
monitoring facilities, which are set up to detect nuclear
explosions, could be transmitted within 30 seconds and give
authorities two and a half minutes of additional warning.
</P>
<P>
That vital time could be used to alert the public ahead of the
devastating waves.
</P>
<P>
In December 2004, a massive earthquake off Indonesia's Sumatra
island triggered a tsunami that killed more than 230,000 people
-- 131,000 of them in Aceh province alone.
</P>
<P>
A tsunami off Java island last year killed nearly 5,000.
</P>
<P>
The Vienna-based organization's executive secretary, Tibor Toth,
signed separate agreements with Philippine Foreign Secretary
Alberto Romulo and Peter Shannon, Australia's permanent
representative to the United Nations in Vienna.
</P>
<P>
"It is very, very important," Romulo said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Shannon said the deal was "part of a network that has developed
since the terrible disasters that the Asia-Pacific region
experienced."
</P>
<P>
The organization has been providing real-time and continuous data
on a test basis to tsunami warning centers in Australia, Hawaii,
Japan and Malaysia since March 2005 in collaboration with UNESCO.
</P>
<P>
In August, Japan signed a formal agreement for this kind of
warning. Indonesia is expected to follow suit in November.
