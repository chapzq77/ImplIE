FORMER OUTSIDE COUNSEL IS CHARGED IN REFCO FRAUD
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Federal prosecutors charged the former outside counsel for the
bankrupt commodities brokerage firm Refco on Tuesday with fraud
tied to the eventual collapse of the commodities and futures
brokerage.
</P>
<P>
Joseph P. Collins, 57, of the law firm Mayer Brown, faces 11
counts including securities fraud, wire fraud and filing false
statements with federal regulators. Separately, the Securities
and Exchange Commission filed a civil suit against Collins on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Collins' role in this fraud was vital," Michael J. Garcia,
the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, said at
a news conference.
</P>
<P>
It is rare for outside counsel to be charged for fraud supposedly
committed by their clients; not even Enron's outside lawyers
faced criminal charges.
</P>
<P>
"Joe Collins is an innocent victim of the Refco fraud," Collins'
lawyer, William Schwartz, said in a statement. "This indictment
should send a chill down the spine of every transactional lawyer
who believes he or she is representing an honest client."
</P>
<P>
But Garcia said that the charges did not signal a new trend of
prosecuting outside lawyers. "The vast majority of outside
counsel is law-abiding," he said.
</P>
<P>
The announcement is the latest twist in the two-year-old fraud
case, which arose in the wake of Refco's demise. Once one of the
world's largest commodities brokerage firms, Refco went public in
2005, only to begin crumbling two months later after it disclosed
that Philip R. Bennett, then its chief executive, had hidden $430
million in loans owed to the company.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors say that Collins, who oversaw Mayer Brown's work for
Refco from the mid-1990s to 2005, supervised the structuring of
transactions in which Refco temporarily shuffled debt to related
companies and third parties. Those loans were reversed shortly
after Refco's quarterly periods ended.
</P>
<P>
Collins also drafted documents that misrepresented that debt to
Thomas H. Lee Partners, the private equity firm that bought a
stake in the company in 2004, and to the SEC before Refco went
public, according to the complaint.
</P>
<P>
Bennett, who has pleaded not guilty to fraud charges, is
scheduled to go on trial next year. Others facing criminal
charges include Robert C. Trosten, Refco's former chief financial
officer, and Tone N. Grant, the firm's former president.
</P>
<P>
Mayer Brown, based in Chicago and formerly known as Mayer, Brown,
Rowe &amp;amp; Maw, said in a statement that Collins was on leave
and that the firm was cooperating with federal authorities. It is
facing lawsuits by trusts representing Refco's creditors.
</P>
<P>
"Our review of the evidence available to us shows that the firm
acted in a professional, competent and ethical manner in its work
on behalf of Refco," Mayer Brown said in its statement.
