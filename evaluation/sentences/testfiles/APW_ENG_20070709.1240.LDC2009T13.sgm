women

LOS ANGELES 2007-07-09 21:49:46 UTC

<P>
The judge in music producer Phil Spector's murder trial reversed
an earlier ruling Monday and decided to allow jurors to hear
damaging testimony from a celebrity security guard who says he
heard Spector rant profanely against women and declare they
should all be shot in the head.
</P>
<P>
The ruling came after Vincent Tannazzo, a retired New York City
police detective, testified without the jury present that at two
Manhattan Christmas parties given a year apart in the early
1990s, Spector was ejected, yelling obscenities against women and
shouting, "These (expletive for women). They all deserve a bullet
in their heads."
</P>
<P>
While he originally thought it was inadmissible because it was
too long ago and did not address the specific details of the Feb.
3, 2003, gunshot death of actress Lana Clarkson, Superior Court
Judge Larry Paul Fidler said he researched the law further and
changed his mind.
</P>
<P>
Although the comments by Spector may have occurred as long ago as
1993, they were relevant to show Spector's state of mind toward
women, the judge said.
</P>
<P>
"In this case you have a woman who is shot in the head," Fidler
said, referring to Clarkson's death from a bullet fired through
her mouth. "It is highly particularized."
</P>
<P>
The defense contends Clarkson shot herself.
</P>
<P>
The judge also said the testimony "tends to show the depth of Mr.
Spector's anger."
</P>
<P>
Defense attorney Roger Rosen denounced the testimony as
"character assassination" and said it should be excluded.
</P>
<P>
In both instances, a year apart, Tannazzo said he ejected a
ranting Spector from the parties hosted by comedian Joan Rivers.
</P>
<P>
On the first occasion in 1993 or 1994, Dorothy Melvin, Rivers'
manager, called him at his post outside the party, Tannazzo said.
</P>
<P>
"She said, 'Vinnie, get up here. Phil Spector just pulled out a
gun,'" Tannazzo testified.
</P>
<P>
He could tell Spector had a handgun in his waistband, and the
producer made the comment about women deserving to be shot in the
head.
</P>
<P>
At the second party, Tannazzo said he was again called to escort
Spector outside.
</P>
<P>
This time, he said, another woman walked out while Spector was
leaving and "Phil Spector looked at her and said, 'That
(expletive). I ought to put a bullet in her head right now.'"
</P>
<P>
The Tannazzo issue came up as the trial resumed after a one-week
recess for the Independence Day holiday. The defense has already
begun its side of the case, but the judge's ruling allowed the
prosecution to reopen its case to call him to the stand.
</P>
<P>
Spector, 67, rose to fame in the 1960s with a recording technique
known as the "Wall of Sound." Clarkson, 40, was a struggling
actress best known for her role in the 1985 film "Barbarian
Queen." She was working as a nightclub hostess when she met
Spector and agreed to go to his suburban mansion when she got off
work in the early morning of Feb. 3, 2003. She died of a gunshot
in his foyer a few hours later.
