testimony from Fed chairman

NEW YORK 2008-04-03 13:01:29 UTC

<P>
Wall Street appeared set to drop a bit at Thursday's opening,
with investors likely to behave warily ahead of a second day of
congressional testimony from Federal Reserve Chairman Ben
Bernanke.
</P>
<P>
The Fed chief will appear before the Senate Banking Committee at
10 a.m. Eastern time (1400 GMT). Bernanke sent a number of
negative signals Wednesday during testimony to the Joint
Econoomic Committee, saying a recession is possible.
</P>
<P>
If Bernanke reiterates those sentiments Thursday, there could be
selling throughout the session. Many economists previously have
said they think the economy is shrinking, but the Fed chairman
carries special weight with investors and his pronouncements can
influence the market.
</P>
<P>
The latest jobless claims report also could keep stocks under
pressure. The Labor Department reported that the number of people
applying for unemployment benefits in the latest week rose by a
full 38,000 to 407,000, the highest level since September 2005.
The less volatile four-week average of claims increased by 15,750
to 374,500.
</P>
<P>
The report comes just a day before the much-awaited March
employment report. It should fuel concerns about deterioration in
the labor market and keep the recession fears in the forefront.
</P>
<P>
The Institute for Supply Management will put out its March survey
of the services sector at 10 a.m. (1400 GMT). That poll is
expected to produce a headline reading of 50.1, which would
represent an improvement over 49.3 in February. Readings over 50
indicate expansion so the projected result would indicate that
the services sector has begun to grow again.
</P>
<P>
The futures contract for the Dow Jones industrial average fell 55
points, or 0.4 percent, to 12,564. Futures contracts for the
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index fell 7.60 points, or 0.5 percent,
at 1,363.30 and Nasdaq 100 futures declined 17 points, or 1.1
percent, to 1,845.2.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, stocks closed lower due to investor worries that a
sharp jump in oil prices could be another sign that consumers are
under stress and that the economy has entered a recession.
</P>
<P>
Research In Motion late Wednesday issued an above-forecast
earnings report and a positive outlook that indicated the company
expects to perform well even with the weaker economy.
