BUSH RULES OUT BID BY CONGRESS FOR IRAQ PULLOUT

WASHINGTON
</P>
<P>
With both houses of Congress now firmly on record in favor of
withdrawing from Iraq, President Bush vowed Wednesday not to
negotiate a timetable with Democrats, and a confrontation
appeared inevitable as each side prepared to blame the other for
delays in providing money for the war.
</P>
<P>
"Now, some of them believe that by delaying funding for our
troops, they can force me to accept restrictions on our
commanders that I believe would make withdrawal and defeat more
likely," Bush told an audience of cattlemen and ranchers. "That's
not going to happen. If Congress fails to pass a bill to fund our
troops on the front lines, the American people will know who to
hold responsible."
</P>
<P>
Bush and congressional Democrats are already deadlocked over the
Democrats' demands for testimony from top White House officials
in an inquiry into the firing of federal prosecutors. The
president's remarks on Wednesday, a day after the Senate voted
for the first time in favor of setting a withdrawal date, set the
stage for a second clash.
</P>
<P>
That puts Bush in the difficult position of fighting the new
Democratic majority on two fronts, both the war spending and the
prosecutors. On Wednesday, he seemed in no mood to back down from
the war spending fight. As he quoted a newspaper editorial --
from The Los Angeles Times, though he did not mention it by name
-- accusing Democrats of "the worst kind of congressional
meddling in military strategy," Bush appeared almost eager for a
battle. And Democrats seemed eager to give it to him.
</P>
<P>
Rep. Nancy Pelosi of California, the House speaker, said Bush
should "calm down with the threats," and Sen. Harry Reid of
Nevada, the Democratic leader, said his impression was that Bush
"doesn't want anything other than a confrontation."
</P>
<P>
The House approved its version of the spending bill last week,
and the Senate was expected to approve its version on Thursday.
Democrats said they were ready to begin House-Senate negotiations
quickly to produce a final version to send to the president.
</P>
<P>
The Democratic leaders, Pelosi and Reid, tried to strike a
conciliatory tone, stressing they will deliver all the money Bush
requested. In a joint letter to the president, they said they
stood ready to work with the White House, "But your threats to
veto a bill that has not even been presented to you indicate that
you may not be ready to work with us."
