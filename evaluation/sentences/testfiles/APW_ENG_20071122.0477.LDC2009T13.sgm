<HEADLINE>
Lightly-rated American team of Weekley and Slocum take lead at
World Cup

SHENZHEN, China 2007-11-22 10:20:58 UTC

<P>
Boo Weekley and Heath Slocum combined for an 11-under 61 to take
a surprise lead after Thursday's first round of the World Cup of
Golf in southern China.
</P>
<P>
With 13 other higher-ranked American players declining to play in
the team event at the Mission Hills Golf Club, Weekley -- ranked
No. 43 on the world list -- and his partner showed the depth of
American golf.
</P>
<P>
Defending champion Germany, represented by Alex Cejka and Martin
Kaymer, shot 62 to be a stroke behind. Six other teams were in a
logjam at 63: Finland, Wales, Scotland, South Africa, Thailand
and England.
</P>
<P>
Thursday's first round was played under the fourballs (better
ball) format. But Friday will be tougher with scores sure to soar
in foursomes (alternate-shot). Though it's a stroke-play event,
match-play rules are in force.
</P>
<P>
Weekley's caddie Joe Pyle was detained in Hong Kong on Tuesday,
lacking the proper visa to enter mainland China. He arrived
Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
"I walked in at about 6 (p.m.) and he was asleep and he slept all
the way until about 4 this morning," Weekley said. "He said he
was ready to get after it, and that's what we did today."
</P>
<P>
Both Slocum and Weekley -- they attended high school together in
Milton, Florida -- had eagles. Slocum got his on No. 3, dropping
a 25-foot putt. Weekley got his on the par-4 12th when his 6-iron
found the hole from 185 yards.
</P>
<P>
Weekley charmed Chinese journalists with his broad, southern
drawl. This is his first visit to the country, and one of few
outside the United States. He said he missed being away for the
traditional American holiday of Thanksgiving and would probably
be deer hunting this weekend if he weren't in China playing golf.
</P>
<P>
Asked what he knew about China, Weekley replied: "Not much. Rice.
Oh yeah, I knew the Great Wall of China but I thought it was
closer."
</P>
<P>
"We ain't been able to do nothing," he added. "We go straight to
the motel and straight here, but I know the people here are
friendly. It's very nice. They always say `hey,' so polite and
stuff. That's always a plus when you show up somewhere in a
foreign country."
</P>
<P>
One journalist suggested the United States was criticized for not
sending its top players.
</P>
<P>
"I thought they sent the best team," Weekley joked.
</P>
<P>
England is the pre-tournament favorite with Justin Rose and Ian
Poulter: it is the only combination of the 28 teams to have both
players ranked in the top 20.
</P>
<P>
The English duo hoped to restore some English pride on a dark day
for the national soccer team, which was beaten at home by Croatia
on Wednesday and failed to qualify for next year's European
championships.
</P>
<P>
Poulter and Rose both dressed in red and white outfits, showing
off the colors of England's national flag even after the soccer
flop.
</P>
<P>
"I definitely wasn't going to wear all-black, that's for sure,"
Poulter said.
</P>
<P>
Although this event dates from 1953 -- Hogan, Snead, Palmer and
Nicklaus have all won it -- it's had trouble getting traction.
After being part of the World Golf Championships (WGC), it was
cut loose after last year and begins a 12-year run at Mission
Hills as an event co-sanctioned by all the major golf tours,
including the United States and Europe.
</P>
<P>
U.S. PGA commissioner Tim Finchem said by moving to a permanent
venue, he hoped the top American players might be attracted to
play -- perhaps including No. 1 Tiger Woods and No. 2 Phil
Mickelson.
</P>
<P>
Even prize money of $1.6 million (euro1.08 million) to the
winning team was not enough to lure players like Woods. The total
prize money is $5 million (euro3.38 million).
</P>
<P>
"The competitors are not members of a labor union; they are not
under contract to play," Finchem said. "They can go and play as
they choose."
</P>
<P>
The last high-profile pair to win the event was Retief Goosen and
Ernie Els in 2001. Woods won in 1999 with Mark O'Meara and a year
later with David Duval.
