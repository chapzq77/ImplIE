Britain's finance minister heads to India
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Britain's finance minister Gordon Brown was set to leave for
India Tuesday for a three-day tour that will be watched closely
at home as he edges towards becoming the country's next prime
minister.
</P>
<P>
The chancellor of the exchequer and his ally, Trade and Industry
Secretary Alistair Darling, were to depart for the sub-continent
Tuesday lunchtime (1300-1400 GMT) with senior British political
reporters in tow.
</P>
<P>
Although the trip is mainly focused on strengthening bilateral
trade links, analysts see Brown's visit as key to preparing the
ground for and gaining experience before his expected promotion
to the top job later this year.
</P>
<P>
Brown -- best known for his careful stewardship of the British
economy -- is widely seen as the man most likely to take over
when Prime Minister Tony Blair leaves office within the next nine
months.
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks, he has strayed beyond his Treasury department
brief in a series of high-profile appearances and speeches, to
demonstrate his grip on wider policy issues and win over public
opinion.
</P>
<P>
They have ranged from domestic issues like education and health
to foreign policy, in particular Britain's controversial presence
in Iraq, to give a flavour of his future premiership.
</P>
<P>
Brown and Darling -- who is himself being tipped to take over the
post of finance minister -- are being accompanied to Mumbai,
Delhi and Bangalore by more than 150 business leaders from more
than 80 British companies.
