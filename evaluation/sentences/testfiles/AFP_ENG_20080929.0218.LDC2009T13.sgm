US digital video recording pioneer TiVo Inc. and Germany's Nero
AG unveiled a product on Monday that allows the popular TiVo
capturing of television shows on a personal computer.

Nero LiquidTV/TiVo PC brings the digital video recording (DVR)
features of TiVo to Windows-equipped PCs, TiVo and Nero said in a
statement.

Users can watch and pause live TV on their desktops, record TV
shows on their hard drive and transfer shows between home
computers, they said.

<P>
TV shows can also be exported to other devices such as Apple
iPods and Sony PlayStations or burned to DVDs.

"With Nero LiquidTV/TiVo PC, we are providing a next-generation
DVR application that integrates the renowned TiVo service with
the PC," said Nero chief executive Udo Eberlein.

The Nero LiquidTV/TiVo PC software can be installed on PCs with
