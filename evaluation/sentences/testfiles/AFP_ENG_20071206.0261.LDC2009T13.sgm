A parcel bomb explosion Thursday at a legal office in central
Paris killed a secretary and seriously injured a lawyer,
investigators said.

<P>
Four other people were hurt in the blast, which went off around
midday on the fourth floor of a building in the capital's
fashionable eighth arrondissement or district.

The building on Boulevard Malesherbes is where President Nicolas
Sarkozy once practised as a lawyer, but there was no suggestion
of a link.

Interior Minister Michele Alliot-Marie left Brussels, where she
was to attend an EU meeting, in order to visit the scene. In a
statement she said she "condemns with the greatest severity this
cowardly and hateful act".

The booby-trap was mailed to a law firm run by attorney Catherine
Gouet- Jenselme, 60, police said. It was opened by her colleague
Olivier Brane, 58, in the presence of his secretary.

Police said there was a second suspect package at the scene which
was not opened.
