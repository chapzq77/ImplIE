IndyMac Bancorp, the California mortgage insurer seized last
month by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., says it will file
for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection.
</P>
<P>
In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Indymac
says it expects the court will appoint a bankruptcy trustee
promptly.

Upon the takeover of IndyMac Bank by the FDIC, it became the
largest regulated thrift, a type of bank that focuses largely on
mortgages and consumer loans, to fail. The seizure prompted
hundreds of angry customers to queue up for hours in Southern
California to demand their money.

<P>
IndyMac's customers had to take a loss on whatever amount they
had in the bank over the $100,000 insurance limits. About 10,000
of IndyMac's 275,000 accounts contained uninsured sums, and
uninsured money made up about $1 billion of the bank's $19
billion in deposits.
