Queens Park Rangers hired Paulo Sousa as manager Wednesday
despite the former Portugal playmaker having no experience in a
top coaching job.
</P>
<P>
Sousa, who signed a 2 1/2 year deal with the League Championship
club, has worked as an assistant coach with the Portuguese
national team for five years under Luiz Felipe Scolari and Carlos
Queiroz.
</P>
<P>
Sousa made 51 international appearances and played for a number
of Europe's leading clubs, including Benfica, Inter Milan,
Juventus and Borussia Dortmund.
</P>
<P>
"I have a great belief in my ideas and my coaching ability and I
firmly believe I can achieve the objectives set by the
management," the 38-year-old Sousa said. "I believe in playing
positive, attacking football. To achieve positive results you
have to maintain a focused outlook and my team will aim to do
this."
</P>
<P>
Gareth Ainsworth, who had been serving as caretaker manager, will
remain on the coaching staff.

<P>
QPR, which plays at Watford on Saturday, is 10th in the 24-team
second-tier league, 15 points behind leader Wolverhampton
Wanderers.

<P>
Lakshmi Mittal, the wealthiest person in Britain, has a stake in
the west London club, along with Formula One head Bernie
Ecclestone and Renault F1 managing director Flavio Briatore.
</P>
<P>
"I have been keeping track of his work for the last few months
and he is the right man for our project," said Briatore, the QPR
chairman. "He has great experience after working with the
Portuguese national team and he is part of the new generation of
coach. He has worked with some of the world's best players and we
are excited about having him.
</P>
<P>
"His football career was highly impressive and he has great
knowledge of the game."
</P>
<P>
QPR was in danger of relegation to League One last season but
rallied strongly to finish 14th under Luigi Di Canio, who
returned home to Italy for personal reasons after only eight
months with the club.

<P>
Iain Dowie was fired in October, just five months into a two-year
contract following the club's inconsistent start to the season.
