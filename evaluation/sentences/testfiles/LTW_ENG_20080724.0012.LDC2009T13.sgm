India's Outstretched Hand: New Delhi Does Its Part to Salvage a
Nuclear Pact; Now It's Congress's Turn

The following editorial appeared in Wednesday's Washington Post:

Until recently, it seemed that an ambitious Bush administration
bid to restore nuclear cooperation between the United States and
India might be dead, a victim of domestic Indian politics. Anti-
American communist parties that support Prime Minister Manmohan
Singh's centrist government were blocking the deal. But Mr. Singh
took a bold risk to salvage the pact, trading communist support
for that of a smaller regional party in hopes of assembling a new
majority. This week the gamble paid off, as Mr. Singh's
government survived a parliamentary no-confidence vote. Now, the
question is whether the pact can survive the American political
process.

There isn't much time; under U.S. law, Congress must be in
session continuously for 30 days to consider the deal. Before
that clock can start, the International Atomic Energy Agency
(IAEA) and the 45-nation Nuclear Suppliers Group must give India
a green light. While those approvals are likely, they won't
happen instantaneously. And because of the long August recess,
there may not be more than 30 "legislative days" left before
Congress adjourns on Sept. 26. The deal raises many legitimate
questions. But, on balance, it is in the United States' interest,
and Congress should find the time to say yes -- in a lame-duck
session after the November election, if necessary.

U.S. nuclear cooperation with India ceased when India, which had
refused to sign the 1968 Non-Proliferation Treaty, exploded a
nuclear "device" in 1974. The sanctions were intended to show
India, and the world, that there was a price to be paid for
flouting the treaty. Times change, though, and the Bush
administration's logic is that the benefits of a "strategic
partnership" with India outweigh the risks of waiving the old
rules. If booming India uses more nuclear energy, it will emit
less in greenhouse gases. Unlike Pakistan, India has developed
its nuclear arsenal without leaking materials or know-how to
others. Perhaps the fact that India is a democracy that shares
not only values but interests -- checking China, fighting
Islamist terrorism -- with the United States matters more than
its signature on a treaty. It's a bet worth making, especially
since the agreement creates more international supervision of
India's nuclear fuel cycle than there would be without it.
</P>

To be sure, it is a risk. The deal weakens the U.S. threat to cut
off uranium if India conducts another nuclear test. India's
economic ties and military-to-military contacts with Iran are
worrisome, as is its stubborn habit of taking "nonaligned"
stances against U.S. interests. But the fact that Mr. Singh
successfully ditched the communists for the sake of closer ties
with Washington is a hopeful sign that the agreement is already
inducing moderation. At this point, if Congress rejects the deal,
the likeliest outcome -- in addition to much ill will in New
Delhi -- is that India, freshly approved as a customer for
technology and fuel by the IAEA and the Suppliers Group, will
simply buy its planned 25,000 megawatts of nuclear capacity from
France or Russia. After much delay, Mr. Singh has done his part;
now it's Congress's turn.
