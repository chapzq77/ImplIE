FRANKFURT, Germany 2008-05-29 10:24:33 UTC

<P>
The proportion of unemployed Germans sank to 7.8 percent in May,
the first time the figure has dipped below 8 percent in 15 years,
the German Federal Employment Office said Thursday .
</P>
<P>
The decline means 131,000 fewer people out of work, bringing the
number of unemployed in Europe's biggest economy to 3.283
million.
</P>
<P>
While the decline was less than anticipated, the general downward
tendency continued, Frank Juergen Weise, director of the office,
told a news conference in Nuremberg.
</P>
<P>
The overall drop is partially credited to a mild winter in which
building projects were able to progress, meaning fewer
construction workers had to register for unemployment claims.
</P>
<P>
"Employment is growing further and the demand for workers from
businesses is moving at a high pace," Weise said.
</P>
<P>
Timo Klein, an economist at Global Insight in Frankfurt, said the
figure looks poised to continue to decline.
</P>
<P>
"Underlying labor market conditions are continuing to improve,
thus supporting consumer demand. This has remained subdued so far
due to inflation fears, but should strengthen once these recede,"
Klein said.
</P>
<P>
Global Insight expects the pace of average monthly declines to
pick up again to some degree during the second half of 2008 --
despite the dampening influence from the overall slowdown in
economic growth.
