Whaling body to hold talks on deadlock in London
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The International Whaling Commission will seek to break a bitter
deadlock between pro- and anti-whaling groups at a meeting in
London this week, a spokesman said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The informal three-day meeting from Thursday comes as Japanese
whalers are locked in a struggle with conservation activists who
threw acid at crew members of a ship participating in Japan's
annual whale hunt in the Southern Ocean.
</P>
<P>
Japan was enraged by Monday's attack and said it would raise the
incident at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Masahiko Komura said it was "not permissible to
use violence to try to force through one's opinion."
</P>
<P>
The London meeting was called by IWC Chairman William Hogarth in
a bid to break the impasse between its pro- and anti-whaling
blocs.
</P>
<P>
Hogarth, an American, helped persuade Japan last year to suspend
its plans to kill humpback whales for the first time in four
decades.
</P>
<P>
Japan says whaling is part of its culture and kills up to 1,000
whales a year, exploiting a loophole in a 1986 global moratorium
that allows "lethal research" on the giant mammals, although the
meat ends up in supermarkets.
</P>
<P>
Australia has stepped up its opposition to whaling under new
Prime Minister Kevin Rudd and has sent a ship to monitor the
Japanese mission, but Canberra condemned the activists' attack
and appealed for restraint from both sides.
</P>
<P>
The agenda of the meeting says the IWC has called in Professor
Calestous Juma of Harvard University, who has experience "in
handling difficult international issues," to try to broker an
agreement between the pro- and anti-whaling lobbies.
</P>
<P>
Juma will make a presentation to the meeting.
