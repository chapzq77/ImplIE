Olympics: China to censor Internet during Games -- organisers
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Foreign reporters will not have complete access to the Internet
during the Beijing Olympics, Games organisers said Wednesday,
reversing a pledge to bring down the Chinese firewall of
censorship.
</P>
<P>
Sites linked to the banned Falungong spiritual movement and other
unspecified ones would remain blocked for the thousands of
foreign reporters covering the Games, organising committee
spokesman Sun Weide told AFP.
</P>
<P>
"During the Olympic Games we will provide sufficient access to
the Internet for reporters," said Sun.
</P>
<P>
However "sufficient" access falls short of the complete Internet
freedoms for foreign reporters that China's communist authorities
had promised in the run-up to the Games, which begin on August 8.
</P>
<P>
The head of the International Olympic Committee's press
commission, Kevan Gosper, told AFP that he would take the matter
up with Chinese officials.
</P>
<P>
"I will speak with the Chinese authorities to advise them of the
restraints and to see what their reaction is," he said.
</P>
<P>
Australian Olympic team chief John Coates, who is also an IOC
member, expressed frustration with the decision to continue to
censor the Internet, pointing out that China had gone back on one
of its "key" Olympic promises.
</P>
<P>
"It certainly is disappointing... I think it's a matter that the
IOC will take seriously," Coates told reporters at the main press
centre for the Games here where sensitive Internet sites remained
blocked.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with AFP two weeks ago, Rogge insisted
that there would be no censorship of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
"For the first time, foreign media will be able to report freely
and publish their work freely in China," he said.
</P>
<P>
"There will be no censorship on the Internet."
</P>
<P>
However Sun said China's pledge was only to allow foreign
reporters enough information to carry out their duties to cover
the Games, not to have unfettered Internet access.
</P>
<P>
"Our promise was that journalists would be able to use the
Internet for their work during the Olympic Games," he said. "So
we have given them sufficient access to do that."
</P>
<P>
Falungong is a particularly sensitive issue for China's communist
authorities, who outlawed the group in 1999, describing it as an
evil cult.
</P>
<P>
Sun would not say which other sites would remain censored for
foreign reporters.
</P>
<P>
But journalists working at the main press centre for the Olympics
could not access a wide range of sites on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
When AFP accessed the Internet through the wireless system at the
centre, a wide range of sites considered sensitive by the Chinese
government were blocked.
</P>
<P>
These included sites for Amnesty International, the Tibet
government-in-exile, dissidents, and ones giving information
about the 1989 Tiananmen massacre in which the Chinese military
crushed democracy protests.
</P>
<P>
Chinese authorities operate strict Internet censorship with a so-
called "Great Firewall of China" that blocks information the
Communist Party views as improper, unhealthy or a threat to its
rule.
</P>
<P>
Amnesty describes China as one of the world's "enemies of the
Internet".
</P>
<P>
Last year China introduced new regulations relaxing general media
curbs for foreign journalists in the run-up to the Games.
</P>
<P>
However, domestic journalists, who work under strict censorship,
were not included in the measures to relax reporting
restrictions, nor were they promised any greater Internet
freedoms during the Games.
