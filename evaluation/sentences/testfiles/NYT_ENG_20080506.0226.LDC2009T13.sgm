EVACUATION ORDERED AS CHILEAN VOLCANO BEGINS TO SPEW ASH

SANTIAGO, Chile

The Chaiten volcano in southern Chile blasted ash and what
appeared to be lava a dozen miles into the air on Tuesday,
leading the government to order the immediate and complete
evacuation of everyone living within a 30-mile radius of it.
</P>
<P>
Preceded by dozens of tremors, the volcano -- until now
considered inactive -- began erupting last Friday. It covered
about 60 square miles with more than 15 inches of ash, rendering
the air unbreathable, contaminating water sources, killing
livestock and destroying all small- and medium-scale agriculture
in this rural and mostly impoverished area 800 miles south of the
capital, Santiago.
</P>
<P>
An enormous gray mushroom cloud of ash that could be seen from
100 miles away has since loomed over this sliver of land next to
Argentina, where continental Chile breaks up into archipelagos.
East winds have spread ash toward Argentina. The thick layer of
volcanic ash, coupled with rain, has made access to the sparsely
populated border zone difficult.

President Michelle Bachelet visited the area on Monday,
announcing subsidies and other aid for affected families. On
Tuesday, she convened an emergency committee of government
ministers, emergency agency representatives, the director of the
police force and regional officials.
</P>
<P>
The committee resolved to order the total evacuation of Chaiten,
to authorize the release of emergency funds and to appoint
Defense Minister Jose Goni to coordinate the response to the
natural disaster.
</P>
<P>
"The situation is rather complicated," said Interior Minister
Edmundo Perez. "The volcano continues erupting, and we don't know
how long this will last. It could be a day, a week or more."
</P>
<P>
About 8,000 residents of nearby towns have been evacuated since
the weekend. There have been no deaths or injuries reported,
although a 92-year-old woman died of a heart attack as she was
evacuated from Chaiten on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
After flying over the area on Tuesday morning, specialists from
the National Geology and Mining Service said that they had found
no evidence of lava flowing from the volcano, although they were
able to see lava at the base of the large crater. This is the
first time the Chaiten volcano has erupted in at least 2,000
years, according to service officials.
</P>
<P>
Since the weekend, the military, navy and police have helped ship
out several thousand residents from Chaiten, situated only six
miles away from the base of the volcano and near the Chaiten Bay.
About 20 families are still refusing to leave their homes,
animals and belongings in spite of the presidential order, which
makes no exceptions for military, police or journalists.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, hundreds of residents in Futaleufu, just miles from
the border, were being evacuated voluntarily by bus, crossing
over to Argentina for part of the journey.
</P>
<P>
About 25,000 head of cattle and sheep are at imminent risk of
dying, eating plants and drinking water contaminated by volcanic
ash. The navy has shipped feed, and some animals have also been
evacuated to uncontaminated areas. Some civil engineers said they
believed that the soil and plant life in the area may not recover
for several decades, if at all.
</P>
<P>
"The soil in the area covered by this volume of ash deposits will
be practically lost," said Wilfredo Vera, engineer from the
University of Chile. He told a Chilean radio station that
"agricultural production will be virtually nil."
