Olivant reveals Northern Rock rescue plan as Flowers reportedly
drops bid

LONDON 2007-12-07 17:38:36 UTC
</P>
<P>
British investment group Olivant came forward with a detailed
rescue offer for mortgage lender Northern Rock PLC on Friday as
U.S. investment firm JC Flowers reportedly pulled out of the
bidding process.
</P>
<P>
The offer from Olivant, which includes immediately repaying up to
15 billion pounds (US$30.5 billion; euro20.96 billion) of the
government funds propping up Northern Rock, could be a strong
contender to the current preferred bid from Richard Branson's
Virgin Group.
</P>
<P>
Olivant chief Luqman Arnold, a buyout veteran, said he was
confident his proposal would win favor with the government and
shareholders.
</P>
<P>
"The government has indicated its complete openness to any
proposals that address the issues and the needs," he said. "Our
proposal is simpler, smoother and quicker."
</P>
<P>
Shares in Northern Rock jumped 7.4 percent to close at 110.6
pence (US$2.24; euro1.53) on the London Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
Olivant plans to take over management of the mortgage lender in
return for a 15 percent stake, developing the company as "a
strong, independent brand" under the Northern Rock name. The
outstanding value of a series of loans from the Bank of England
would be repaid by 2009, it added.
</P>
<P>
The Virgin consortium proposes to re-brand Northern Rock as part
of the Virgin Money business and take a 55 percent stake in the
bank. It has said it would repay 11 billion pounds (euro15.3
billion; US$22.7 billion) of the Bank of England debt
immediately.
</P>
<P>
Olivant outlined its offer as JC Flowers reportedly pulled out of
contention. The U.S. buyout firm sent letters to the Treasury
notifying officials of its position, according to the Financial
Times and Daily Telegraph.
</P>
<P>
Flowers did not immediately return a call.
</P>
<P>
Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods analysts said in a note that the
proposal looks more attractive than Virgin's, but Collins Stewart
analyst Alex Potter said that the Olivant approach was short on
detail.
</P>
<P>
Olivant's plan calls for a Northern Rock to raise between 600
million pounds to 800 million pounds (US$1.22 billion to US$1.62
billion; euro833 million to euro1.11 billion) in equity capital
through a transferable rights issue and an equity subscription by
Olivant.
</P>
<P>
The rights issue would raise between 450 million pounds and 650
million pounds (US$915.2 million and US$1.3 billion; euro628.8
million and euro890 million) at or around the prevailing market
price at the time of subscription, while the equity subscription
of 150 million pounds (US$305 million; euro209 million) would be
made by Olivant on completion of the rights issue and at a price
equal to the rights issue subscription price.
</P>
<P>
Arnold would join the Northern Rock board as executive chairman
until full repayment of the Bank of England facility has been
completed, while Kirk Stephenson, chief operating officer of
Olivant, would become a non-executive director.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission gave the bidding process some fresh
oxygen earlier this week by clearing the state aid that kept
Northern Rock afloat after it fell victim to the global credit
crisis. After declining to reveal specifics for weeks, Northern
Rock said on Thursday that it had so far borrowed 25 billion
pounds (US$50.8 billion; euro34.9 billion).
</P>
<P>
Northern Rock ran into trouble in September when short-term money
markets dried up following the collapse of the U.S. subprime
mortgage market. Heavily reliant on funding from those markets,
Northern Rock approached the Bank of England for an emergency
loan.
</P>
<P>
As spooked customers made a run on the bank to retrieve their
savings, the government also announced it would guarantee all
personal funds held by the lender up to 35,000 pounds (US$70,900;
euro48,100).
</P>
<P>
That package of loans and deposit guarantees needed approval from
the EU, which allows certain forms of emergency aid for a limited
period of up to six months.
</P>
<P>
The EU said on Wednesday that the assistance to that point was
legal, but withheld any decision on future aid.
