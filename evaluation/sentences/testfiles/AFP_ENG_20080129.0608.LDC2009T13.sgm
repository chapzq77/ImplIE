Cricket: 'Exhausted' Tait quits cricket
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Australian fast bowler Shaun Tait on Tuesday quit all levels of
cricket due to physical and emotional exhaustion.
</P>
<P>
Tait, 24, has struggled with injury since shortly after being
named to the Australian Test eleven midway through its
unsuccessful Ashes tour of England in 2005.
</P>
<P>
He has played only three Tests, the last being against India in
Perth this month during which he took no wickets. India won the
match by 72 runs.
</P>
<P>
Tait, who was named the International Cricket Council's emerging
player of 2007, said it had been a difficult decision to take a
break from the game.
</P>
<P>
"This is not an overnight decision but something that I've been
struggling with for sometime," he said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"A break from professional cricket will hopefully give me a clear
mind and a chance for my body to rest and recover.
</P>
<P>
"My love and enjoyment of the game is struggling due to these
issues and if I continue to go on, it will be unfair on my team
mates and support staff of both the Australian and South
Australian cricket teams -- and most importantly my family and
close friends."
</P>
<P>
Cricket Australia said Tait was suffering from "physical and
emotional exhaustion and will be rested from cricket while he
undergoes a programme designed to facilitate his return to
cricket."
</P>
<P>
Tait has suffered recurrent injuries dating back to 2005 and
undergone surgery to his shoulder and elbow. He also has
intermittent pain from back and hamstring injuries.
</P>
<P>
"The combination of his injury history and the demands of being
an elite professional cricketer has affected his physical, and
significantly, his emotional well being," South Australian
Cricket Association medical officer Terry Farquharson said.
</P>
<P>
"Shaun feels he needs a rest from cricket and I support this,
which will allow him to recover both physically and emotionally."
</P>
<P>
Cricket Australia's Chief medical officer Dr Trefor James said it
was clear that Tait needed a break from cricket at all levels.
</P>
<P>
"We'll be working with Shaun going forward to ensure that
whatever assistance he requires is provided to him," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Shaun's personal welfare is our primary concern as well as his
return to cricket at an appropriate point."
