The White House said Monday that Israel was not looking to
"retake" the Gaza Strip through its military operations against
Hamas and was only acting to defend its citizens.

"They are taking the steps that they feel are necessary to deal
with the terrorist threat," said spokesman Gordon Johndroe, who
cited public Israeli "statements saying that they don't want to
retake Gaza, that they simply want to protect their people."

Johndroe later clarified that Israeli officials had made private
assurances to the United States that they were not looking to
seize the territory.
