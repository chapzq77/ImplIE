Russian forces in final pullback in Georgia

KARALETI, Georgia 2008-10-08 12:18:20 UTC

<P>
Russian forces pulled back Wednesday from positions outside South
Ossetia, bulldozing a camp at a key checkpoint and withdrawing
into the separatist region as European Union monitors and
relieved Georgian residents looked on.
</P>
<P>
Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, speaking in France, said
Russian forces would leave areas in Georgia around South Ossetia
and Abkhazia, another separatist region, by midnight.
</P>
<P>
Dozens of armored personnel carriers, military trucks and
transport vehicles rolled north through the Russian-established
buffer zone and entered South Ossetia. Georgians, frightened by
weeks of arson and looting blamed on Russia's South Ossetian
allies, lined the road to watch.
</P>
<P>
"Now I feel safe; I hope that life will improve," said Meri
Khokhashvili, standing outside her destroyed home in the village
of Kitsnisi. She said she and her husband have lived in the
cellar since uniformed soldiers burned down their house in mid-
August after the war.
</P>
<P>
Russia must withdraw from buffer zones abutting South Ossetia and
Abkhazia by Friday under cease-fire agreements brokered by French
President Nicolas Sarkozy.
</P>
<P>
Western countries have condemned Russia's invasion of Georgia and
its recognition of South Ossetia and Abkhazia as independent
nations. Russia plans to keep nearly 4,000 troops in each of the
separatist regions -- plans the U.S., European Union and NATO say
violate a cease-fire commitment to withdraw to pre-conflict
positions.
</P>
<P>
Near the village of Karaleti outside South Ossetia on Wednesday,
Russian troops dismantled a camp and a roadblock separating the
buffer zone from Georgian-controlled territory, leaving nothing
but a broken tractor. Two bulldozers leveled the ground and
Russian soldiers swept for mines before leaving.
</P>
<P>
Two armored personnel carriers headed toward South Ossetia
shortly after the chief of Russian peacekeeping troops in the
region, Maj. Gen. Marat Kulakhmetov, said the withdrawal from six
Russian posts at the edge of the buffer zone would be finished by
day's end.
</P>
<P>
As they moved north they were joined by dozens of other Russian
military vehicles, forming a loose column that crossed into South
Ossetia about an hour later. The vehicles were accompanied as far
as the border by two blue light-armored vehicles from the EU
mission monitoring the pullout.
</P>
<P>
The governor of the Georgian region where Karaleti is located,
Vladimir Vardezelashvili, said Georgian police would move in as
the Russians withdraw. A white pickup truck packed with black-
uniformed police carrying Kalashnikovs crossed the former
checkpoint.
</P>
<P>
EU monitors have been patrolling the buffer zone since Oct. 1
under the withdrawal agreement, a supplement to the initial
cease-fire Sarkozy negotiated on behalf of the EU in August.
Russia has made clear the EU monitors are not welcome in the
breakaway regions themselves.
</P>
<P>
The head of the EU monitoring mission, Hansjorg Haber, expressed
satisfaction with the Russian moves to withdraw.
</P>
<P>
"We always proceeded from the assumption that the process would
be completed by Friday, and this is confirmation of that
assumption," Haber told The Associated Press by telephone from
buffer zone outside Abkhazia, where he said there were 12
checkpoints and a base that needed to be evacuated.
</P>
<P>
The war erupted Aug. 7, when Georgian forces attacked Tskhinvali,
the capital of South Ossetia, which broke away in a war during
the early 1990s. Russian troops, tanks and warplanes repelled the
attack and drove deep into Georgia in Russia's first major
military offensive beyond its borders since the 1991 Soviet
collapse.
</P>
<P>
Russian forces occupied large portions of Georgia for weeks after
the war and reinforced positions around the edges of South
Ossetia and Abkhazia.
</P>
<P>
The war broke out after years of increasing tension between
Russia and Georgia, whose pro-Western President Mikhail
Saakashvili has cultivated ties with Washington and pushed to
join NATO. Georgia straddles a key westward route for oil and gas
from the Caspian Sea region, and has become a focus of
competition between Russia and the West for regional clout.
