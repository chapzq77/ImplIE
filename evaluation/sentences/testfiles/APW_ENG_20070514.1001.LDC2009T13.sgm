Dow Chemical joint ventures expanding in China, Saudi Arabia

Dow Chemical Co. said Monday it plans to build multibillion-
dollar production complexes in Saudi Arabia and China by entering
into pacts with large energy companies in those nations.
</P>
<P>
Dow Chemical has signed an agreement with Saudi Aramco, the
world's largest supplier of energy, to enter into the final
negotiation phase for the formation of a joint venture to build,
own and operate a "world-scale" chemicals and plastics production
complex near Ras Tanura in Saudi Arabia's Eastern Province.
</P>
<P>
The Ras Tanura petrochemical joint venture would take years to
complete and be operationally integrated with Saudi Aramco's Ras
Tanura refinery complex and its Ju'aymah gas-processing plant,
which would supply raw materials to be used in production at the
new facility, Midland-based Dow said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The new business would produce a broad range of products,
including ethylene and propylene, the building blocks used in the
production of various plastics and chemical products.
</P>
<P>
"These are basic chemicals that you use to make either commodity
products or specialty products," Andrew N. Liveris, Dow's
president and chief executive, said in a telephone interview from
London. "That's the unusual part of the Aramco-Dow joint venture
-- that we're going to actually put in place an ability to make
our specialty products as well."
</P>
<P>
The massive project would help expand Saudi Arabia's economic
base, create jobs and promote economic diversification in the
country, said Abdallah S. Jum'ah, president and CEO of Saudi
Aramco.
</P>
<P>
Dow and the Shenhua Group of China were to sign a cooperation
agreement for conducting a detailed, two-year feasibility study
for building a coal-to-chemicals complex in China's Shaanxi
Province.
</P>
<P>
The project would use "clean coal" technologies that convert coal
to methanol to produce basic products such as ethylene and
propylene, as well as other derivative products.
</P>
<P>
Liveris said the project is in line with Dow's strategy to
improve its competitive position in Asia "with locally produced
products and solutions."
</P>
<P>
"The building of the world-scale coal chemical plant jointly with
Dow will make full use of the respective advantages of the two
companies," said Chen Biting, chairman of Shenhua Group. "It is
of great significance for the world to produce the oil substitute
converted from coal and it is the case for China in particular."
</P>
<P>
The feasibility study is expected to take about two years. The
two companies then would put together a project-application
report for submission to the Chinese government for approval.
</P>
<P>
Liveris declined to say how much money Dow planned to spend on
the two projects other than to describe the Saudi Aramco project
as the larger of the two and that each would cost "multiple
billions of dollars."
