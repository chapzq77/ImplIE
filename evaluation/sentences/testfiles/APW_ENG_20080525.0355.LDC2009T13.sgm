Military rulers silent on Suu Kyi ' s detention deadline as
donors gather in Myanmar

The deadline for pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi's house
arrest expires this week, but Myanmar's military rulers remained
silent about her fate Sunday as international donors pushed
politics aside to help suffering cyclone victims.
</P>
<P>
The detention of Nobel Peace Prize laureate Suu Kyi has been at
the center of friction between the secretive junta and many
countries around the world, who have tirelessly campaigned for
her release. She was last put under house arrest in May 2003, and
the term has been renewed every year since.
</P>
<P>
But this year's deadline comes at a critical point. Under Myanmar
law, no one can be held longer than five years without being
released or put on trial, said U.S. lawyer Jared Genser, hired by
Suu Kyi's family to push for her release.
</P>
<P>
It remained unclear what action, if any, the regime would take as
the world focuses on the Southeast Asian country still reeling
from Cyclone Nargis. The storm killed 78,000 people three weeks
ago and left another 2.4 million people homeless and facing
hunger and disease.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and representatives from 50
nations met Sunday for a one-day fundraising conference in
Myanmar's biggest city, Yangon. The donors have agreed, at least
for now, to focus on the humanitarian relief effort.
</P>
<P>
"We must think about people just now, not politics," Ban told the
conference.
</P>
<P>
The junta has made it nearly impossible for foreign aid agencies
to get access to the Irrawaddy Delta -- where the cyclone damage
was worst -- but the country's ruling general promised Ban on
Friday that those restrictions would be lifted. The government
has estimated the economic damage at about US$11 billion (euro7
billion).
</P>
<P>
"Their failure to abide by their own law by refusing to release
(Suu Kyi) ... is a clear slap in the face to Ban Ki-moon and the
ASEAN diplomats and others coming into town," Genser said,
referring to the member countries of the Association of Southeast
Asian Nations. "They are out of time to hold her under their own
law."
</P>
<P>
Genser, of U.S.-based Freedom Now, which represents pro-democracy
dissidents in a number of countries, said Suu Kyi's house arrest
expired at midnight Saturday. But Nyan Win, spokesman for her
opposition National League of Democracy party, said it would not
officially be up until Monday, adding there had been "no sign at
all" indicating what the government will do.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, the government held the second phase of a referendum
vote for a proposed military-backed constitution that had already
won overwhelming support and is largely considered a sham by the
international community. One provision would prohibit Suu Kyi
from holding public office. The military refused to accept the
results of a general election in 1990 won by her party.
</P>
<P>
Suu Kyi has lived under house arrest for about 12 of the past 18
years for leading an internationally hailed movement for
democracy in Myanmar, which has been ruled by the military with
an iron fist since 1962.
