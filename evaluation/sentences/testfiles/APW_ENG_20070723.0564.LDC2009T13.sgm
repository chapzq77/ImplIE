EU warns Austria it can ' t ban heavy trucks using Alpine highway

EU regulators on Monday warned Austria that it cannot ban heavy
trucks from an Alpine highway linking the country with Germany.
</P>
<P>
Authorities in the Tyrol want to stop heavy lorries traveling
through the Inn valley in an effort to limit nitrogen dioxide
emissions from road transport. The proposed ban would cover any
truck carrying waste, grain, timber, stones, rubble, cars, steel
and ceramic tiles.
</P>
<P>
But the European Commission said that would break EU rules
guaranteeing the free movement of goods anywhere in the 27-nation
bloc. The transport of these goods could not easily switch to
rail freight, it said, and the ban would not hugely improve air
quality.
</P>
<P>
Austria has been trying for years to control polluting truck
traffic through its territory, a vital link for truckers bringing
goods between the industrial heartland of Germany and markets in
Italy and parts of Eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, the EU's highest court ruled against a similar ban
on the same A12 highway, saying it went too far and Austria
should have tried softer measures first.
</P>
<P>
The EU executive said it would support environmental laws banning
older or more polluting lorries or introducing speed limits for
cars -- words meant for Germany where highways have no upper
speed limit.
