Japanese police said Friday they had arrested three employees of
Yamaha Motor Co. for allegedly attempting to export to China a
helicopter with potential military uses.

The three employees, who include Kazuo Uchiyama, senior general
manager of aeronautic operations, are suspected of attempting to
export an unmanned helicopter to a Chinese aerial photography
company in December 2005 without approval from the trade
ministry, a police spokesman said.

The trade ministry in December 2005 conducted an on-site
inspection of Yamaha Motor and spotted the alleged attempted
export of the unmanned helicopter to Beijing BVE Technology Co.,
a trade ministry official said.

As Yamaha denied the allegations, the ministry submitted the
allegations to the police, he said.

Police raided the Yamaha headquarter in January 2006 on suspicion
of violating the foreign exchange law which requires governmental

helicopters to China in 2005 or earlier without governmental
