KIDCENTRIC BUSINESSES BUSTING OUT ALL OVER
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
She was a one-woman sales force, and her store was a diaper bag,
from which she sold BabyLegs anywhere moms congregated:
playgrounds, coffee shops, consignment stores.
</P>
<P>
"If they like something, they'll tell all the other moms about
it," Donnelly said. "Women are social, and that has really
benefited our business."
</P>
<P>
Before long, Donnelly had a factory supplier in China and moved
from the kitchen of her two-bedroom apartment into a 3,500
-square-foot office and warehouse in South Seattle.
</P>
<P>
Now babies and children all around the world sport BabyLegs;
Donnelly sells several thousand $12 pairs every day.
</P>
<P>
The inspirations for "mamapreneurs" like Donnelly to start a
business are many, but often they see an unmet need and fill it.
</P>
<P>
In Seattle, newish moms are behind the hip baby-gear store,
Tottini, in South Lake Union, as well as the local online
resource, Red Tricycle, and the organic baby food delivery
service, Sprouts.
</P>
<P>
While many a new mom struggles to meet all of the demands in her
life and feels that some days a mere shower is a luxury, another
breed decides that, between feedings, changings and naps, it's
time to start a business.
</P>
<P>
So they become a mamapreneur, blending parenthood with
entrepreneurship, usually by creating a baby- or child-centric
business or product. The phenomenon is exploding all over the
country, coinciding with a demand for stylish children's gear and
a wave of older first-time parents who have more disposable
income to spend on their kids.
</P>
<P>
Many a mamapreneur has never owned or run a business before, but
applies her former job skills while learning the rest on the job.
They often rely on word of mouth through the mama grapevine to
get exposure.
</P>
<P>
No one knows the number of mamapreneurs out there, but one-woman
businesses -- which many moms fall into -- grew at twice the rate
of all other businesses between 1997 and 2004, according to the
Center for Women's Business Research.
</P>
<P>
Victoria Colligan says that about half of the 30,000 subscribers
to Ladies Who Launch, an online network for entrepreneurs that
she co-founded, are mothers with young children.
</P>
<P>
"We see a lot of women realizing when they have a baby that they
don't want the corporate lifestyle they had previously, yet they
want to be inspired and make money and do something," said
Colligan, who has two young children. "A lot of businesses are
born during naptime."
</P>
<P>
She said the No. 1 reason women start businesses is for
flexibility and control, followed by passion and money.
</P>
<P>
But they tend to launch differently from men, she added, starting
lower-risk businesses with small amounts of capital and lighter
overhead.
</P>
<P>
That was true for Donnelly, who incorporated in the summer of
2005 with $8,000 borrowed from her mother and relatives. She now
has 16 employees; about 60 e-tailers and 740 stores sell
BabyLegs.
</P>
<P>
Cause Haun started See Kai Run as a sideline while she worked at
an education foundation. When her son, Kai, then a year old, was
given baby shoes with super-flexible rubber soles during a family
trip to China, Haun brought some samples home and showed them to
a few Seattle stores.
</P>
<P>
"It was just a fun idea to make a little money," said Haun, who
has a degree in international business. "But the reaction was so
strong that we got excited."
</P>
<P>
So she and her husband, Gang Chen, found a small manufacturer
with a modest order requirement to keep the initial investment
and risk low.
</P>
<P>
The business started in late 2004 and experienced 400 percent
growth in a year. See Kai Run shoes were first sold in Seattle,
and are now sold by 800 retailers across the country. At first,
the couple ran the company out of their Rainier Beach home, but
they now have a Woodinville office and six employees, as well as
a second son.
</P>
<P>
"It's a business that you feel is very integrated into your
family, so there isn't a disconnect," said Haun, 36. "I mean, Kai
would run to meet the UPS man when we got home."
</P>
<P>
Many mama-run businesses are smaller and run entirely out of the
home, where there might be crying, babbling or happy shrieks in
the background. Running a child-focused company gives moms a
world outside of, but still connected to, mashed peas and play
dates.
</P>
<P>
Meredith Stinson had tried several of the seemingly infinite
number of baby carriers available, but couldn't find one in a
print she liked. So her friend Crystal Hamilton, a new mom as
well as a designer and seamstress, said, "Let's make one."
</P>
<P>
"We were just going to do a small hobby for friends and baby
showers, and before we knew it we had five seamstresses working
for us," Stinson said.
</P>
<P>
A few well-placed mentions, including one in The Wall Street
Journal, increased orders from a few a week to several hundred.
</P>
<P>
But there were long hours and lots to learn, such as finding a
source for wholesale fabric. "Sometimes we were like, 'What were
we thinking?' We were so na?ve," Stinson said.
</P>
<P>
The business didn't make money for the first two years and
Stinson and Hamilton now take home less money than they did in
previous jobs. Stinson also said she misses having co-workers in
the next cubicle, but her satisfaction is greater.
</P>
<P>
"I'm doing things I never thought I'd be doing before. I never
thought I'd be talking to trademark lawyers. I never thought I'd
be talking to women in Switzerland about what patterns work best
for them," said Stinson, a former event planner and concert
manager.
</P>
<P>
Gina Hadley, a former New York advertising executive, had an idea
for a play space for kids that integrated adults and didn't feel
too kiddie. At a dinner party she met Jeanna Peterson, a
Microsoft product manager, and the two talked about how great
such a place would be.
</P>
<P>
Peterson quit her job and she and Hadley started Urban Monkeys,
an 8,800-square-foot family center in South Lake Union with
classes -- for kids and adults -- in things like creative dance,
yoga and nutrition. They also offer baby-sitting and massage
therapy.
</P>
<P>
"Nobody was speaking to this urban constituency," Hadley said,
"especially women who are or were urban professionals."
</P>
<P>
Urban Monkeys has about 225 families enrolled and the founders
are looking into licensing the idea.
</P>
<P>
Nyro Murphy was simply looking to get out of the house when she
went to a new moms' group, but she began chatting with another
mom, Kelly Buck, about a lack of chic maternity wear in town. So
they opened Bump, a Roosevelt area boutique for hip mothers-to-
be. Now, each works three days a week and they share a nanny.
</P>
<P>
"We fantasized about having our children at the store, but while
you're trying to help some woman try on 10 different outfits, you
have a crying baby," said Murphy, a former counselor. "It just
doesn't work."
</P>
<P>
Buck, a former attorney, also owns Pop Tots, a store with vintage
and unusual kids' clothing.
</P>
<P>
"I'm a better mother, I think, to have something of my own," said
Buck, who is pregnant with her second child.
</P>
<P>
Mamapreneurs are good at spreading the love. Bump sells the wares
of other local moms, including the All Weather Woobee, a plush
blanket with a water-resistant side.
</P>
<P>
Its creator, Heather Correa, in turn, hired another mom with
young kids to design and maintain her Web site, and a friend of
hers who's a new mom did the photography. She also has the Woobee
made in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
Correa seeded her small business with tip money from waiting
tables at Ray's Boathouse. Giving the blanket to celebrities,
including Angela Bassett and Tia Carrere at a recent pre-Golden
Globes event, helped create buzz.
</P>
<P>
Correa still waits tables as her husband transitions to a new
career, and she's sometimes exhausted from her multiple roles.
</P>
<P>
"I was crazy. I think there's special institutions for mothers
who take this on," said Correa, who has lots of energy
supplemented by caffeine. "Part of it was ignorance. If I had
known everything, I don't know that I would have taken this on."
</P>
<P>
But it's rewarding, and she hopes to share the company with her
two daughters one day, whether through money for a college fund,
or teaching them about business.
