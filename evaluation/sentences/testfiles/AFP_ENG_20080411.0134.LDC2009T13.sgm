Basketball: Sentence delayed for NBA referee who aided gamblers
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tim Donaghy, the National Basketball Association refereee who
admitted passing along information to gamblers, has had his
sentencing delayed for a third time.The Philadelphia Inquirer
reported Friday that Donaghy will not learn his fate until May 30
after pleading guilty last August to providing gamblers with
confidential NBA information.
</P>
<P>
His sentence hearing, first set for November, was delayed to
January 25, then next Friday and now next month.
</P>
<P>
Donaghy, 41, faces up to 25 years in prison. He has been free on
250,000-dollars bond since resigning from the NBA on July 9.
</P>
<P>
He is expected to testify in a trial involving two friends
charged in connection with the betting scheme. The trial of James
Battista and Thomas Martino is expected to start on April 28.
</P>
<P>
An FBI investigation uncovered information that led to Donaghy
being charged with betting on NBA games, possibly even some of
the 139 regular-season games and eight playoff games that he
officiated in the 2005-06 and 2006-07 seasons.
</P>
<P>
He was also charged with providing gamblers information about
such things as which referees would officiate what games, things
not even teams knew until just before games.
</P>
<P>
NBA commissioner David Stern called the scandal the "worst
situation I have ever experienced" in his job and toughened
background checks on referees as a reuslt while insisting Donaghy
was the only official involved, a "rogue" rather than a symbol of
corruption that could have crushed the credibility of NBA
results.
