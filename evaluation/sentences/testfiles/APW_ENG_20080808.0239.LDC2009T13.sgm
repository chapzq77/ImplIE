China Eastern Airlines saw its shares tumble 3.7 percent early
Friday following reports that it would not resume talks with
Singapore Airlines about a possible stake sale.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai-based airline's board secretary, Luo Zhuping,
refused comment on the reports that the two sides were not
planning further talks before an earlier agreement between them
expires on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"Don't believe any reporters' guesses. What I can guarantee you
is that we would make an official announcement if any decision
comes," Luo said.
</P>
<P>
Like many in China, Luo's focus was on the big event of the day
-- the opening of the Beijing Olympic games Friday evening.
</P>
<P>
"Besides, I don't want to comment on it during the Olympics," he
added.
</P>
<P>
China Eastern agreed last year to sell a 24 percent stake to
Singapore Airlines and Temasek Holdings, the Singaporean
government investment arm. That deal was rejected by China
Eastern's minority shareholders after state-owned China National
Aviation Holding Co., parent company of Beijing's flag carrier
Air China, offered more money. But that deal was not completed
either.
</P>
<P>
Reports last week said that China Eastern and the Singaporean
consortium planned to resume talks. A Singapore Airlines
spokesman confirmed that the two airlines, which have other
cooperative arrangements, were in contact.
</P>
<P>
China Eastern's shares were at 7.34 yuan by midday Friday, down
3.7 percent. Other airlines' shares also tumbled amid a raft of
negative news about the worldwide airline industry, which is
struggling with high fuel prices and slackening passenger demand.
</P>
<P>
Air China fell 4.2 percent to 9.25 yuan in morning trading. China
Southern Airlines lost 3.6 percent to 7.24 yuan.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, China Eastern announced it plans to invest in
business jet services to cater to China's rapidly expanding
executive travel sector. No specific details were released about
that plan, which would require government approval.
