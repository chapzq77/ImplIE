EU concerned over slow reponse of credit ratings agencies
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The European Commission said Thursday it will investigate how
credit ratings agencies operate, amid growing concern over their
slow response to the US subprime mortgage crisis which has sent
markets tumbling worldwide.
</P>
<P>
"The commission is going to be looking at the issue of credit
ratings agencies, perticularly as they relate to the ratings of
structured products," said spokeswoman Antonia Mochan.
</P>
<P>
The EU executive's wide-ranging enquiries will concentrate on the
governance of the agencies, their management of conflicts of
interests, their resourcing and their ratings performance, Mochan
added.
</P>
<P>
The latter point is of particular interest to the EU "in regards
to concerns we have over their apparent slowness in responding to
material market evidence of deterioration since mid-2006," she
said.
</P>
<P>
The review would not be completed before April 2008, she added.
</P>
<P>
"We have a general eye on market developments, including
regulatory supervision and hedge funds," the Commission
spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
EU Internal Market Commissioner Charlie McCreevy has written to
the chairman of the Committee of European Security Regulators
seeking a meeting with him next month, she added.
</P>
<P>
McCreevy met one of the agencies last month and raised some
issues with them, Mochan said.
</P>
<P>
That agency is believed to be Standard and Poor's.
