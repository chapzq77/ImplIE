Pope Benedict XVI, who riled Muslims over his comments on Islam
and violence, met for the first time Tuesday with the monarch of
Saudi Arabia, which has been pressed by the Vatican to allow
freedom of worship for Christians.
</P>
<P>
Benedict warmly greeted King Abdullah, grasping both his hands
before heading into 30 minutes of private talks in his library.
</P>
<P>
The Vatican said Abdullah had requested the audience during his
European tour. He had visited the Vatican twice before, as crown
prince and deputy prime minister of the oil power.
</P>
<P>
Benedict has said he wants to reach out to all countries that
still don't have diplomatic relations with the Holy See; they
include Saudi Arabia and China. At the same time, Benedict and
other Vatican officials have often protested that Christians are
unable to worship openly in Saudi Arabia and are barred from
opening churches in the desert kingdom.
</P>
<P>
The Vatican newspaper L'Osservatore Romano said the Holy See
hoped the meeting would produce a frank dialogue between the two
sides over the issue, noting that there are more than 1 million
Christian guest workers in Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
At the end of the meeting, Abdullah presented Benedict with a
traditional Middle Eastern gift -- a golden sword studded with
jewels -- as well as a gold and silver statue of a palm tree and
man riding a camel.
</P>
<P>
The pope admired the statue but merely touched the sword.
</P>
<P>
Benedict sparked anger in the Muslim world in 2006 when he
delivered a speech linking Islam to violence. He said he was
misunderstood and regretted offending Muslims. Since then, he has
met a number of Islamic leaders and a year ago visited
predominantly Muslim Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The Vatican has said it wants to pursue a dialogue with moderate
Muslims.
