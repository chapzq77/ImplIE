Oil prices rise as consumer spending report suggests US economy
is weathering the credit storm

NEW YORK 2007-12-21 15:13:25 UTC
</P>
<P>
Oil prices rose Friday after the government reported that
consumer spending surged last month, raising hopes that the U.S.
economy will weather the crisis roiling credit markets and that
demand for oil and gasoline will strengthen.
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department said consumer spending jumped 1.1 percent
in November, the biggest one-month gain since 2004 and well above
analyst expectations for an 0.7 percent increase.
</P>
<P>
That news countered Thursday's report from the Conference Board
that its index of leading indicators dropped 0.4 percent in
November to the lowest level in more than two years, suggesting
the economy was headed for a slowdown.
</P>
<P>
Light, sweet crude for February delivery rose 67 cents to $91.73
on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
</P>
<P>
A slightly weaker dollar also supported oil prices Friday. Oil
futures offer a hedge against a weak dollar, and oil futures
bought and sold in dollars are more attractive to foreign
investors when the greenback is falling. Many observers blame
oil's rise last month to near $100 on speculators driven to oil
futures by the weaker dollar.
</P>
<P>
While oil prices were higher Friday, trading volumes ahead of the
holidays were low. A similar pattern of light trading led to a
choppy day Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"Many traders seem to have quit trading for the year and others
are less active," said Peter Beutel, president of the energy risk
management firm Cameron Hanover, in a research note.
</P>
<P>
Crude futures have since retreated as OPEC boosted supplies and
several forecasters cut demand predictions. But in recent weeks,
prices have held generally to a range between $88 and $92,
leading some analysts to conclude investors are seeking direction
and may be poised to make another push for $100 a barrel in the
new year.
</P>
<P>
"The markets are looking for something that will provide that
sense of trend that is currently missing," Beutel said.
</P>
<P>
Because of the holidays, it may be a while before a trend
emerges, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
"We most likely will have to wait until mid-January for volume to
pick up in most complexes, as (investors) decide which of the
countervailing factors at work are likely to dominate the early
innings of the New Year," said Edward Meir, an analyst at MF
Global UK Ltd., in a research note.
</P>
<P>
Other energy futures were mixed Friday. January heating oil
futures gained 0.71 cent to $2.5966 a gallon on the Nymex, while
January gasoline futures added 2.63 cents to $2.3539 a gallon.
January natural gas futures dropped 2.9 cents to $7.108 per 1,000
cubic feet on the Nymex.
</P>
<P>
In London, Brent crude rose 58 cents to $91.46 a barrel on the
ICE Futures exchange.
