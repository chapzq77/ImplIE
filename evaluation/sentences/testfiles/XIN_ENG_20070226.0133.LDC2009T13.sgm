1st LD Writethru: Hamas political leader arrives in Moscow for
talks

MOSCOW, Feb. 26 (Xinhua)
</P>
<P>
Hamas political leader Khaled Meshaal arrived in Moscow on Monday
for talks aimed at starting cooperation between the international
community and the new Palestinian government.
</P>
<P>
"We value Russia's position and we want to discuss the results of
the agreement, recently reached in Mecca, with the Russian
leadership," Meshaal was quoted by the Interfax news agency as
saying upon arrival.
</P>
<P>
"We lay weight on Russia's position regarding the lifting of the
economic blockade on Palestine," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Our goal is to launch interaction between the international
community and the new Palestinian government. The agreement
reached in Mecca underscores certain progress and makes our
program public," he said.
</P>
<P>
The rival Palestinian movements Fatah and Hamas agreed in the
Saudi holy city of Mecca earlier this month to form a national
unity government to replace the Hamas-led government in a bid to
lift the siege on the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Meshaal said Israel was "not making concessions" in negotiations
and appealed to the Quartet and Israel to respect the Mecca deal.
</P>
<P>
"The Quartet of international mediators should discuss with
Israel the issue of respect for the agreement reached in Mecca,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Russia is a member of the Quartet of international mediators for
peace in the Middle East. The other members are the United
States, the United Nations and the European Union.
</P>
<P>
After a meeting last week in Berlin, the Quartet reiterated it
would only "support a Palestinian government committed to
nonviolence, recognition of Israel and acceptance of previous
agreements and obligations, including the Roadmap." Hamas has so
far refused to meet these demands.
</P>
<P>
It was unclear who in the Russian leadership would meet Meshaal
during his stay in Moscow, which is believed to last two days.
</P>
<P>
The Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement on Thursday
that, during Meshaal's visit, "Russia plans to continue its
efforts to help restore stability on the Palestinian territories
and resolve disputes within the Palestinian Authority following
the Mecca agreement between Fatah and Hamas."
</P>
<P>
It is Meshaal's second trip to Russia. He led a Hamas delegation
to Moscow for meetings with Russian officials in March 2006.
