A man allegedly shot his unconscious wife to death in her
hospital bed because he didn't want to see her suffer any more,
police and doctors said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Joseph Polimeni and police officers at Prato hospital said in
Italian TV interviews that the 78-year-old man had been told
earlier on Saturday that his 82-year-old wife was in the final
stages of Alzheimer's disease, which severely impairs memory and
thought and affects personality.

The man, a former traffic policeman, apparently went home and
returned Saturday afternoon with a pistol, officials said. He
covered his wife's forehead and chest with towels and then shot
her three times, hospital and police officials said in Prato, a
Tuscan town 300 kilometers (185 miles) north of Rome.

He then sat calmly on a chair near the bed until police arrived,
they said. The officials quoted the husband as saying he didn't
want his wife to suffer any more.

The husband was questioned and jailed, the Italian news agency
ANSA reported. It said he told police that he had cared single-
handedly for his wife since she developed Alzheimer's in 1999.
