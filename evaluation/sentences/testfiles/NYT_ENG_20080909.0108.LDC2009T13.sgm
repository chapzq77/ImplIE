MCCAIN FOCUSES ON BONUS PAY AND TUTORS
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In comparison with Sen. Barack Obama's education plan, Sen. John
McCain's is terse.
</P>
<P>
Among his short list of initiatives, McCain, the Republican
presidential nominee, includes bonus pay for teachers who raise
student achievement or who take jobs in hard-to-staff schools, an
expansion of after-school tutoring, and new federal support for
online schools and for the voucher program in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
The brevity of McCain's plan reflects his view that the federal
government should play a limited role in public education, and
his commitment to holding the line on education spending, said
Lisa Graham Keegan, a McCain adviser and former Arizona education
commissioner.
</P>
<P>
"Education is obviously not the issue Sen. McCain spends the most
time on," Keegan said, adding that his plan's limited scope
should not be interpreted as a lack of commitment to education
and school reform. "He's been a quiet and consistent supporter of
parents and educators who he thinks are making a difference."
</P>
<P>
McCain would make it easier for students in failing schools to
get taxpayer-financed after-school tutoring by private companies.
Under President Bush's No Child Left Behind law, students at
schools that have repeatedly missed testing goals are eligible,
but few parents nationwide have taken advantage of those
services. That is because, in McCain's view, local school
districts often set up a cumbersome process for certifying the
tutors and do a poor job of getting the word out to parents.
</P>
<P>
Under McCain's plan, the federal government would certify
tutoring companies, letting them market directly to parents.
</P>
<P>
Both the McCain and Obama plans acknowledge that the No Child
Left Behind law has helped the nation focus on closing the
achievement gap between minorities and whites, but they also
promise changes to the law without offering many specifics. And
both are silent on the law's deadline requiring that all students
be proficient in reading and math by 2014.
</P>
<P>
Both plans also propose performance pay initiatives. McCain would
reallocate 60 percent of the $3 billion in current federal
spending on teacher quality programs to finance direct payments
to "high-performing teachers" who take jobs in high-needs schools
and to those who improve achievement.
</P>
<P>
Obama's plan would offer federal financing to districts that
negotiate performance pay programs with teachers unions. It would
allow bonuses for veteran teachers who help novice colleagues as
well as those who teach in hard-to-staff schools or demonstrate
high levels of performance.
</P>
<P>
Both national teachers' unions have endorsed Obama.
