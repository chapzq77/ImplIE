McCain ' s national finance co-chair Loeffler resigns because of
lobbyist ties

WASHINGTON 2008-05-18 21:28:30 UTC
</P>
<P>
John McCain's national finance co-chairman has stepped down, the
latest casualty of a presidential campaign eager to cauterize
damage caused by its ties to lobbyists.
</P>
<P>
Former Texas Rep. Thomas G. Loeffler, one of McCain's key
fundraisers, resigned in the wake of a new McCain policy on
conflicts of interest that required campaign volunteers to
disclose their lobbying connections.
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Loeffler has resigned from his position with the campaign,"
McCain spokesman Tucker Bounds said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Loeffler, who runs the lobbying shop The Loeffler Group, is the
highest profile departure from McCain's inner circle since a
summer 2007 shake-up cost McCain his campaign manager and chief
strategist.
</P>
<P>
Among Loeffler's clients is the European Aeronautic Defence and
Space Co., the parent company of plane manufacturer Airbus.
Northrop Grumman Corp. and EADS won a lucrative contract to
provide air refueling tankers for the Air Force. McCain helped
scuttle an earlier contract in 2004 that would have gone to a
competitor, Boeing Co.
</P>
<P>
Loeffler's firm also has lobbied for other foreign interests and
foreign governments. Newsweek reported over the weekend that
Loeffler's firm was paid $15 (euro9.68) million by Saudi Arabia.
The news magazine also said Loeffler listed meeting McCain along
with the Saudi ambassador to "discuss US-Kingdom of Saudi Arabia
relations," even though Loeffler told a reporter last month that
he had not discussed his clients with McCain.
</P>
<P>
McCain's new policy prohibits any staffer on the campaign from
being a registered lobbyist or foreign agent. Part-time
volunteers for the campaigns, such as Loeffler, have to disclose
whether they are registered lobbyists or lobbying on behalf of
foreign entities.
</P>
<P>
Under the policy, dated May 15, such volunteer advisers cannot
lobby McCain or his legislative staffs during the period they
serve on the campaign.
</P>
<P>
The work of lobbyists close to McCain had become fodder for
critics, undermining McCain's image as a reformer who has tried
to restrict the influence special interests in government.
</P>
<P>
McCain advisers Doug Goodyear, who was to run the Republican
convention in St. Paul, Minnesota, and Doug Davenport, a regional
campaign director for the Mid-Atlantic states, also resigned this
month. Both worked for DCI Group, a consulting firm hired to
improve the image of Myanmar's military junta.
</P>
<P>
When the policy was announced last week, McCain fired energy
policy adviser Eric Burgeson, who represents energy companies as
a lobbyist.
</P>
<P>
The campaign also asked Craig Shirley to resign from McCain's
Virginia leadership team because he was behind an independent
group that has been criticizing Democrats Hillary Rodham Clinton
and Barack Obama on the Internet. McCain's new policy also states
that no one with a campaign title or position may participate in
so-called 527 groups, which can raise unlimited amounts of money
for television ads not controlled by campaigns.
</P>
<P>
But the policy also underscored the fine line McCain has drawn.
Several top strategists working on his campaign are lobbyists who
have taken leaves of absence from their jobs to work for McCain.
Among them are campaign manager Rick Davis, whose past clients
have included a Russian industrialist, and Charlie Black, a high
profile Washington lobbyist with domestic and foreign clients
</P>
<P>
In adopting the policy and making it public, the McCain campaign
sought to stabilize the bad press he was getting and turn the
tables on his most likely Democratic opponent.
</P>
<P>
"Sen. McCain has put forward the most strident policy to date,"
said McCain spokeswoman Jill Hazelbaker. "It now falls on Barack
Obama to meet this level of transparency and disclose which
lobbyists are serving as advisers to his campaign."
</P>
<P>
Obama has been a vocal critic of Washington lobbyists and, unlike
McCain, has refused to accept contributions from federal
lobbyists and from political action committees. However, he has
accepted money from the corporate executives who retain lobbyists
and who have special causes before Congress. He also has had
unpaid advisers with federal lobbying clients. Some campaign
officials previously had lobbying jobs.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, Obama deputy campaign manager Steve Hildebrand
told The Associated Press the campaign has no problem with
lobbyists volunteering to work, but no federal lobbyists are on
the campaign's payroll and they cannot donate money or collect it
from others. "We're not going to prevent people from being
volunteers on this campaign," he said.
</P>
<P>
Hildebrand said he gave up federal lobbying work for an
environmental group, as a condition of taking his paid staff
position. According to lobbying records, Hildebrand was lobbying
on behalf of climate change legislation written by McCain and
Sen. Joseph Lieberman, from Connecticut.
