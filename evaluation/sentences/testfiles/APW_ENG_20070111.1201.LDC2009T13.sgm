<P>
A judge demanded life imprisonment on Thursday for six Lebanese
suspects accused of being involved in a failed train bombing
attempt in Germany, court officials said.
</P>
<P>
In his formal charge sheet, investigating Judge Abdul Rahim
Hammoud accused the six suspects of trying to kill a large number
of people in the attempted attacks, said the officials, speaking
on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to
speak to the media.
</P>
<P>
Last year, a Lebanese prosecutor referred the suspects to a
magistrate for further questioning on charges of attempting to
commit "mass killings and starting fires with flammable materials
in German passenger trains" in July.
</P>
<P>
Five of the six suspects are in Lebanese custody and have been
referred to a criminal court for trial. No date for the trial has
been set, and information about their attorneys was not
available.
</P>
<P>
They were arrested in August and September in Lebanon, and
Lebanese authorities have insisted on questioning and prosecuting
the suspects.
</P>
<P>
The sixth, Youssef Mohammed el-Hajdib, 21, is in German custody
after he was arrested Aug. 19 in the German city of Kiel.
Lebanese authorites plan to try him in absentia.
</P>
<P>
The two main suspects -- el-Hajdib and Jihad Hamad -- are accused
of planting bombs on July 31 in two trains at a railway station
in the German city of Cologne, where they were seen in grainy
surveillance camera footage pulling wheeled suitcases.
</P>
<P>
The bombs were found later in the day on regional trains, and
German authorities said that the detonators went off but failed
to ignite the devices.
</P>
<P>
Another suspect held in Germany is Fadi al-Saleh, a 23-year-old
Syrian who was arrested with a computer carrying plans for bombs
downloaded from the Internet, German authorities said.
</P>
<P>
The head of Germany's Federal Crime Office said last year that
the suspects were partially motivated by anger over the September
2005 publication by a Danish magazine of cartoons of the Prophet
Muhammad that caused widespread outrage in the Muslim world.
