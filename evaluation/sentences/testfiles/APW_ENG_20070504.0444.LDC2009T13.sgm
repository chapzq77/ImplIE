German industrial union, employers hold wage talks over night
without breakthrough

<P>
Germany's powerful IG Metall union and industrial employers
struggled to find common ground early Friday, as make-or-break
wage talks entered their second day.
</P>
<P>
Leaders from IG Metall, which represents more than 3 million auto
workers, steel makers and other engineering professions, began
meeting Thursday afternoon to try to agree on how much to raise
workers' wages.
</P>
<P>
The union has threatened to call a full-blown strike if it can
not secure a significant wage increase for its members. IG Metall
has been pushing for a 6.5 percent raise. It rejected an offer
employers made last month of a 3 percent increase -- made up of a
formal salary rise of 2.5 percent and a half-percent "economy
bonus."
</P>
<P>
After a 2 1/2-hour break early Friday, a union leader said
employers had made a better offer, but declined to provide any
numbers.
</P>
<P>
More than 300,000 workers walked off their jobs briefly in a rash
of warning strikes organized by IG Metall ahead of the talks, in
an effort to keep the pressure on employers for what they say is
their share of Germany's recent economic upswing.
</P>
<P>
"The cupboard is full and we finally want our slice of the ham,"
said Uwe Hueck, a union representative for Porsche.
</P>
<P>
Unemployment in Germany is below 10 percent for the first time
since 2002, production is on the rise and optimism among both
businesses and consumers is reaching new highs. The government
has also raised its forecast for 2007 economic growth for the
second time this year, predicting that gross domestic product
would increase by 2.3 percent.
