Army, Iraqi Government Disagree on Sunni Guards

TAJI, Iraq
</P>
<P>
When U.S. soldiers moved into an abandoned wool factory near here
two months ago, they were pounded with bombs, mortar and gunfire.
</P>
<P>
``We were not really well received,'' Capt. David Fulton said
with deliberate understatement.
</P>
<P>
The fighting around this town north of Baghdad went on for a
month, until local Sunni Muslim tribesmen decided they had had
enough of the insurgents in their midst and started working with
the Americans. About 220 of those tribesmen now staff checkpoints
and have started cooperating with Shiite counterparts who once
were their enemies, said Fulton, a U.S. Army company commander.
</P>
<P>
Experiences like these have persuaded the U.S. military command
to step up efforts to recruit armed residents as local protection
forces, authorizing its officers to use emergency cash and other
funds at their disposal to strike contracts with tribal leaders.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, the top U.S. commander in Iraq, Gen. David H.
Petraeus, credited the strategy with beginning to turn around an
insurgent haven as he toured the region of dusty villages, citrus
plantations, fish farms and palm groves near Taji, about 12 miles
north of the capital.
</P>
<P>
But the Shiite-led government, which has been under intense U.S.
pressure to dismantle Shiite militias, complains that the policy
legitimizes what they regard as the Sunni equivalent.
</P>
<P>
``They solve one problem by creating another,'' said Sami al-
Askari, an aide to Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki and member of
his Islamic Dawa Party. ``This is a seed for civil war.''
</P>
<P>
Al-Maliki wants to screen the volunteers before they are allowed
to carry weapons, and he wants them incorporated into security
forces under the government's control, al-Askari said.
</P>
<P>
The strategy has been the subject of heated discussion between
al-Maliki and Petraeus and U.S. Ambassador Ryan Crocker, both
sides acknowledged Saturday. But Petraeus dismissed as
``ludicrous'' a report that al-Maliki felt he could no longer
work with the general.
</P>
<P>
``This is really, really hard stuff, and occasionally people
agree to disagree,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
With the country's largest Sunni bloc suspending participation in
his Cabinet, al-Maliki needs the support of Shiite conservatives
in his governing coalition, who are angry about U.S. raids
targeting Shiite militants in areas such as Baghdad's Sadr City
and the southern city of Karbala.
</P>
<P>
``Petraeus is not answerable before the Iraqi people. Maliki
is,'' said Haider Abadi, another one of the prime minister's
aides. ``There is mounting pressure on Maliki because of these
casualties.''
</P>
<P>
Petraeus acknowledged the government's concerns about working
with Sunni tribes.
</P>
<P>
``Obviously there is a concern, particularly in the areas where
al-Qaida had sanctuaries, that some of them may have had ties
with them before,'' he said. ``But at the end of the day,
situations like this historically have been resolved by the local
citizens helping with local security.''
</P>
<P>
In the long term, he said, the goal is to find jobs for the
tribal volunteers in the Iraqi security forces. But it can take
months to get them screened and trained.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, ``we applaud when they turn their guns against
al-Qaida,'' Petraeus said.
</P>
<P>
U.S. commanders are not allowed to put the fighters on salaries.
But they can dip into their discretionary funds to offer rewards
or pay for short-term, renewable contracts to protect what the
military regards as ``critical infrastructure.'' Around Taji,
local tribesmen run checkpoints; guard schools and water
treatment plants; and even rebuilt a blown-up bridge in 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
Compensation typically runs from $100 to $300 per person per
month, said Col. Mike Meese, a member of Petraeus' staff. The
deals are signed by sheiks, who must vouch for their men. U.S.
soldiers also collect each person's name, address, fingerprints,
retinal scan and other information, Meese said.
</P>
<P>
Petraeus said the U.S. military is authorized to provide weapons
only to the official security forces, but his commanders do help
the volunteers with food, fuel and, occasionally, ammunition.
</P>
<P>
U.S. commanders report a significant drop in attacks in the areas
where they are working with the tribesmen. They say insurgents
are offering between $300 and $30,000 to plant a single bomb in
areas under the control of tribal volunteers, a sign of how much
more difficult it has become to do the job.
</P>
<P>
Petraeus arrived at a strip of stores southwest of Taji in a
snaking convoy of armored Humvees that kicked up a huge cloud of
dust. Helicopters circled overhead as the general bounded from
his vehicle and strode down the street, accompanied by the head
of the local volunteers, an Iraqi army colonel and the police
chief. He stopped to buy sodas from a tiny grocery store, and
chatted with a man who was building several more shops in a
market that was all but deserted in January.
</P>
<P>
Petraeus said the cooperation between the Iraqi security forces
and local tribesmen was bringing security and commerce back,
saying their combined efforts had al-Qaida in Iraq ``knocked off
balance.'' He cited the capture of a local al-Qaida in Iraq
leader.
</P>
<P>
``Yes, he was my friend,'' commented Abu Azam, a tribal chief in
a beige dishdasha with a pistol hanging from a holster.
</P>
<P>
``Please, please,'' Petraeus said, as he jokingly covered his
ears.
</P>
<P>
``That was before he sided with al-Qaida,'' Abu Azam hastily
added.
</P>
<P>
In violence Saturday, four Iraqi special forces commandos were
killed and four injured when a bomb targeted their patrol in
Samarra, police said. The patrol opened fire after the attack,
injuring five civilians, according to police and hospital
officials.
</P>
<P>
Also Saturday, police in Baghdad recovered the bodies of 20 men
shot execution-style, some of them with signs of torture. And a
car bomb exploded in the central Karada neighborhood of the
capital, killing at least four people and injuring 10 others,
police said.
</P>
<P>
Gunmen targeted the home of a Turkmen political leader in the
disputed northern city of Kirkuk, killing six people and injuring
six others, police said. An Iraqi soldier was killed and two
other injured in a roadside bombing in the city.
</P>
<P>
The chairman of the lawyers union in the southern city of Basra
was assassinated by unknown gunmen Friday night on his way home.
</P>
<P>
Times staff writers Said Rifai and Raheem Salman in Baghdad and
correspondents in Baghdad, Basra and Hillah contributed to this
report.
