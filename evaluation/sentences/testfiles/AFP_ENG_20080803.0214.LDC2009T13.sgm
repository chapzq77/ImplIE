Olympics: Torch relay journeys through quake-devastated Sichuan
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The Olympic torch relay made its way through southwest Sichuan
province on Sunday, three months after the area was devastated by
a huge earthquake, state media said.
</P>
<P>
The torch passed through the village of Guang'an, the home of
former Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping, who instigated many of the
economic reforms that sparked the country's economic boom, the
Xinhua news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The 90-minute leg of the relay started after a minute's silence
in memory of the victims of the 8.0-magnitude quake, which left
close to 90,000 people dead or missing.
</P>
<P>
The leg was started by female policewoman Jiang Min, who took
part in the rescue effort after the May 12 quake and who lost 10
relatives in the disaster, Xinhua said.
</P>
<P>
Originally the torch was scheduled to pass through Sichuan
between 15-18 June, but the quake forced a change of plan. The
torch will stay in the province until Tuesday, when it heads to
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
During its Sichuan leg it will pass through Mianyang, one of the
towns worst hit by the quake.
