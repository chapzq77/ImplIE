Sri Lankan president leaves for India
</P>
<P>
COLOMBO, Nov. 10 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan President Mahinda
Rajapakse departed here Monday heading for the Indian capital of
New Delhi via the Maldives to meet Indian leaders, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
Rajapakse departed Monday afternoon on a special flight for New
Delhi to attend the BIMSTEC (Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-
Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation) summit to be held in
the Indian capital.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh, India, Myanmar, Sri Lanka and Thailand are members of
the economic co-operation summit meeting, officials said.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said Rajapakse
will stop over in the Maldives to attend the oath-taking ceremony
of the Maldives' fourth President Mohamed Nasheed scheduled to be
held on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In New Delhi, Rajapakse is to meet Indian Prime Minister Manmohan
Singh on the sidelines of the BIMSTEC summit.
</P>
<P>
His visit came after his brother and special advisor Basil
Rajapakse's meeting with senior Indian officials late last month
on issues of the military action in northern Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
The Sri Lankan president is expected to apprise Indian leaders on
his government's political package to be offered to the Tamil
minority after the conclusion of military action.
</P>
<P>
The Sri Lankan government maintains that the military action is a
pure humanitarian operation to free the civilians from the
control of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) rebels.
</P>
<P>
Claiming discrimination at the hands of the Sinhalese-dominated
governments, the LTTE has been fighting since the mid-1980s to
set up  a separate homeland for the Tamils in the north and east,
resulting in the killing of more than 70,000 people.
