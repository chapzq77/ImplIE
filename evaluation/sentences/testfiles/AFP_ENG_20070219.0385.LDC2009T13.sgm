Govt launches bus scheme to ease jams in Nigeria's economic
capital
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Authorities in Lagos, Nigeria's sprawling economic capital, on
Monday launched a new bus scheme aimed at easing the traffic jams
for which the city is notorious, officials said.
</P>
<P>
Two hundred and eighty luxury red-painted buses were on Monday
deployed to some selected major Lagos routes under the Bus Rapid
Transit (BRT) system.
</P>
<P>
Special lanes are set aside for the government-owned red-painted
BRT buses and trespassers on them are liable to a fine of 50,000
naira (385 dollars / 308 euros), a senior official of the Lagos
transport ministry, Rotimi Oyekan, said.
</P>
<P>
Lagos has no urban railway, tube or tram service. Commuters
travel by private car, privately owned lorry-buses, minibuses or
motorbike taxis.
</P>
<P>
The result is the "go-slows" for which the city is notorious and
which are often exacerbated by fuel shortages and huge queues in
front of filling stations.
</P>
<P>
Commuters regularly complain of taking three hours to cover 40
kilometres (25 miles) in the city.
</P>
<P>
Oyekan said that the efficient operation of BRT buses would
decongest the roads as many workers and traders would leave their
cars and patronise the red buses because of their safety, low
tariff and ability to get to destinations fast.
</P>
<P>
The BRT bus drivers have been specially trained to maintain a
special speed limit, to be courteous to commuters while the
vehicles are fitted with communications gadgets, he said in a
radio interview.
</P>
<P>
A further 300 buses are expected to be added to the fleet before
the end of March, officials said.
</P>
<P>
Observers said that with the introduction of BRT buses,
government's intention was to gradually phase out "molue", the
ill-maintained privately- owned yellow lorry buses, often prone
to accidents.
</P>
<P>
More than half of all vehicles in Nigeria are found in Lagos,
where officials say illiteracy, selfishness and road indiscipline
are responsible for gargantuan traffic jams and frequent crashes.
</P>
<P>
The city's population is just over nine million according to
federal government figures, but local state government estimates
put it at closer to 17 million, a figure more in line with UN
estimates.
