Is Belgium ' s end ear?

<P>
In a hoax that sent panic through the nation, a Belgian TV
station reported last year that the Dutch-speaking half of the
country had declared independence and the king and queen had
fled.
</P>
<P>
Now, a notion that was once a fantasy of fringe politicians is
suddenly on everybody's lips: Is Belgium about to come an end?
</P>
<P>
Almost three months after elections, Belgium has no government,
efforts to form one are on hold, and unity appeals by King Albert
II have been ignored -- eroding the prestige of a monarchy often
hailed as the glue holding this bilingual nation of 10.5 million
together.
</P>
<P>
Such is the deadlock between Dutch and French-speaking parties
over how to form the next government that mainstream politicians
and media are now openly airing the view that Belgium's
linguistic camps may be better off divorcing.
</P>
<P>
"I don't want the end of Belgium, but I fear it will happen,"
says Gerard Deprez, a former Christian Democratic leader from
French-speaking Wallonia.
</P>
<P>
Elio di Rupo, the Francophone Socialist leader, says the danger
of Belgium's disintegration "is greater now than it was on June
10" -- when elections triggered the protracted haggling over
forming the government.
</P>
<P>
In the June 10 ballot, Christian Democrats and Liberals won 81 of
the 150 parliamentary seats and agreed to form a coalition. But
the composition of the government has been stalled due to
bickering over Flemish demands for more autonomy and the
redrawing a bilingual Brussels-area voting district.
</P>
<P>
Belgium's 6.5 million Dutch-speakers and 4 million Francophones
south have enjoyed broad self-rule since the 1980s; only Brussels
is officially a bilingual region.
</P>
<P>
Many Flemish grouse their wealthier, service-based economy
subsidizes Wallonia. Dutch-speakers view the Francophones'
dilapidated cities and 14 percent unemployment -- double their
rate -- as the legacy of hardline Socialist rule
</P>
<P>
Dutch-speakers are demanding autonomy in health care, justice and
transport -- some of the last bastions of central control from
Brussels. Many feel the next logical step would be full
independence.
</P>
<P>
"Living together in one country is impossible if year after year
the minority prevents the majority to realize its most important
desires," Het Laatste Nieuws, Belgium's largest daily, argued
recently.
</P>
<P>
Seeing politicians "at each other's throats" in linguistic spats
makes Belgians believe divorce is possible, says Jos Geysels, a
commentator said in the daily De Morgen.
</P>
<P>
Chris Peeters, an Antwerp resident, sees widespread support for
Flemish independence "because all the difficulties we have had
over the last 10 years in Belgium ... are coming from the French
part. So it would be a solution for Belgium to split apart."
</P>
<P>
A recent VTM television network poll found 46 percent of Flemings
favoring independence -- the highest level in years due to the
linguistic political sniping.
</P>
<P>
Among parties, independence is an official goal only of the far-
right Flemish Interest party but its growing popularity -- it won
17 seats in the June voting -- has radicalized even mainstream
Flemish parties. There is no comparable Francophone movement.
</P>
<P>
The daily De Standaard recently devoted several pages to the
practical details of shutting down Belgium. Given its healthy
economy, it said, Flanders could easily join the EU but divvying
up national icons such as the Royal Library or the city of
Brussels would be difficult.
</P>
<P>
The demise of Belgium would bring this country full circle.
</P>
<P>
In 1912, Jules Destree, a Francophone Socialist, wrote King
Albert I a letter saying his nation -- made independent by the
Netherlands in 1830 -- was an artificial nation with no regard
for reality on the ground.
</P>
<P>
Flemings and Walloons are complete opposites, Destree argued.
</P>
<P>
"What excites one, leaves the other stone-cold ... The Walloon
belongs to the Latin civilization, the Fleming to the Germanic
culture. We have in Belgium Walloons and Flemings. There are no
Belgians, sire."
