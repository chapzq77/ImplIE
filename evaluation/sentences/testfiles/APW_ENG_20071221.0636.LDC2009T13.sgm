German restaurateurs '  group files court challenge to smoking
curbs

<P>
A group representing German restaurant and bar owners said Friday
it has filed a challenge to the country's supreme court against
new laws that restrict smoking.
</P>
<P>
Several German states recently have introduced, or plan to
introduce, partial bans on smoking in restaurants and bars,
although the restrictions generally have fallen short of near-
total bans on smoking in enclosed spaces elsewhere in Europe.
</P>
<P>
The industry group, DEHOGA, said it joined in a suit filed to the
Federal Constitutional Court by an inn owner in the southwestern
state of Baden-Wuerttemberg, which on Aug. 1 became one of the
first to introduce curbs on smoking.
</P>
<P>
The state's ban, like most others in Germany, allowed for special
rooms to be set aside for smokers, but DEHOGA argued that that
puts owners of one-room bars, such as the plaintiff, at a
disadvantage.
</P>
<P>
It said the man, whose customers were 70 percent smokers, had
seen his turnover decline by more than 30 percent in the August-
November period from a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
"In most hotels and many restaurants, the implementation of the
smoking ban has gone without problems so far," DEHOGA head Ingrid
Hartges said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
However, "there are significant problems in one-room operations
... in which the majority of regular customers often are
smokers," she added. "Many of these caterers are angry ... and
fear for their existence."
</P>
<P>
It was not immediately clear when the court might consider the
complaint.
