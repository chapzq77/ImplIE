Iraqi Agencies Said to Engage in Spy Vs. Spy
</HEADLINE>

BAGHDAD, Iraq
</P>
<P>
Suspicious of Iraq's CIA-funded national intelligence agency,
members of the Iraqi government have erected a ``shadow'' secret
service that critics say is driven by a Shiite agenda and has
left the country with dueling spy agencies.
</P>
<P>
The minister of state for national security, a Shiite named
Sherwan Waeli, has built a spy service boasting an estimated
1,200 intelligence agents out of a second-tier ministry with a
minimal staff and meager budget, Western officials say.
</P>
<P>
``He has representatives in every province,'' a Western diplomat
said, speaking on condition of anonymity. ``At the moment, it's a
slightly shady parallel organization.''
</P>
<P>
Shiite officials say the minister is providing information on al-
Qaida and Saddam Hussein's Baath party that isn't being supplied
by the Iraqi National Intelligence Service, or INIS, the
institution meant to be Iraq's primary spy service.
</P>
<P>
The INIS was established in the spring of 2004 by the U.S.
occupation authority and since then has been under the command of
Gen. Mohammed Abdullah Shahwani, a Sunni involved in a CIA-backed
coup plot against Saddam a decade ago. Over the last three years,
Shahwani's agency has been funded by the CIA, according to the
U.S. military and Iraqi officials.
</P>
<P>
The service reports directly to Shiite Prime Minister Nouri al-
Maliki, but Shiite members of his government distrust the agency,
which contains intelligence agents from the Saddam era. For most
of 2005 and the first part of 2006, Shahwani was banned from
attending Cabinet meetings.
</P>
<P>
``The general feeling is that the intelligence service is not
functioning or conducting its work in the proper way,'' said
Deputy Parliament Speaker Sheik Khalid Attiyah, a Shiite.
</P>
<P>
The two spy agencies risk becoming open partisans in Iraq's civil
war if vying political parties do not strike a real agreement on
how to rule the country, one analyst warned.
</P>
<P>
``If no critical compromise is reached, the security services are
going to fall apart on ethnic, sectarian and party lines,'' said
Joost Hiltermann, Middle East director of the International
Crisis Group. ``It will be a failed state situation like
Somalia.''

<P>
Shahwani's agency has antagonized Iraq's new Shiite elite since
its conception. In September 2004, his men arrested at least 50
members of a southern Shiite party called Hezbollah and detained
them for several months. That autumn, Shahwani accused one of the
country's main Shiite political parties, the Supreme Council for
the Islamic Revolution in Iraq, of being on Iran's payroll and
blamed its militia for the deaths of 10 of his agents.
</P>
<P>
The Shiite drive to strengthen the parallel secret service can be
traced to the spring of 2005, when Washington, D.C., mindful of
Shiite politicians' close ties to Iran, rebuffed then-Prime
Minister Ibrahim al-Jaafari's effort to take charge of the INIS.
</P>
<P>
The Americans had invested heavily in creating a strong spy
service and had appointed Shahwani to head the organization.
Shahwani, who owns a home in the United States, has been a
crucial asset to the Americans since the fall of Saddam's regime,
providing them access to old army officers, and forming an Iraqi
special forces unit, called the ``Shahwanis,'' that fought in the
November 2004 battle to retake Fallujah from Sunni insurgents.
</P>

</P>
<P>
Shahwani's service ``is funded completely by the U.S. Central
Intelligence Agency, not by the Iraqi government. U.S. funding
for the INIS amounts to $3 billion over a three-year period that
started in 2004,'' a U.S. military official said on condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the funding, CIA spokesman Paul Gimigliano said,
``The CIA does not as a rule discuss publicly the details of its
relationships with the intelligence services of other
countries.''
</P>
<P>
After failing to remove Shahwani in 2005, Shiite officials sought
to fill the gap. The minister of state for national security at
the time, Abdel Kareem Anizi, lobbied al-Jaafari to turn his post
into a fully funded ministry charged with security affairs.
</P>
<P>
``He pushed to provide a service. He was very proactive. He
exerted a lot of pressure and requested to make his post a full
ministry, but the proposal didn't move an inch,'' a former
government official said on condition of anonymity. ``He started
to recruit informers and sympathizers. He couldn't give them full
salaries, but he could give them government privileges and built
up a network of informers.''
</P>
<P>
When Anizi stepped down, he was replaced government by Waeli. The
service has expanded dramatically in the last nine months, Waeli
said, getting around its limited state budget by hiring agents on
contracts.
</P>
<P>
The agency provides a hard-line Shiite view in national security
meetings, observers say.
</P>
<P>
``It's more Shia, it's slightly reactionary in a Shiite sense,''
the Western diplomat said. ``If you talk about (Sunni Muslim)
Anbar province, you know he is going to take view largely
uncharitable toward the Anbar tribes.''
</P>
<P>
A U.S. official suggested that certain sectarian groups are
frustrated with their inability to control the INIS and use it to
advance sectarian agendas, and that is fueling the drive for the
parallel service. The official also charged that Iran has sought
to undermine the INIS, in part because of its close ties to the
United States and the CIA.
</P>
<P>
``There might be some friction caused by the way this service
operates -- it doesn't operate on a sectarian basis,'' the U.S.
official said on condition of anonymity. ``There appear to be
people in Iraq, and perhaps in one of its neighboring countries,
who do not like that fact.''
</P>
<P>
A Shiite official who deals with insurgency issues said that
Waeli was trying to steer the service away from a sectarian bias,
but the problem was with those surrounding him.
</P>
<P>
``He is trying very hard to move away from sectarianism and say
this is a government to protect the people, but some of his
officers have sectarian views.''
</P>
<P>
Waeli said his main goals were to crack down on al-Qaida,
Baathists, militias and criminals. But his service has no legal
charter to be engaged in domestic spying or arresting people and
is lobbying to pass a law through Parliament that would formalize
its surveillance activities, make it a full ministry and put it
in charge of the CIA-funded INIS.
</P>
<P>
That legislation would cap the agency's transformation from a
minor state ministry into a pillar of Iraq's security apparatus.
But the Shiite coalition itself has not made its mind up about
whether to formalize Waeli's powers.
</P>
<P>
Sunnis speak with severe distrust of Waeli's ministry, describing
it as sectarian in nature.
</P>
<P>
``I think non-Shiites would find it difficult to be accepted in
this ministry. It is a nonprofessional organization,'' said
independent Sunni lawmaker Mithal Alussi, who serves as an
informal consultant to al-Maliki.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
Alussi said Waeli's men have been arresting people on raids.
</P>
<P>
In their most controversial operation, Waeli's agents have spied
on at least one Sunni Parliament member for alleged terrorist
activities. The agents submitted evidence this past winter to the
Iraqi judiciary in a campaign to strip Sunni lawmaker Abdul Naser
Janabi of his parliamentary immunity.
</P>
<P>
Janabi, a Sunni fundamentalist, is accused of being behind the
killings of more than 150 Shiites in the triangle of death, a
region just south of Baghdad, where Sunni extremists regularly
target Shiites.
</P>
<P>
Parliament Speaker Mahmoud Mashadani, an ally of Janabi, said the
investigation was politically motivated, and illegal.
</P>
<P>
``The information depends on an undercover officer from a
ministry that doesn't even have the (legal) right to conduct
surveillance,'' Mashadani said.
</P>
<P>
Waeli defended his actions, saying his agents are tasked to
gather evidence by the government, adding that his men can make
arrests if authorized by the prime minister. ``We are doing our
work according to the law and for the service of the people and
so far nothing negative has been said about our security
agents,'' Waeli said.
</P>
<P>
The fact remains that Waeli and the rest of Shiite-led government
have not pursued any investigations of Shiite Parliament members
suspected of involvement in sectarian killings.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Shahwani's INIS continues to run into troubles
with the Shiite elite.
</P>
<P>
Shahwani's most recent controversy involves accusations that his
men kidnapped an Iranian diplomat in February in Baghdad. Iraqi
Foreign Minister Hoshyar Zebari said four of Shahwani's agents
were involved in the kidnapping and have been arrested.
</P>
<P>
Shahwani told the Los Angeles Times that the four detained men
belonged to him, but claimed they had been in the area on another
mission at the time the Iranian diplomat went missing. Shahwani
also accused the Iranians of inventing the story of the
kidnapping so they could in fact abduct one of his spies who had
been spying on their diplomat. Adding to the confusion, the freed
Iranian diplomat has said he was abducted by an Iraqi security
force and then tortured by the CIA.
</P>

</P>
<P>
Both Shahwani and Waeli's agencies have been accused of bending
the law in a country that has a legacy of military coups,
authoritarian regimes and unaccountable security agencies.
</P>
<P>
``In Iraq, everybody spies on everybody, everybody kills
everybody,'' Parliament Speaker Mahmoud Mashadani said.
</P>
<P>
``We are still living in a Saddam culture.''
