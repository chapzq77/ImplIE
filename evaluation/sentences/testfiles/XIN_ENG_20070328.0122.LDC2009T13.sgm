HONG KONG, March 28 (Xinhua)
</P>
<P>
Canara Bank, India's largest public sector bank in terms of
aggregate business, opened its first branch in Hong Kong on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The move is an expansion for the bank which has had a presence in
Hong Kong since 1985 by way of its wholly owned subsidiary, the
deposit-taking company (DTC) Indo Hong Kong International Finance
Ltd.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the new venture in Hong Kong, Chairman and Managing
Director of Canara Bank M.B.N. Rao said the new branch allowed
the company greater freedom to explore opportunities arising from
the growing trade between India and China by way of increased
trade finance, syndicated loans and treasury operations.

<P>
As part of the bank's Greater China expansion plans, Canara Band
also has a representative office in Shanghai and is applying for
a branch license to operate more widely in the Chinese mainland.

Associate Director-General of Investment Promotion at Invest Hong
Kong Mark Michelson congratulated the Canara Bank on its
expansion plans.

"Canara bank has rightly identified the massive potential created
by the growing trade relations between India and the Greater
China region. Equally the bank understands the pivotal role Hong
Kong is playing in financing this success. Hong Kong's reputation
as a leading global financial center is now well established, and
at Invest Hong Kong, we know Canara has made a wise choice in
upgrading its services in this city," said Michelson.

Established in 1906, Canara Bank has an asset size of over 30
billion U.S. dollars and is 73.17 percent owned by the government
of India.
