Diana driver didn't seem drunk, says bodyguard
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The driver of Princess Diana's doomed car did not seem to be
drunk on the evening of her death in a Paris road tunnel, the
bodyguard who survived the fatal crash said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Trevor Rees, the sole survivor of the crash which killed the
princess, her boyfriend Dodi Fayed and driver Henri Paul, said he
would have stopped the Frenchman from getting behind the wheel if
he had thought he was drunk.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that he had no memory of the crash but also denied
being part of a plot to kill Diana.
</P>
<P>
A French police probe found that Paul had more than three times
the French legal limit of alcohol in his blood on the night of
August 31, 1997. French and British investigators have concluded
that the crash was a tragic accident.
</P>
<P>
Rees -- formerly known as Rees-Jones -- was Fayed's bodyguard and
the only person wearing a seatbelt in the car when it hit a
pillar in the Pont de l'Alma road tunnel, with Paul driving.
</P>
<P>
Cash-till receipts from the night indicate that Paul had ordered
Ricard, an aniseed-type spirit which goes cloudy when water is
added. But Rees said he did not realise the driver was drinking
alcohol.
</P>
<P>
"I didn't pay attention to what he was drinking, I didn't think
that they were alcoholic drinks at the time," he told the inquest
into Diana's death, at London's High Court.
</P>
<P>
"He was perfectly normal. I didn't sense that he was on edge, he
was just as I knew him," Rees said in a statement to police read
out at the hearing.
</P>
<P>
Rees said he did not see Paul drinking alcohol at any point
during the evening. Asked whether, if he had seen him doing so
"you would have ensured one way or another, that he wouldn't
drive the car", he replied: "That's correct."
</P>
<P>
Fayed and Paul were killed instantly in the crash, while Diana
died from internal injuries a few hours later. Rees suffered
severe facial injuries and memory loss in the crash.
</P>
<P>
Fayed's father Mohamed Al Fayed, the owner of plush London
department store Harrods, claims they were killed in a British
establishment conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
But Rees said he knew nothing of any such plot. "I am not part of
a conspiracy to suppress the truth at all," he said in a soft
voice. "All I have ever done is given the truth as I see it."
