		sentences.txt
				One sentence per line.

		solutions.txt
				One entity (i.e. solution for one sentence) per line.
				Each token is separated by a tab.
				Each line is formatted so that each class of terms is preceded
				by the class tag "CLASS:".  Each term is preceded with term tag "TERM:".
				Each set of acceptable noun phrases are preceded with the tag "NP:".
				Each noun phrase is separated by a pipe "|".  Each noun phrase and term
				is followed by a semicolon and the index in the sentence, 
				according to the Stanford parser of the last word of that term or phrase.
				Each class tag can be followed by multiple term and np tag pairs,
				but a noun phrase tag must follow a term tag.

				Example:
						CLASS:religion	TERM:christian;5	NP:minister;6|christian minister;6

    readable/
