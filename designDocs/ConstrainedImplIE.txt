Rules for correctness of the contrained ImplIE system.

nationality - Person
jobTitle - Person
city - Person, Organization
province - Person, Organization
religion - Person, Organization
school - Person, Organization

A person can be a group of people, but not an organization.  So "soldiers" can have the class
person, but "City Council" cannot have class person.  There are many example that are
ambiguous by the term alone, but depends on the context.  An example of this is team mascots.
"Washington Huskies" can in some contexts mean the football team adminstration, and in some
contexts mean a group of people that support the team.

For these to be considered correct, the entity does not necessarily need to be a Pronoun.
For example: the entity: "the man, a journalist" is still correct, since "the man" refers to a person.

An incomplete match can be correct as long as it still makes sense.
For example: in a sentence containing the phrase "Barack Obama, US President",
							the extraction "Obama, US President" is still correct, though not ideal.

Under these specifications some capitalized entities are incorrect.  An example of this is if a term that
can only be a person class is labeled as an organization name.
For example: the entity: "Chinese Defense Department" is an incorrect extraction since a Defense Department 
is an organization, but a nationality term can only have the class person.
