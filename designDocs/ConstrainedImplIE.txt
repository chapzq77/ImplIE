Rules for correctness of the contrained ImplIE system.

nationality - Person
jobTitle - Person
city - Person, Organization
province - Person, Organization
religion - Person, Organization
school - Person, Organization

For these to be considered correct, the entity does not necessarily need to be a Pronoun.
For example: the entity: "the man, a journalist" is still correct, since "the man" refers to a person.

An incomplete match can be correct as long as it still makes sense.
For example: in a sentence containing the phrase "Barack Obama, US President",
							the extraction "Obama, US President" is still correct, though not ideal.

Under these specifications some capitalized entities are incorrect, such as mascots.
For example: the entity: "Arizona Wildcats" is an incorrect extraction since Wildcats is a mascot, not a person or an organization.
