File Structure

classTermLists/
    Files that contain terms that identify with a class.
    File names are [class name].txt.
    The terms are listed in random casing, and may be pluralized (not normalized).

		runfiles/
				Files currently used for development.
				The tests files will only account for results in this folder.
				NOTE: FILES IN THIS FOLDER MAY BE DIFFERENT FROM OTHERS
							EVEN THOUGH THE FILE NAMES ARE THE SAME

devSet/
    Development set for the Implicit Relation Extractor.
	
		sentences.txt
				One sentence per line. (Don't really need to be sentences though... it just processes the line.)

		solutions.txt
				One entity (i.e. solution for one sentence) per line.
				Each token is separated by a tab.
				Each line is formatted so that each class of terms is preceded
				by the class tag "CLASS:".  Each term is preceded with term tag "TERM:".
				Each set of acceptable noun phrases are preceded with the tag "NP:".
				Each noun phrase is separated by a pipe "|".  Each noun phrase and term
				is followed by a semicolon and the index in the sentence, 
				according to the Stanford parser of the last word of that term or phrase.
				Each class tag can be followed by multiple term and np tag pairs,
				but a noun phrase tag must follow a term tag.

				Example:
						CLASS:religion	TERM:christian;5	NP:minister;6|christian minister;6

				NOTE: solutions are made depedant on the files in classTermLists/runfiles.
							There are some answers that seem to be missing because the term is not
							listed in any of the terms in runfiles.

    readable/
				NOT UP TO DATE, IGNORE THESE FILES
				Development set written in a human readable format

testSet/
		Same as devSet, but these are for testing after development to make sure it generalizes well.
