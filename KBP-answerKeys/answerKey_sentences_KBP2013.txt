On the other hand, he also did not like the idea of  technology laden  climbs and using  cross bow harpoons, for instance,  to  secure  higher altitude crossings,. He felt this was   cheating against human endeavor and skills.  He also wanted the Solukhumbu-Mount Everest area in Nepal developed according to a long term eco-tourism master plan. This is one area he has requested his son Peter to devote his entire energies along with Jamling Norgay, the son of Tenzing Norgay. Recently,  one of  his great European disciples, and a noted mountain climber  and  European Union  eco- politician in his own right,  Reinhold   Meisner from Italy  met  Nepal’s  Prime Minister  Girija Prasad Koirala  and informed him that he would be happy to fund some schools and work out  some projects in Nepal that would preserve the area around Mount Everest. Meisner is the only climber in the world who  has managed to summit  Everest and the world’s  14 tallest peaks  without supplementary oxygen. He is also acknowledged as the world’s second most famous mountain climber after Hillary.  Meisner too  disavows ‘technical’ or ‘gadgetry’ assisted climbing which  once led to a  major mountaineering disaster in the Nepal Himalayas in 1996, well  portrayed in the movie In Thin Air.  Meisner stated during his commemoration speech in Kathmandu during the 50th anniversary of  Everest  celebrations in 1993  that Everest was now in ‘chains’ and losing its power lashing out at Nepali tourism authorities that the country was an ‘exploding environmental bomb’ because it was exploiting the world's loftiest mountains with lack of foresight, which is quite true. &quot;Don't send thousands and thousands to Everest each year,&quot; Messner had pleaded, “You have put chains and ropes and leather around Everest. It is losing its power. You need to keep Everest strong.&quot;   During that occasion Nepal’s King Gyanendra, a well known conservationist himself,  had  bestowed Hillary with honorary  Nepali citizenship. He also honored  Meisner and  Junko Taibei the first woman to climb Everest and a global environmental crusader for  helping  preserve Nepal’s mountain eco-tourism. "

But an even more shocking reality: A backlog in processing rape kits—crucial evidence in arresting violent predators—is delaying and sometimes denying justice for tens of thousands of American women.This week, NOW travels to Los Angeles County to investigate why it has the country's largest known rape kit backlog. An internal audit found that more than 50 of their cases have already exceeded the 10-year statute of limitations on rape.That begins airing tonight on most PBS stations as does Washington Week , where Gwen sits around the table with Peter Baker (New York Times), Naftali Bendavid (Wall St. Journal), Jeanne Cummings (Politico) and Ceci Connolly (Washington Post). In addition, we're asked to note that tomorrow at the Washington Week website there will be a an ""Extra!"" you can stream which will be an extended version of the roundtable.If you don't know, Washington Week has been offering basically an hour's worth of programming for some time. They claim it's a web bonus for their audience but the show really wants to expand and if any PBS friend is upset with me for stating that, let me suggest you look up the ""extra"" from earlier in the year when Gwen herself spoke of that in replying to a question a viewer e-mailed. An additional thirty minutes wouldn't be a bad thing if they'd be serious. If you've ever watched the extra each week, you know that doesn't always happen. It will be posted online tomorrow. If you watch the extra each week, you most likely grab the podcast and maybe thinking, ""Huh?"" That's because you can download the podcast (with extra) shortly after the show goes off. The difference this week is that instead of waiting until Monday afternoon for the extra to go up at the website , it will be up tomorrow. (And streaming from the website is easier for some computer users than podcasting. Catching a video podcast requires certain system requirements and certain types of connections unless someone wishes to spend hours downloading.)Meanwhile Bonnie Erbe and her guests Karen Czarnecki, Cari Dominguez, Irene Natividad and Patricia Sosa the week's news on this week's edition of PBS' To The Contrary . Check local listings, on many stations, it begins airing tonight.

We all know it could've been longer. Much longer.  Think about it.  You could root for the Detroit Lions, who haven't had a franchise quarterback since Bobby Layne starred more than 50 years ago.  Or you could cheer for the Chicago Bears, who haven't had a franchise quarterback since Sid Luckman in the '40s. No, Jim McMahon, who won a Super Bowl ring, doesn't count because he started more than 10 games only twice in seven seasons with the Bears.  Or you could root for contemporary teams such as Tampa Bay, which hasn't had a franchise quarterback in its 31 seasons, or Baltimore, which hasn't had one in the 12 seasons since it fled Cleveland.

If the two countries continue to promote biofuels as announced, they are likely to replace 7.5 per cent of fuels, which will put pressure on available farmland and clean water. "
