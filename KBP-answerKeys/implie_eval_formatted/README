Answerkeys taken out of the results spreadsheets.
They have repeating values since the script removes identical entries.
Some of the scores have been modified so that the basic scoring script results in the same values as the official scoring.
Since some of the official scoring was based on ambiguity of the supporting sentence, those correct entries were just removed.
This shouldn't cause any issues since when we run on ImplIE we will need to hand score anyway because there may be
answers that were not in the official set.
