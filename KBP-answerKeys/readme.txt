These answer keys were compiled from the KBP_results_all_teams files
which give the LDC assessment of all answers by all teams.

These spreadsheets have one row for every answer that was judged to be
correct (C), inexact (X), or redundant (R).  The context was pulled from 
the source documents from offsets for the relation justification.

The text files, correct_KBP* and inexact_KBP* can be used to automatically 
score extractions, with the caveat that extractions not included in the 
official KBP results will be counted as incorrect.
