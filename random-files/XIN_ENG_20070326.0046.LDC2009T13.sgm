BEIJING, March 26 (Xinhua)
</P>
<P>
China State Councilor Hua Jianmin said on Monday that he hopes
Intel Corporation will expand even further its cooperation with
Chinese companies after the American computer chip giant
officially announced plans to build a 2.5-billion-U.S.-dollar
plant in northeast China.
</P>
<P>
Hua made the remarks at a meeting with President and Chief
Executive Officer of Intel, Paul Otellini. The two sides
exchanged views on expanding cooperation in the information
industry.
</P>
<P>
Intel announced it will build a huge new plant in Dalian, a port
city in northeast China's Liaoning Province. Intel already has
two chip plants in Shanghai Municipality and Chengdu in southwest
China's Sichuan Province.
</P>
<P>
The plant, to be located in a high-tech zone north of Dalian's
city proper, will be one of Intel's eight factories worldwide to
produce 300-millimetre integrated wafers after it becomes
operational in the first half of 2010.
</P>
<P>
Construction of the plant will start before the end of this year,
Intel said in a press release.
</P>
<P>
The new project will make Intel "one of the largest foreign
investors in China" with nearly four billion U.S. dollars of
investment, said Otellini at Monday's press conference.
</P>
<P>
Intel has invested 1.3 billion U.S. dollars over the past two
decades and China has become its second largest market.
</P>
<P>
Hua spoke highly of Intel's investment and called on it expand
cooperation with Chinese companies.
</P>
<P>
Otellini said Intel will make full use of its technological
advantages and investment to strengthen its cooperation with
China.
