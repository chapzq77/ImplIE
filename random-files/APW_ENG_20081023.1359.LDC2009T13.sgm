Scott McClellan, President George W. Bush's former press
secretary, says he is backing Barack Obama for president.
</P>
<P>
McClellan made the endorsement during a taping of Comedian D.L.
Hughley's new show that is premiering on CNN this weekend. The
former Bush administration official said he wanted to support the
candidate that has the best chance for changing the way
Washington works and getting things done.
</P>
<P>
He's the second former Bush administration figure this week to
publicly back Obama, following former Secretary of State Colin
Powell. McClellan caused bitterness among his former co-workers
with a tell-all book that criticized Bush.
