Participants will fly first-class and stay at a top-notch hotel,
said Tomoko Kamei, a spokeswoman for SBI Holdings, whose health
service subsidiary is organising the trip in partnership with top
travel agency JTB.

"The wealthy class in China is rapidly expanding as its economy
grows. We want to target them (for health services) and also hope
to enhance business ties," she said.

Three days are set aside for medical checks on the heart and
brain but the company also hopes to brief participants on its
investment services during their stay in Japan, she said.

The subsidiary, SBI Wellness Bank, plans to organise three tours
by 2009 for a total of 30 people, with the first trip set for
July. SBI also hopes to offer similar tours for Russians although
details have yet to be decided.
