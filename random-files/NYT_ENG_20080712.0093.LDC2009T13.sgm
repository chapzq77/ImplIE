A NEW FASHION CATCHES ON IN PARIS: CHEAP BICYCLE RENTALS

PARIS
</P>
<P>
They're clunky, heavy and ugly, but they have become modish --
and they are not this season's platform shoes.
</P>
<P>
A year after the introduction of the sturdy gray bicycles known
as Velib's, they are being used all over Paris. The bikes are
cheap to rent because they are subsidized by advertising, and
other major cities, including American ones, are exploring
similar projects.
</P>
<P>
About 20,600 Velib' bicycles are in service here, with more than
1,450 self-service rental stations. The stations are only some
300 yards apart, and there are four times as many as there are
subway stations, even in a city so well served by its metro
system.
</P>
<P>
In the first year, the city says, there have been 27.5 million
trips in this city of roughly 2.1 million people, many of them
for daily commutes. On average, there are 120,000 trips a day.
And on July 27, at the conclusion here of the Tour de France, 365
lucky Velib' riders will be chosen to ride along for a while and
cross the finish line.
</P>
<P>
There are a Velib' Web site, Velib' fashions and a Velib' blog
(www.blog.velib.paris.fr/blog); one recent posting discussed the
best way to ride with a skirt. A kind of Velib' behavior has
emerged, especially at the morning rush, with people swiftly
checking for bikes in the best condition: tires inflated, chains
still attached, baskets unstolen.
</P>
<P>
Natallya Ghyssaert, a 34-year-old doctor, has an annual
subscription for 29 euros (about $46), which lets her use a bike
whenever she wants for 30 minutes at a time without extra
charges. She uses a Velib' two or three times a day, saying, "I
love it; you can see Paris, you can exercise and stay out in the
light of day."
</P>
<P>
The Velib' -- a contraction of velo for bike and liberte -- can
also be rented for a day or for a week, with a 150 euro (about
$239) deposit taken from the user's credit card if the bike is
not returned. Usage fees over 30 minutes can rise steeply: Two
hours cost 7 euros (about $11). But 96 percent of all rides are
less than 30 minutes, because bikes can be returned to any
station.
</P>
<P>
No one knows quite how many trips by car or taxi are thereby
avoided, but the "eco-friendly" nature of the Velib' has been
much promoted in a country where juice companies warn of the
risks to "our fragile planet" in lavish brochures on thick paper.
