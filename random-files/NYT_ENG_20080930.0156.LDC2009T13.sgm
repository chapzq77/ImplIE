BLOOMBERG SAID TO BE READY TO SEEK THIRD TERM AS MAYOR JONATHAN

NEW YORK
</P>
<P>
In an act that promises to upend New York City's political world,
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg plans to announce on Thursday that he
will seek a third term as mayor, according to four people who
have been told of his plans.
</P>
<P>
Bloomberg, whose second term ends in 2009, is barred by law from
running for re-election. So he will propose revising the city's
15-year-old term-limits law, which restricts him and dozens of
elected leaders to two-four year terms, those people said.
</P>
<P>
In his appearance on Thursday, Bloomberg, a former Wall Street
trader and the founder of a billion-dollar financial data firm,
will argue that the worldwide financial crisis -- and its
potentially severe impact on New York City -- demands his steady
hand and business experience.
</P>
<P>
The decision to challenge the term-limits law, which was twice
approved by New York voters, represents a remarkable about-face
for Bloomberg. He has repeatedly said he supports such
constraints on elected leaders, dismissed the idea that anyone is
indispensable and once called an effort to revise it by the New
York City Council "disgusting."
</P>
<P>
People briefed on the matter said Bloomberg, 66, would seek to
change the law through legislation in the council. His staff is
drafting an unusual bill that would apply only to those currently
in office, allowing them to serve three terms instead of two. But
the measure would require voter approval for the change to become
permanent, these people said.
</P>
<P>
Bloomberg's strategy carries significant political risk. Several
polls, conducted over the last few months, show widespread
support for keeping the law in place. City voters passed term
limits by overwhelming margins in 1993, and reaffirmed their
support in 1996.
</P>
<P>
"A backdoor deal undermines the will of New Yorkers," said the
New York City comptroller, William C. Thompson Jr., who plans to
run for mayor next year. "Democracy," he added, "is bigger than
any one person."
</P>
<P>
Yet it remains unclear who can stop the popular Bloomberg from
changing the law and coasting to an election victory next year.
The concept of a third term has broad support among City Council
members, business leaders and newspaper editorial boards, all of
whom Bloomberg has assiduously courted behind the scenes. On
Wednesday, the editorial board of The New York Times will call
for abolishing term limits. The New York Post and the New York
Daily News have already endorsed Bloomberg's bid for a third
term.
</P>
<P>
And, according to a person who has advised the mayor in the past,
he "does not care what it costs" to win a third term. In 2005,
Bloomberg, a billionaire, spent more than $70 million and won
nearly 60 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
Bloomberg was observing the Jewish New Year on Tuesday and his
spokesman did not return several e-mail messages and telephone
calls.
</P>
<P>
During marathon telephone conversations in recent weeks,
Bloomberg has debated with his friends and advisers the pros and
cons of running again.
</P>
<P>
"This has been thoroughly thought out by the mayor," said the
person who has advised the mayor in the past. "It's not like he
just woke up one morning and decided to do it."
</P>
<P>
With his decision, Bloomberg is overruling the advice of his top
three assistants at City Hall -- deputy mayors Edward Skyler,
Patricia E. Harris and Kevin Sheekey -- who have expressed
opposition to a third term.
</P>
<P>
Those aides have told the mayor -- at times forcefully -- that
any campaign to challenge the term-limits law would look like an
end run around voters, and could sully his legacy as a reform-
minded outsider. Several have told the mayor, who prizes loyalty,
that they may not remain for a full third term.
</P>
<P>
In the business community, however, the idea of a Bloomberg third
term is intensely popular. At charity balls and on golf courses,
executives like the financier Steve Rattner, the developer Jerry
I. Speyer and the media mogul Rupert Murdoch have encouraged him
to seek a third term.
</P>
<P>
As the city's economy has become imperiled over the last two
weeks, as Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy and Merrill Lynch
was sold, calls for a third term have multiplied. Bloomberg took
pains to project an image of authority on the economy, trading
telephone calls with chief executives of Wall Street firms,
traveling to Washington to meet with federal regulators and
appearing on "Meet the Press" to field questions about the
financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Closer to home, he has warned of gaping budget deficits and
warned that he would probably raise property taxes by 7 percent
as soon as January.
</P>
<P>
"He has the confidence of the business community and the
executive ability to run the city," said Steve Ross, the chief
executive of Related Cos., a major developer in the city. "This
is a good time for him to do this. People are scared."
</P>
<P>
Even Ronald R. Lauder, the billionaire cosmetics heir who waged
the successful 1993 campaign to create term limits in the city,
has signed onto a Bloomberg third term, citing the tumultuous
economy. "I saw what was happening with the economy and with
prospects for the city," Lauder said in an interview on Tuesday.
Now, he added, "I could support the idea of a third term."
Lauder's change of heart was reported on Tuesday in the New York
Post.
</P>
<P>
According to a timetable outlined by those who have been told of
the mayor's plan, legislation calling for the extension would
probably be introduced within the next few weeks to the council,
which has already signaled its support for the change
</P>
<P>
A New York Times survey of City Council members in early
September found that a majority were willing to amend the term-
limits law, in order to allow Bloomberg and the council -- two-
thirds of whom are scheduled to be forced out of office in 2009
-- a third term.
</P>
<P>
What's more, the council committee that must first approve such a
bill is run by Councilman Simcha Felder, a strong Bloomberg ally.
Over the last seven years, the mayor has directed millions of
dollars in city money to community groups supported by Felder,
according to city records.
</P>
<P>
Bloomberg's change of heart is certain to cause chaos in the
city's political class. For months, or even years, the 35
candidates scheduled to leave office next year have been raising
millions of dollars and lining up support for their next
campaigns, whether for the state Legislature in September, or
races for mayor, comptroller and borough president in 2009. But
if the mayor succeeds in revising the law, all of those
candidates can seek a third term in their current offices.
</P>
<P>
Bloomberg's plan would have an especially deep impact on the next
mayor's race. Two candidates for mayor next year, Thompson, the
comptroller, and City Council Speaker Christine C. Quinn, would
be forced from office under term limits. Given Bloomberg's
popularity and significant financial advantage, they may choose
to sit out the mayoral campaign race once he enters the race,
political analysts said.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that most of those candidates who were thinking of
running will probably wait for the next round," said former Mayor
Ed Koch. "While Mike Bloomberg will undoubtedly have some
opposition -- there will be somebody -- I expect him to be
overwhelming re-elected."
</P>
<P>
Rep. Anthony D. Weiner, a likely mayoral candidate, said through
a spokesman that "It's illegal to run for a third term." Quinn,
through a spokesman, declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
Bloomberg's decision to modify the law is all but certain to be
used against him in the next mayoral campaign.
</P>
<P>
"The mayor has carefully crafted an image of always acting in the
public interest, but this act of circumventing the will of the
voters now calls that into question," said Dick Dadey, the
executive director of Citizens Union, a government watchdog
group.
