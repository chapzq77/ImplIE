"ItzaBitza" infuses child education with videogame fun
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

Margaret Johnson had such a tough time finding fun learning games
for her daughters that she created a company to market a game she
created that uses computer play to teach reading.
</P>
<P>
With technology powerhouse Microsoft as a partner, Johnson on
Wednesday debuted the first of what she hopes will be a line of
computer games that revives a moribund "edutainment" market for
children.
</P>
<P>
"ItzaBitza" launched by Sabi Inc. immerses children in an
animated world that they control and shape by using software
developed by Microsoft Labs.
</P>
<P>
On-screen boys and girls coax players into helping with missions
that involve drawing houses, trees or other objects brought to
animated life and into understanding increasingly sophisticated
sentences along the way.
</P>
<P>
"ItzaBitza" is Sabi's "stab at establishing a new category for
kids gaming," Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to have a fun game fine-tuned to the way children
learn," she said.
</P>
<P>
Microsoft worked with Sabi as part of an IP Ventures program that
licenses propriety technology to startups in exchange for equity
stakes in firms.
</P>
<P>
"Game-based education is a very exciting concept, and one that we
have been interested in for many years," said Microsoft chief
research and strategy officer Craig Mundie.
</P>
<P>
Sabi consulted learning specialists and brought in engineers that
worked on videogames for Microsoft's XBox 360 consoles and
computers running the Windows operating system.
</P>
<P>
They set out to create a computer game for children that bolsters
reading skills along with creative expression.
</P>
<P>
"Out of that came Living Ink, which we hope delights children in
that what they draw comes to life and they interact with it,"
Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
"What has happened in the edutainment field is games feel like
work. It is our goal and passion to establish this category of
games that children actually think are fun and, you know what,
you happen to start reading."
</P>
<P>
Some believe that the education entertainment computer game
industry has languished because titles tend to take on the
appearance of interactive school assignments based on academic
curricula.
</P>
<P>
"It's a dying field," Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
"I see it as Sabi's technology addressing a gap in the market,"
said Sharieff Mansour, director of Microsoft's IP Ventures
Program.
</P>
<P>
"There aren't that many games today that offer the rich, engaging
experience of other games with the educational component. I do
think this will resonate with parents, big time."
</P>
<P>
Popular cerebrum exercising titles such as Nintendo's "Brain Age"
are "Brain candy" aimed at getting adults to keep their minds in
shape with daily workouts, according to Johnson.
</P>
<P>
Mia Todd, a mother of four whose family tested the game, said her
children "experience something new and exciting" each time they
play the game.
</P>
<P>
"It's great to see them learning and being creative, and having
so much fun at the same time," Todd said.
</P>
<P>
Sabi, based near Microsoft's headquarters in the US state of
Washington, sees the potential to expand into fun games for
teaching children match, science, history and other subjects.
