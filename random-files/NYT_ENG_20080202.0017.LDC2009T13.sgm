It turns out that "The Eye," this month's homely Hollywood remake
of an Asian horror film, could credibly double as one of those
feminine sixth-sense TV dramas. Jessica Alba stars as Sydney
Wells, a chic blind violinist whose sight is restored in a cornea
transplant. Suddenly, those blurring images she's seeing are
trying to tell her something - and no, it's not, "Get a new
agent."
</P>
<P>
She's meant to see fires, hear voices, and be lunged at by testy
apparitions who leave handprints in spilled sugar. This isn't
terribly different from the far lazier "Over Her Dead Body," a
romantic comedy about a psychic and a dead woman that also opened
yesterday. (Unlike "The Eye," it was actually screened for movie
critics.)
</P>
<P>
The original "Eye" was a moody mediocre stab at supernatural
dread from Danny and Oxide Pang, Thai-born twins working out of
Hong Kong. Slow, vague, and without a legitimate chill or a
surprise, the movie was a drag. This American version has been
directed by David Moreau and Xavier Palud, two Europeans who've
transplanted the story (wanly adapted by Sebastian Gutierrez),
the corneas, and the mediocrity (are those death-ghosts from the
afterlife or Roswell?). Their movie is watchable - never more
gratuitously so than when Alba is filmed showering and slipping
into a tank top. But we've been here before, no?
</P>
<P>
Moreau and Palud's first film together was an ultimately
underwhelming exercise in terror called "Them." It's a notch
above this, their Hollywood debut. The noise and cheap bumps in
the night from the Pangs' movie have been toned down, but without
them you realize that atmosphere was all the Pangs had going for
them. Now "The Eye" is a pilot for another show about a sexy
woman who sees - or is obsessed with - the dead. But Alba, with
her ethereal beauty, is no Patricia Arquette ("Medium") or Jill
Hennessy ("Crossing Jordan"). She could give Jennifer Love Hewitt
("Ghost Whisperer") a run for her money in the girlishness
department.
</P>
<P>
But even Hewitt's face has a range of feeling. Her voice has
pleasingly rich character. When Alba talks, no matter what she's
actually saying, it usually sounds like she's asking, "Does this
come in a two?" She narrates "The Eye." And it speaks volumes
about her directors' tone deafness that they play up what will
never be Alba's strong suit. "People say seeing is believing...
Now I see using my other senses... I bet music looks beautiful."
All I can see is jeans.
</P>
<P>
Alba spends a lot of her scenes with Parker Posey, who plays
Sydney's guilty sister; Alessandro Nivola, who plays her sight
therapist; or Rachel Ticotin, in a small part (where's she been?)
as, well, some unhappy Mexican lady. They all look like they'd
rather be somewhere else. But they are here enough for you to
appreciate the experience in their faces versus the disruptive
purity in their costar's.
</P>
<P>
As a performer, Alba still seems to be figuring out what she's
good at. One thing going for her is the uncommon, unblemished
niceness she radiates on screen. It's terrible for horror or
action or comedy or drama. But it's perfect for, say, water. She
was never more convincing than she was as Paul Walker's moral-
minded girlfriend in the tropical thriller "Into the Blue." She
had little to say and little to wear, but she'd found her calling
as a good-hearted mermaid. If she's going to keep doing fright
movies, maybe she can be the Esther Williams of horror.
