HANS BLIX, U.N. ARMS INSPECTOR, RETIRES
</HEADLINE>

After a career in international diplomacy spanning 40 years, the last
three as the chief weapons inspector for the United Nations in Iraq,
Hans Blix retired on Monday with the expiration of his U.N. contract.
Blix, a Swedish expert on international law, spent most of the day
giving interviews.

<P>
In his periodic reports to the Security Council after inspection teams
returned to Iraq in November, Blix stressed that though Iraqi
cooperation had fallen short of council demands, his team had found no
conclusive evidence of active chemical or biological weapons programs.
After U.S.-led efforts to pass a resolution approving a military
assault unraveled, some of its supporters seemed to consider the
dispassionate Blix partly to blame.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. administration in Iraq has not invited Blix or his inspectors
to return, and unless the matter is formally resolved in the Security
Council, which is unlikely, the United Nations will not name a
permanent replacement for him.
</P>

Associates say Blix, 75, will return to his home in Sweden, where he
will write a book about his career, which included 16 years as
director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency. He will
also indulge in his hobbies of hiking and cooking, especially making
his own marmalade.
