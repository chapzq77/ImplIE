Niger rebels release 25 soldiers who had been taken hostage 9

<P>
Tuareg rebels in Niger released 25 soldiers who were taken
hostage nine months ago in the country's troubled northern
desert, the government said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Their release comes just days after Tuareg rebels in Mali,
Niger's neighbor, released 22 hostages last week -- the last of
about 40 soldiers and government officials taken prisoner in
August raids.
</P>
<P>
The hostages released Monday were flown to Niamey, Niger's
capital, on a Libyan plane, suggesting the role that Libyan
leader Moammar Gadhafi played in the negotiation. In neighboring
Mali, the government thanked Gadhafi for "his brotherly work" in
ending the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Abouba Albade, Niger's Minister of the Interior and Security,
held a ceremony at the airport to welcome home the 25 hostages.
He, too, thanked a foundation set up by Gadhafi for the men's
release.
</P>
<P>
The Tuaregs, the light-skinned nomads that have made a home out
of the Sahara desert, have long been at odds with the darker-
skinned rulers of the band of countries cutting across their
native sand dunes -- especially in Mali and Niger. The latest
spate of hostage takings began last year following a resurgence
of hostilities between the ethnic Tuareg rebels and the
government of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Gadhafi, Libya's leader, has long been rumored to be providing
logistical support to the rebels.
</P>
<P>
Albade said that Niger "wanted to reiterate the gratitude it
feels toward the Gadhafi foundation for its good work." But the
minister rejected the possibility of a directly negotiating with
the Niger Movement for Justice, known by its French acronym of
MNJ, who grabbed the 25 hostages during a raid last June.
</P>
<P>
He said the government would only negotiate with these rebels
once they put down their arms. Six hostages remain in MNJ
custody.
