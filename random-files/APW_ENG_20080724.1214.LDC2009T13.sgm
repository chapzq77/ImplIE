Elan says 2Q sales grow, MS drug to become US$1 billion
`blockbuster '  soon

DUBLIN, Ireland 2008-07-24 18:42:40 UTC
</P>
<P>
Biopharmaceutical company Elan Corp. PLC. reported narrowing
second-quarter losses Thursday as sales surged for its multiple
sclerosis-fighting drug, Tysabri.
</P>
<P>
Revenues rose 30 percent to US$245.6 million (euro156.6 million)
in the April-June quarter, chiefly because of Tysabri, which is
produced and distributed in alliance with U.S. drugmaker Biogen
Idec Inc.
</P>
<P>
Elan cut its losses nearly in half to US$71.5 million (euro45.6
million), compared to a US$141.1 million loss in the second
quarter of 2007. Executives said they hoped to report narrower
full-year losses and a 2009 return to profit -- which would be
Elan's first since the company nearly went bankrupt amid an
accounting scandal in 2002.
</P>
<P>
The fate of Ireland's largest pharmaceutical company rests with
Tysabri, which appears finally on the verge of attaining Elan's
ambition of a "blockbuster" drug that exceeds US$1 billion (the
equivalent of euro650,000) in annual sales.
</P>
<P>
About 32,000 sufferers of MS, an incurable disease that attacks
the central nervous system causing sudden partial paralysis, are
already taking Tysabri, nearly triple the level of 12 months ago.
</P>
<P>
Chief Financial Officer Shane Cooke said Elan hoped to reach
100,000 Tysabri customers by the end of 2010, while current
projections pointed to 90,000.
</P>
<P>
It's a strong turnaround from 2005, when Elan faced potential
financial ruin over the surprise withdrawal of Tysabri. Three
clinical users of Tysabri contracted a rare brain disease called
PML, and two died.
</P>
<P>
But Elan and Biogen have reported no new cases since Tysabri's
return to the market under restricted conditions in June 2006.
</P>
<P>
Cooke said neurologists and their MS patients in North America
and Europe were increasingly confident that Tysabri -- widely
acknowledged from the start as better at suppressing the effects
of MS than older treatments -- was safe when used on its own. The
three PML victims were simultaneously taking another MS-fighting
drug; such combined therapy has been banned since 2005.
</P>
<P>
"The further we go (without any new PML cases), the more
comfortable that people become and the more that patients demand
to be put on Tysabri," Cooke said in a telephone interview with
The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
Cooke estimated there were 500,000 MS sufferers in the 35
countries where Tysabri has been approved for sale, split evenly
between North America and Europe. He said close to 7 percent were
already receiving Tysabri, while its end-of-2010 target means 20
percent would be.
</P>
<P>
Cooke said the treatment, which is administered every four weeks
by intravenous infusion, retails for about US$30,000 (euro20,000)
annually per patient following a recent 3 percent price rise.
</P>
<P>
He downplayed the restrictions placed on Tysabri's use by the
U.S. Food and Drug Administration and European regulators, noting
that specialist clinics do have leeway to prescribe the drug as a
first resort and were increasingly doing so.
</P>
<P>
U.S. regulators in January also approved Tysabri for the most
serious sufferers of an intestinal disorder called Crohn's
disease, and Elan said about 100 Crohn's patients are using the
drug today.
</P>
<P>
Elan's spending on research and development increased 36 percent
to US$81.2 million (euro51.8 million), chiefly reflecting efforts
to produce treatments and a potential cure for the brain-
destroying Alzheimer's disease.
</P>
<P>
Elan and its research partner, Wyeth, plan to present second-
phase results for one potential Alzheimer's treatment,
bapineuzumab, at a Chicago conference for neurologists Tuesday.
The drug has already advanced to a final round of clinical
trials.
</P>
<P>
Elan Chief Executive Kelly Martin said the company had spent 15
years researching to combat Alzheimer's, which afflicts an
estimated 15 million people worldwide, a figure expected to
double at least within the next decade.
</P>
<P>
"The Alzheimer's need is, unfortunately, immense," Martin said.
"It is probably the largest single market that's as yet untapped
by the biopharmaceutical industry."
</P>
<P>
Elan has been the star performer on the Irish Stock Exchange over
the past year, rising nearly 40 percent during a period when the
overall Dublin market has lost half its value.
</P>
<P>
But Elan shares suffered their biggest drop in seven months
Thursday, closing down 8.8 percent at euro20.12 (US$31.49).
Traders attributed the fall to profit-taking, wider market losses
and analyst concerns that next week's Alzheimer's data might
deliver mixed news.
