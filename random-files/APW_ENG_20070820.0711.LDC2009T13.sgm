<HEADLINE>
Canadian prime minister to assert Arctic claim in summit with US,
Mexican presidents
</HEADLINE>

MONTEBELLO, Quebec 2007-08-20 14:33:21 UTC

<P>
Canada's prime minister is expected to assert his nation's claim
to the fabled Northwest Passage through the warming, resource-
rich Arctic at talks with the presidents of the United States and
Mexico starting Monday.
</P>
<P>
Canada claimed the passage in 1973 but competition to control the
Arctic has intensified with global warming. Shrinking polar ice
has raised the possibility of new shipping lanes and development
of what one U.S. study suggested could be as much as 25 percent
of the world's undiscovered oil and gas.
</P>
<P>
Russia sent two small submarines to plant a tiny national flag
under the North Pole this month. Denmark sent a team of
scientists to the Arctic ice pack this month to seek evidence
that the Lomonosov Ridge, an underwater mountain range, is
attached to the Danish territory of Greenland.
</P>
<P>
Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper went to the Arctic earlier
this month and announced Canada will build a new army training
center and a deep-water port in the Northwest passage.
</P>
<P>
The summit involving Harper, U.S. President George W. Bush and
Mexican President Felipe Calderon is largely about expanding
economic cooperation among the three nations, but Harper will
assert Canada's claim during a private meeting with Bush,
Canadian officials said at a press briefing on the summit.
</P>
<P>
As the summit approached, Calderon was considering cutting his
trip short to return to Mexico, where Hurricane Dean was poised
to slam into the coastline. Calderon will make a decision about
his plans once the hurricane draws closer to Mexico, his press
office said.
</P>
<P>
The United States and Norway also have claims in the Arctic, and
the U.S. says the passage is not Canadian.
</P>
<P>
"It is a strait for international navigation," U.S. Ambassador
David Wilkins said in an interview. "That's not a unique view of
the United States. That is the view shared by a majority of the
countries in the world."
</P>
<P>
Bush's previous U.S. ambassador to Canada, Paul Cellucci,
however, argued that the U.S. should acknowledge the Northwest
Passage as Canadian. Such a stance would allow the Canadian navy
to patrol the area, monitor shipping and guard against potential
terrorism and weapons smuggling, he said.
</P>
<P>
"I think, in the age of terrorism, it's in our security interests
that the Northwest Passage be considered part of Canada,"
Cellucci, a Bush appointee who left the position in 2005, told
Canadian television.
</P>
<P>
Harper has said Canada's new military installations will help
back up Canada's claim to the waters and natural resources of the
Northwest Passage, which runs below the North Pole from the
Atlantic to the Pacific through the Arctic archipelago.
</P>
<P>
Stephen Clarkson, a political scientist at the University of
Toronto, said bringing up the Arctic is a way for Harper to show
Canadians he's not too close to the unpopular president.
</P>
<P>
"It's a gratuitous way to create a little distance between
himself and Bush," Clarkson said.
</P>
<P>
Bush will meet privately with Calderon at Fairmont Le Chateau
Montebello, a small summer retreat on the banks of the Ottawa
river.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government is poised to offer a major aid plan to Mexico
to fight drug trafficking and violence. Bush may announce part or
all the proposal during the summit if the details are completed
in time. The effort is expected to help pay for equipment and
training.
</P>
<P>
For Bush, the summit with Canada and Mexico allows him to show he
does not take his neighbors for granted; they are both vital
trading partners and energy providers for the U.S.
</P>
<P>
"The message for Canada and Mexico is that despite the ongoing
emphasis on Iraq and terrorism in U.S. foreign policy ... the
U.S. is investing time and attention on relationships with our
own region," said Chris Sands, a scholar of North American
studies and senior associate at the Center for Strategic and
International Studies.
</P>
<P>
The partnership of the countries is a framework for working out
problems -- not a deal that was ever intended to produce dramatic
announcements. None are expected at the summit.
</P>
<P>
Personally, Bush shares plenty of views with Harper and Calderon,
two fellow conservatives and free-market advocates who have come
into power during his second term.
</P>
<P>
It is not all cheery. The summit is drawing protests from critics
of Canada's troop presence in Afghanistan and of the partnership
among the three countries. Some Canadians see it as an insidious
threat to their sovereignty, led by the United States.
</P>
<P>
Police were out in force Sunday in Ottawa, where protests began
even before Bush was to arrive Monday from his ranch in Crawford,
Texas. The summit itself will take place about 50 miles (80
kilometers) to the east at a luxury resort in Montebello, Quebec,
where security is even tighter.
