SHANGHAI, Sept. 30 (Xinhua)
</P>
<P>
Following are the facts and figures of the women's world cup
final between Germany and Brazil here on Sunday:
</P>
<P>
This is the sixth head-to-head between the two teams at senior
level. The five matches, all of them competitive, resulted in
three German wins and two draws.
</P>
<P>
Germany and Brazil is already for the third time on a FIFA
Women's World Cup schedule: in 1995, Germany won 6-1, in 1999
they drew 3-3, both at group stage. In the 1996 Olympic Football
Tournament they tied 1-1 in the first round while Germany won
both matches in 2000 (2-1 and 2-0), the latter being the Bronze
Medal match.
</P>
<P>
The only win by a Brazilian women's team was at the FIFA U-20
Women's World Cup Canada 2002 where they won 1-0 at group stage
but lost to Germany two weeks later in the third-place playoff on
penalties.
</P>
<P>
Germany's Birgit Prinz scored at least one goal in four of the
five matches against Brazil: the opener in the 6-1 at the FIFA
Women's World Cup 1995 and the 3-3 draw in 1999. In the Olympic
Football Tournament 2000 she marked both goals in a 2-1 group
match win and the second in the 2-0 Bronze Medal match (the first
one coming from Renate Lingor).
</P>
<P>
Brazil's Marta is the seventh player to score 10 goals in the
FIFA Women's World Cup and the third non-European after Michelle
Akers/USA (12) and Sun Wen/CHN (11).
</P>
<P>
Birgit Prinz looks set to become the first player to appear in
three Finals: in 1995 she played 42 minutes against Norway and
was of course of crucial importance in the 2003 Final against
Sweden. Two others of Germany's players were present in both
previous finals, but Sandra Minnert was an unused sub in 1995 as
was Sandra Smisek in 2003.
</P>
<P>
The own goal by American defender Leslie Osborne in the semi-
final marked Brazil's 100 th goal in a FIFA women's competition.
They break down into 46 World Cup goals (2.2 per match), 30 at
the Under-20 level (1.7) and 27 in Olympic Football tournaments
(1.7). The values for Germany are higher across the board: 82
World Cup goals (3.0), 44 in Under-20 competitions (2.8) and 28
in Olympic matches (2.2).
</P>
<P>
This is the first Final in a FIFA women's competition pairing a
European and a South American team.
</P>
<P>
The best two attacking teams have made it to the Final: so far,
Germany have scored 19 goals and Brazil 17. This is the second
time that two teams with the best goal record meet in the Final.
In 1999, China (19 goals) met hosts USA (18) but subsequently
neither of them managed to find the net in 120 minutes.
</P>
<P>
Germany could become the first team to win two consecutive titles
in a FIFA women's competition: no World Cup winner or Olympic
Gold medal winner has ever managed to defend the title.
</P>
<P>
For Germany, this is the the third FIFA Women's World Cup Final
and their fourth overall (Germany won the 2004 FIFA U-20 World
Cup in Thailand). Brazil play their first FIFA Women's World Cup
Final. They finished 3rd in 1999 and lost the 2004 Olympic Final.
</P>
<P>
Germany hold yet another record as they have not conceded a goal
for 529 minutes. The last FWWC goal scored against Germany was in
the 2003 Final shortly before the half-time break by Sweden's
Hanna Ljungberg. The previous record was held by China who kept a
clean sheet during 442 minutes between 1999 and 2003.
