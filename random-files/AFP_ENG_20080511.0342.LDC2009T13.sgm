Serbian President Boris Tadic, the flag-bearer of the pro-
European camp in crucial general elections on Sunday, expressed
confidence of victory over nationalist forces.
</P>
<P>
"I am totally sure that people of Serbia are going to vote for
their European future, and also to contribute in terms of our
capability to defend our legitimate interest in Kosovo, to defend
our territorial integrity and sovereignty," Tadic told foreign
reporters after voting in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
"These elections are going to be vitally important for my
country," said Tadic, who is also the leader of the Democratic
Party (DS), which heads an alliance of pro-European forces.
</P>
<P>
"We have two main goals: to defend territorial integrity and
sovereignty in Kosovo, to find a compromise solution in
negotiating process with Albanians in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"We have an interest and our strategic goal is to become a member
state of the European Union. I am not going to give up in
achieving these two goals and I am totally sure that people in
Serbia are going to vote for that policy."
</P>
<P>
Running on the ticket "For a European Serbia," the Tadic-backed
alliance is neck-and-neck with the ultra-nationalist Radical
Party, each credited with around one third of the vote, according
to latest surveys.
</P>
<P>
Like his nationalist rivals, Tadic also opposes the independence
of Kosovo, but not at the expense of the Balkan country's
integration into the 27-nation European Union.
