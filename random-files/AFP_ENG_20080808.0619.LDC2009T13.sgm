Olympics: Australian chief hits out over pollution
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Australian Olympic Committee president John Coates on Friday hit
out at the heavy smog shrouding Beijing, saying it could
permanently damage the environment.
</P>
<P>
Coates, an International Olympic Committee member, said he hoped
a legacy of the Beijing Olympics would be that China takes more
care in future.
</P>
<P>
When asked if organisers had done enough to clean up the
pollution, he said: "No. But I don't know what more thay can do.
</P>
<P>
"It may well be permanent damage. Significant pollution is a
problem, but we're getting on with it.
</P>
<P>
"Let's hope one legacy of the Games will be the realisation of
the damage that has been done to the environment and will
continue to be done unless they are more careful."
</P>
<P>
Coates' comments appear to fly in the face of the official line
taken by the IOC, with the organisation's chief Jacques Rogge on
Thursday hailing Beijing's "extraordinary" effort to cut
pollution.
</P>
<P>
Air quality has been one of the top concerns for the 10,500
athletes coming to Beijing for the Olympics, with Rogge fanning
those worries last year when he said endurance events could be
postponed if the pollution was heavy.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese authorities have done everything that is feasible
and humanly possible to address this situation. What they have
done is extraordinary," Rogge told reporters.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, the head of the World Health Organisation (WHO)
in China told AFP that the pollution could hinder athletes during
the Olympics, and that the long-term dangers to the population of
the city were serious.
</P>
<P>
"There is an air pollution problem in Beijing," Hans Troedsson
said.
</P>
<P>
"However, we are missing the point by having so much attention on
the short-term exposure while the long-term exposure is really
ignored -- that is where we have a problem," the Swede said.
</P>
<P>
Du Shaozhong, deputy director of the Beijing Municipal
Environmental Protection Bureau, insisted that air quality in
Beijing was in line with WHO standards and said measures in place
were designed to tackle the issue long-term.
</P>
<P>
"Most measures we have taken are long-term measures. These long-
term measures won't be terminated just because the Olympic Games
have come to an end," he said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Beijing has shut down many polluting industries and taken
millions of cars off the road in an effort to improve air quality
for the Games.
</P>
<P>
Despite concerns, Coates added that no one on the Australian team
had so far suffered any respiratory problems as a result of the
smog.
