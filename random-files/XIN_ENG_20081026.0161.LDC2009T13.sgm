An exhibition was held in Quanzhou City of eastern China's Fujian
Province on Saturday to mark the 63rd anniversary of Taiwan's
recovery from Japanese occupation.

The exhibition includes displaying of 123 pictures and about 100
pieces of ethnical relics and historical documents on the
development of Taiwan and the exchanges between people from the
mainland and Taiwan.

China was forced to cede Taiwan, a piece of Chinese territory
since ancient times, to Japan when it lost the Sino-Japanese War
of 1894-1895.

<P>
The island province returned to China in 1945 following Japan's
unconditional surrender in the Second World War. A formal
restoration ceremony was held on Oct. 25 that year for the then
KMT (Kuomintang) regime to accept the surrender of the Japanese
forces in Taiwan.

Kao Chin Su-mei, a renowned Taiwanese who heads a delegation to
visit the exhibition, said the path to Taiwan's recovery has been
a miserable experience, particularly for the aboriginal Taiwanese
people.

<P>
"The exhibition is to remind people not to forget this part of
history. I hope that the cross-Strait relations will develop in
peace, and only a peaceful development of such relations can be
called the real recovery," she said.

The exhibition is held in the China Museum for Fujian-Taiwan
Kinship in Quanzhou.
