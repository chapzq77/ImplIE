RugbyU: IRB agrees global rollout of new rule trials
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The International Rugby Board (IRB) Council said Thursday it had
approved a global trial of Experimental Law Variations (ELVs)
designed to reduce the number of turnover situations in a match
for a 12-month period starting on August 1, 2008.The trial will
cover all levels and involve 13 of the 23 ELVs, dubbed
Stellenbosch after the South African university where the rules
were first tested out.
</P>
<P>
The new rules were introduced on an experimental basis in
approved tournaments around the world since 2006 and now will be
rolled out in the northern hemisphere, the IRB said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
"The Council's decision to implement a global trial of
Experimental Law Variations represents an important milestone for
the future of the Game. It vindicates the process that was
adopted by Council in 2004 for future Law amendments. The Council
congratulated the Law Project Group on its unprecedented work
over the past two years," said IRB Chairman Bernard Lapasset.
</P>
<P>
The ELVs are essentially designed to help promote more ball in
play and attractive free-flowing rugby and have already been
trialled in the southern hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
The IRB added it had agreed that ELVs concerning sanctions not
already approved for global trials would be further trialled in a
selected elite Northern Hemisphere competition in the 2008/09
season.
</P>
<P>
The IRB continued: "The Southern Hemisphere will continue to play
under the various ELV programme environments that exist in that
part of the world at present. It would be unfair to change the
playing environment under which countries in the south are
currently playing in competitions such as the Super 14."
</P>
<P>
The rule changes came after a laws study group was tasked with
suggesting changes to speed up the game while reducing the
influence of penalty-kicks which would in future only result from
foul play and offside. Other offences would merit a free-kick or
scrum award.
