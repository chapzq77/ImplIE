EX-TRADE ENVOY PICKED AS HEAD OF WORLD BANK
</HEADLINE>

WASHINGTON
</P>
<P>
President Bush has chosen Robert B. Zoellick, a senior diplomat
and trade envoy who became a top Goldman Sachs executive last
year, to lead the World Bank and try to heal the bitter rifts
left by the ouster of Paul D. Wolfowitz, the administration said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. said that Zoellick had
emerged as the first choice of economic ministers around the
world, who have been calling for someone to overcome the bank's
credibility problems among donor and recipient countries alike.
</P>
<P>
"Bob has a very strong track record working with colleagues and
leaders to get results," Paulson said in an interview after word
of the appointment spread. "He's got great energy and enthusiasm
and will be able to hit the ground running. I also think he's got
strong management capabilities."
</P>
<P>
Zoellick, 53, has served in high-ranking foreign policy and
economic policy posts under three Republican presidents,
beginning with Ronald Reagan. His selection is to be officially
announced by Bush on Wednesday. He plans to visit the bank and
meet with its staff almost immediately, administration officials
said, and the bank's 24-member board of directors is to vote on
the nomination soon afterward.
</P>
<P>
He faces an institution not only riven by the travails of
Wolfowitz, who resigned earlier this month amid charges of
favoritism, but also by major disagreements among donor nations
over its future mission.
</P>
<P>
The bank lends about $23 billion a year to poor countries and is
the principal vehicle for grants and loans to the poorest among
them. But the bank is also facing challenges in raising $30
billion over the next three years to renew its lending for the
poorest countries. Many rich countries had balked at new lending
while Wolfowitz remained in charge.
</P>
<P>
Zoellick served for six years in the current Bush administration,
as U.S. trade representative from 2001 to 2005 and then as deputy
secretary of state until last July. Under Presidents Reagan and
George H. W. Bush, he held top posts at the Treasury and State
departments. He is known as tough, strong-willed, demanding and
occasionally abrasive, but has built a broad network of admirers
and allies around the world during his years in the government.
