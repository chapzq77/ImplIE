Hurricane Bertha was nearly stationary off Bermuda on Saturday
but is still likely to create tropical storm conditions as it
heads east of the Atlantic island, forecasters said.
</P>
<P>
Surfers and swimmers remained in the water under sunny skies on
Friday despite reports of stronger surf and rip currents along
the southern coast.

"I'm not concerned at all," said John Wilson, a native of
Winston-Salem, North Carolina, who was vacationing in the capital
of the wealthy British territory. "If you're going to be on an
island during a hurricane, the best thing is to be in a hotel
with a nice minibar. And I'm on the second floor, so the waves
won't hit me!"
</P>
<P>
Early Saturday, Bertha's center was about 220 miles (360
kilometers) southeast of Bermuda. Forecasters said tropical storm
conditions are possible on the island by late Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
Bertha had maximum sustained winds of about 90 mph (150 kph) with
some higher gusting. The storm was barely moving but expected to
chug north-northwest at about 5 mph (7 kph) later in the day, the
U.S. National Hurricane Center said.
</P>
<P>
The storm is expected to pass well east of Bermuda, although any
inclination toward the west would create stronger winds. Bermuda
will likely receive up to 2 inches (5 centimeters) of rain in the
next two days.
</P>
<P>
"We're on tropical storm watch, but not hurricane watch and
that's a plus," said 47-year-old Joanne Cook from New Jersey.
"I'll take that."
</P>
<P>
She said Bertha had only brought bothersome things like large
amounts of jellyfish and lionfish.
</P>
<P>
Bertha became the Atlantic season's first hurricane on July 7 and
has vacillated between a Category 1 and 2 storm. The first named
storm this year, Arthur, formed in the Atlantic the day before
the season officially started June 1 and soaked the Yucatan
Peninsula.
