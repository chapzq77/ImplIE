Losing My Jihadism

BURAIDAH, Saudi Arabia
</P>
<P>
Islam needs a Reformation. It needs someone with the courage of
Martin Luther.
</P>
<P>
This is the belief I've arrived at after a long and painful
spiritual journey. It's not a popular conviction -- it has
attracted angry criticism, including death threats, from many
sides. But it was reinforced by Sept. 11, 2001, and in the years
since, I've only become more convinced that it is critical to
Islam's future.
</P>
<P>
Muslims are too rigid in our adherence to old, literal
interpretations of the Koran. It's time for many verses --
especially those having to do with relations between Islam and
other religions -- to be reinterpreted in favor of a more modern
Islam. It's time to accept that God loves the faithful of all
religions. It's time for Muslims to question our leaders and
their strict teachings, to reach our own understanding of the
prophet's words and to call for a bold renewal of our faith as a
faith of goodwill, of peace and of light.
</P>
<P>
I didn't always think this way. Once, I was one of the extremists
who clung to literal interpretations of Islam and tried to force
them on others. I was a jihadist.
</P>
<P>
I grew up in Saudi Arabia. When I was 16, I found myself assailed
by doubts about the existence of God. I prayed to God to give me
the strength to overcome them. I made a deal with Him: I would
give up everything, devote myself to Him and live the way the
prophet Muhammad and his companions had lived 1,400 years ago if
He would rid me of my doubts.
</P>
<P>
I joined a hard-line Salafi group. I abandoned modern life and
lived in a mud hut, apart from my family. Viewing modern
education as corrupt and immoral, I joined a circle of scholars
who taught the Islamic sciences in the classical way, just as
they had been taught 1,200 years ago. My involvement with this
group led me to violence, and landed me in prison. In 1991, I
took part in firebombing video stores in Riyadh and a women's
center in my home town of Buraidah, seeing them as symbols of sin
in a society that was marching rapidly toward modernization.
</P>
<P>
Yet all the while, my doubts remained. Was the Koran really the
word of God? Had it really been revealed to Muhammad, or did he
create it himself? But I never shared these doubts with anyone,
because doubting Islam or the prophet is not tolerated in the
Muslim society of my country.
</P>
<P>
By the time I turned 26, much of the turmoil in me had abated,
and I made my peace with God. At the same time, my eyes were
opened to the hypocrisy of so many who held themselves out as
Muslim role models. I saw Islamic judges ignoring the marks of
torture borne by my prison comrades. I learned of Islamic
teachers who molested their students. I heard devout Muslims who
never missed the five daily prayers lying with ease to people who
did not share their extremist beliefs.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, when I was working as an imam at a Riyadh mosque, I
happened upon two books that had a profound influence on me. One,
written by a Palestinian scholar, was about the struggle between
those who deal pragmatically with the Koran and those who take it
and the hadith literally. The other was a book by a Moroccan
philosopher about the formation of the Arab Muslim way of
thinking.
</P>
<P>
The books inspired me to write an article for a Saudi newspaper
arguing that Muslims have the right to question and criticize our
religious leaders and not to take everything they tell us for
granted. We owe it to ourselves, I wrote, to think pragmatically
if our religion is to survive and thrive.
</P>
<P>
That article landed me in the center of a storm. Some men in my
mosque refused to greet me. Others would no longer pray behind
me. Under this pressure, I left the mosque.
</P>
<P>
I moved to the southern city of Abha, where I took a job as a
writer and editor with a newly established newspaper. I went back
to leading prayers at the paper's small mosque and to writing
about my evolving philosophy. After I wrote articles stressing
our right as Muslims to question our Saudi clerics and their
interpretations and to come up with our own, officials from the
kingdom's powerful religious establishment complained, and I was
banned from writing.
</P>
<P>
The attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, gave new life to what I had been
saying. I went back to criticizing the rote manner in which we
Muslims are fed our religion. I criticized al-Qaida's school of
thought, which considers everyone who isn't a Salafi Muslim the
enemy. I pointed to examples from Islamic history that stressed
the need to get along with other religions. I tried to give a new
interpretation to the verses that call for enmity between Muslims
and Christians and Jews. I wrote that they do not apply to us
today and that Islam calls for friendship among all religions.
</P>
<P>
I lost a lot of friends after that. My old companions from the
jihad felt obliged to declare themselves either with me or
against me. Some preferred to cut their links to me silently, but
others fought me publicly, issuing statements filled with curses
and lies. Once again, the paper came under great pressure to ban
my writing. And I became a favorite target on the Internet, where
my writings were lambasted and labeled blasphemous.
</P>
<P>
Eventually I was fired. But by then, I had started to develop a
different relationship with God. I felt that He was moving me
toward another kind of belief, where all that matters is that we
pray to God from the heart. I continued to pray, but I started to
avoid the verses that contain violence or enmity and only used
the ones that speak of God's mercy and grace and greatness. I
remembered an incident when the prophet told a Bedouin who didn't
know how to pray to let go of the verses and simply to think of
God and get closer to Him by repeating, ``God is good, God is
great.'' Don't sweat the details, the prophet said.
</P>
<P>
I felt at peace, and no longer doubted the existence of God.
</P>
<P>
In December 2002, in a Web site interview, I criticized al-Qaida
and declared that some of the Friday sermons were loathsome
because of their attacks against non-Muslims. Within days, a
fatwa was posted online, calling me an infidel and saying that I
should be killed. Once again, I felt despair at the ways of the
Muslim world. Two years later, I told al-Arabiya television that
I thought God loves all faithful people of different religions.
That earned me a fatwa from the mufti of Saudi Arabia declaring
my infidelity.
</P>
<P>
But one evening not long after that, I heard a radio broadcast of
the verse of light. Even though I had memorized the Koran at 15,
I felt as though I was hearing this verse for the first time. God
is light, it says, the universe is illuminated by His light. I
felt the verse was speaking directly to me, sending me a message.
This God of light, I thought, how could He be against any human?
The God of light would not be happy to see people suffer, even if
they had sinned and made mistakes along the way.
</P>
<P>
I had found my Islam. And I believe that others can find it, too.
But first we need a Reformation similar to the Protestant
Reformation that Martin Luther led against the Roman Catholic
Church.
</P>
<P>
In the late 14th century, Islam had its own sort of Martin
Luther. Ibn Taymiyya was an Islamic scholar from a hard-line
Salafi sect who went through a spiritual crisis and came to
believe that in time, God would close the gates of hell and grant
all humans, regardless of their religion, entry to his
everlasting paradise. Unlike Luther, however, Ibn Taymiyya never
openly declared this revolutionary belief; he shared it only with
a small, trusted circle of students.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, I find myself inspired by Luther's courageous
uprising. I see what Islam needs -- a strong, charismatic
personality who will lead us toward reform, and scholars who can
convince Islamic communities of the need for a bold new
interpretation of Islamic texts, to reconcile us with the wider
world.
