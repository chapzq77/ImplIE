GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip 2008-05-21 11:58:07 UTC
</P>
<P>
Five Palestinians, including a 5-month-old baby girl, were
wounded in an Israeli airstrike against militants.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli military said they hit militants who had just fired
rockets into southern Israel.
</P>
<P>
The militant Hamas that controls Gaza said the wounded Wednesday
were civilian bystanders.
</P>
<P>
Gaza militants launch rockets and mortars into Israel almost
daily. Two Israeli civilians were killed in recent attacks in the
past two weeks, and 14 were wounded last week when a rocket hit a
mall in the southern city of Ashkelon.
</P>
<P>
Israeli airstrikes aimed to stop the rocket attacks have killed
14 Palestinians during that time.
</P>
<P>
Israel holds the Hamas militant group, which violently seized
control of Gaza last June, responsible for all violence emanating
from the area. Hamas militants clash regularly with the Israeli
military in Gaza and along its borders, and reject Israel's right
to exist.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Wednesday, Hamas said one of its members was killed on a
"holy mission." The term is used when a Hamas militant dies,
either when mishandling explosives or in a premature explosion
intended for an attack against Israel.
</P>
<P>
Despite the violence, Israeli defense officials estimated Tuesday
that an Egyptian-brokered truce could take effect in the coming
days.
