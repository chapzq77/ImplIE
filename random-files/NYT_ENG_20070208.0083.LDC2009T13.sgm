MR-MOM -- DAYTON, Ohio -- After an hour of trying to replace a
headlight bulb last week on my 2006 Honda CR-V, I finally gave up
and let my 15-year-old daughter do it. She accomplished the task
in about two minutes, but only after she made me promise to cease
cussing. I was forced to swallow my pride on at least two fronts,
bringing shame upon all men, who are supposed to have superior
mechanical skills, and to anyone ages 55 and older, a benchmark I
happened to clear that same week. (DeBrosse, Dayton Daily News)

GRAMMY-QUIZ -- ATLANTA -- The 49th annual Grammy Awards will be
handed out Sunday. Over the years, Grammy voters have made some
questionable choices - and, to be fair, quite a few good ones.
But how many of those choices do we remember? Test your knowledge
with our Grammy quiz. (Harrison, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

OFFICE-BLOG -- ATLANTA -- The folks at Dundler Mifflin may be
clueless as to the number of employment laws they break each week
on the fictional reality TV show "The Office". But not Atlanta
lawyer Julie Elgar. She's a big fan of the show and she keeps
tabs of their legal missteps in her blog, launched Feb. 2. The
blog keeps a weekly tally on how much DM management racks up in
potential legal judgments. (Joyner, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

TRENT-TOMLINSON -- WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. -- Some country artists'
careers take off like a comet blazing across the night sky. For
other artists, their careers start off slowly and build, like the
stars coming out one by one as dusk darkens into night. Trent
Tomlinson belongs in the second group. But what began as a few
faint stars has become a Milky Way of achievements. (Fontaine,
Palm Beach Post)

BOOKS-SINGLE -- DAYTON, Ohio -- She walked away from an
engagement and turned down two proposals. All with the entire
nation watching. Jen Schefft comes to town tonight to discuss her
new book "Better Single Than Sorry: A No Regrets Guide to Loving
Yourself and Never Settling." The Cleveland native and Ohio
University grad is best known as the winner of "The Bachelor" in
2003. She also starred in 2004's "The Bachelorette." (Moss,

BROWN-WILL -- James Brown still isn't buried -- and neither is
the fight to control potentially tens of millions of dollars in
future revenues generated by the music of "The Hardest-Working
Man in Show Business." Friday in Aiken, S.C., the parties that
seek to control Brown's estate will begin to duke it out for the
first time publicly since the entertainer's Dec. 25 death.

MOVIE NEWS AND REVIEWS
</P>
<P>
HANNIBAL-REVIEW -- WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. -- Do you really want to
think of Hannibal Lecter as a victim, a wronged man who is
justified in his grisly mayhem? That is the makeover Mr. Silence
of the Lambs gets in "Hannibal Rising," a new prequel that tries
to explain the guy's yen for human flesh. Although he kills for
his own amusement in later flicks, in this episode it is all
personal, as he methodically knocks off those who snuffed his
family. (Erstein, Palm Beach Post). MOVED.
</P>
<P>
BREAKING-REVIEW -- ATLANTA -- British director Anthony Minghella
has a big heart and an affinity for the Big Movie. Both "The
English Patient" and "Cold Mountain" present old-fashioned
romances set against a sweeping historical background. "Breaking
and Entering" substitutes a social conscience for romance and
takes place on a far smaller scale. Perhaps that's why it feels
so fussed over and self-conscious. (Gillespie, Atlanta Journal-
Constitution). MOVED.

<P>
FACTORY-REVIEW -- ATLANTA -- Andy Warhol would've walked out in
the first two minutes and taken Edie with him. (Gillespie,
Atlanta Journal-Constitution). MOVED.
</P>
<P>
INLAND-REVIEW -- ATLANTA -- David Lynch wrote and directed a
mesmerizing nightmare/fantasy about an aspiring actress and the
disintegration of her personality beneath the grinding gears of
Hollywood's dream machine. It was called "Mulholland Dr." Now
Lynch seems to be trying to remake the same movie, badly, under
the title "Inland Empire." (Murray, Atlanta Journal-
Constitution). MOVED.
</P>
<P>
POLLOCK-REVIEW -- WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. -- Who doesn't love a
good underdog-against-the-establishment story? Documentarian
Harry Moses has got one in the eye-opening "Who the $.%&amp;amp;
is Jackson Pollock?," which pits a foul-mouthed, tenacious,
grandmotherly retired truck driver against the art world elite.
(Erstein, Palm Beach Post). MOVED.

<P>
SIN-EATER-REVIEW -- WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. -- The latest entry
from Fox Faith films manages to sustain some suspense under the
direction of Michael Landon Jr. (Erstein, Palm Beach Post).

BECKET-REVIEW -- ATLANTA -- Culled from the they-don't-make-'em-
like-they-used-to file comes a magnificently restored version of
the 1964 historical drama "Becket." The picture is being re-
released in 30 cities around the country before finally appearing
on DVD after years of online foment from fans. (Gillespie,
