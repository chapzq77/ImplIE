The Black Family Channel will shut down and has sold its space on
cable systems to the Gospel Music Channel, the networks said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The deal makes the Gospel Music Channel available in America's 10
largest markets, and it expects to finish the year with more than
20 million subscribers, the network said.

<P>
"Gospel Music Channel embodies BFC's values, but does so on a
broader, multicultural scale," said Willie Gary, founder of the
Black Family Channel, about the shutdown.
</P>
<P>
The Gospel Music Channel is a 24-hour service that encompasses
all Christian music, from rock to gospel.
