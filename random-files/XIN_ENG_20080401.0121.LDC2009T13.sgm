UNITED NATIONS, April 1 (Xinhua)
</P>
<P>
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki- moon reiterated on Tuesday that the
UN mission in Kosovo, or UNMIK, will continue to operate in
accordance with UN Security Council resolution 1244.
</P>
<P>
"Following Kosovo's declaration of independence, UNMIK continues
to operate on the understanding that resolution 1244 ( 1999)
remains in force, unless the Security Council decides otherwise,"
Ban said in his latest report on the work of UNMIK to the
Security Council.
</P>
<P>
The secretary-general said Kosovo's declaration of independence
and subsequent events have posed significant challenges to
UNMIK's ability to exercise its administrative authority in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"The evolving reality in Kosovo is likely to have significant
operational implications for UNMIK," he said. "Pending Security
Council guidance, there might be a need for UNMIK to adjust its
operational deployment to developments and changes on the ground
in a manner consistent with the operational framework established
under resolution 1244," he said.
</P>
<P>
The UN chief said despite "a number of serious security
incidents," the overall security situation in Kosovo in recent
months "remained calm though tense."
</P>
<P>
But he stressed that any violence, whether directed at UNMIK
personnel or facilities or against members of any of Kosovo's
communities, is unacceptable and cannot be tolerated.
</P>
<P>
In that context, he urges all sides to reaffirm and act upon
their commitments to refrain from any actions or statements that
could endanger peace, lead to violence or jeopardize security in
Kosovo and the region.
</P>
<P>
He concluded by saying that the UN's efforts in Kosovo are aimed
at ensuring that the political and security situation in Kosovo
and the wider region remains stable, and that the safety and
security of the population are preserved.
</P>
<P>
Adopted in June 1999, resolution 1244 recognizes the sovereignty
and territorial integrity of Serbia and puts the breakaway
province under UN administration.
