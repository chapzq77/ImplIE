Protesters who defied Israel's blockade of the Gaza Strip to
bring aid to Palestinians last month are making a return voyage,
a trip organizer said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Free Gaza organizer Greta Berlin said about 20 protesters will
sail Wednesday from Cyprus aboard a boat named Hope for the
20-hour trip to the Palestinian territory.
</P>
<P>
Berlin said Irish Nobel peace prize winner Mairead McGuire,
Palestinian Legislative Council member Mustafa Barghouti and an
Italian opera tenor would be among the passengers.
</P>
<P>
She said protesters would deliver a consignment of medicine and
ferry Palestinians back to the east Mediterranean island on the
return trip.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman Yigal Palmor said Israel had
not decided whether or not to allow the boat into Gaza. Palmor
said he didn't know when a decision would be made, but that it
was unlikely any decision would be announced in advance.
</P>
<P>
Protesters sailed to Gaza last month to protest Israel's yearlong
blockade of Gaza imposed after the Islamic militant group Hamas
overran the territory. They hailed the trip as effectively ending
the blockade.
</P>
<P>
Israeli officials had said the decision to allow the boats to
reach Gaza and then to sail back to Cyprus was an attempt to deny
the protesters a propaganda victory.
