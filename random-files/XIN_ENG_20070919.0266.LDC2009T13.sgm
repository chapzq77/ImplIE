ANKARA, Sept. 19 (Xinhua)
</P>
<P>
Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Wednesday that
efforts were being exerted to prepare a new constitution for
Turkey, not for his Justice and Development Party (AKP).
</P>
<P>
Erdogan told a press briefing in Turkish capital of Ankara that
"We are not drafting a constitution for AKP but we set out on
this road to prepare a constitution for the Turkish Republic."
</P>
<P>
The top official said that "We are going to submit the draft
constitution to parliament after a great deal of discussion is
made on it."
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the British daily Financial Times published
on Wednesday, Erdogan said, "we want a constitution that is going
to provide and protect a state that is a democratic, secular,
social state of law."
</P>
<P>
According to the official, a wide-ranging debate would be held on
the new constitution, which is being drafted by a team led by
constitutional scholars.
</P>
<P>
Several non-governmental organizations (NGOs) have been involved
in preparing alternatives for the constitution and the European
Constitution was also taken into consideration during the
drafting process.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet is due to submit the final version of the draft by
early next week to Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan and a
referendum is expected to be held to ratify the constitution.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has had three constitutions so far and the current
constitution, which was written in the early 1980s, is the third
one which had often been criticized as being too restrictive.
</P>
<P>
The first one was adopted in the early 20th century when modern
Turkey was founded and the second one was approved after a
military coup in 1961.
