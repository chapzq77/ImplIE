MADRID, Spain 2007-02-22 11:34:03 UTC

<P>
Real Madrid midfielder Emerson has denied refusing to appear as a
substitute during the Champions League match with Bayern Munich.
</P>
<P>
TV channel Cuatro showed pictures which it said showed Emerson
declining to play after being called by Madrid coach Fabio
Capello with six minutes remaining of the game at Santiago
Bernabeu Stadium.
</P>
<P>
Madrid led the second-round first leg by 3-1 at the time but
Bayern midfielder Mark Van Bommel then scored his team's second
goal.
</P>
<P>
Emerson, who reportedly didn't want to play as he hadn't warmed
up on touchline with the rest of his teammates, said he couldn't
"understand why this has been said."
</P>
<P>
"It's not true. I'm a professional and I have never refused to
play a match and particularly not with Capello, whom I have known
for many years and who has known me," Emerson was quoted as
saying by sports daily Marca on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In a similar incident on Feb. 11, FC Barcelona striker Samuel
Eto'o faced suggestions he had refused to play as a substitute in
a league game with Racing Santander. An angry Eto'o responded two
days later by railing against coach Frank Rijkaard and
Ronaldinho.
</P>
<P>
Emerson, together with defender Fabio Cannavaro, followed Capello
in a euro20 million (US$26.2 million) transfer from Juventus to
Madrid last July.
</P>
<P>
However, the midfielder has failed to secure a first-team place
and has been whistled during matches by some Madrid fans who are
unconvinced by his displays
</P>
<P>
Emerson, 30, joined Juventus from AS Roma in 2004 and won Italian
league titles in 2005 and 2006, although Juventus was stripped of
the honors for its part in the country's match-fixing scandal.
