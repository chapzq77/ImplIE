CARACAS, Venezuela
</P>

"They made Caracas into Calcutta," the Venezuelan writer Fausto
Maso lamented in the epilogue of a recently reissued memoir of
bohemian exploits in the 1970s and 1980s along Sabana Grande, the
tree-lined boulevard that once symbolized this city's
effervescent intellectual life.
</P>
<P>
Until recently, it was hard for anyone with the nerve to exit a
subway stop on Sabana Grande to disagree with that assessment.
About 3,000 street vendors associated with black-market sales and
crime had taken over the boulevard since the start of the decade,
and the area had become emblematic of the city's decline into
lawlessness and neglect.
</P>
<P>
But at the beginning of this year, buoyed by President Hugo
Chavez's re-election victory, the local government allied with
him responded to the many complaints about the area and cleared
the vendors out. Pedestrians have flowed back, giving hope of
renewal to many people in the area.
</P>
<P>
"This place has gone from being an area in which you risked your
life to something approaching pleasurable," said Ramon Martinez,
a waiter at a restaurant on the boulevard for the last four
years.
</P>
<P>
Returning Sabana Grande to its past grandeur is no easy task in
Caracas, a city of 4 million struggling with violent crime.
Citing morgue records, newspapers here reported 265 killings last
month, which would make it one of the deadliest in the city's
recorded history. The police disputed the figure, saying that
there were 169 killings.
</P>
<P>
In Sabana Grande, pickpockets flourished under the vendors'
plastic tarps, where products like pharmaceuticals of dubious
origin, smuggled Colombian lingerie or pirated Hollywood DVDs
were available.
</P>
<P>
Considered a contingent of Chavez's urban political base, the
vendors had for several years successfully prevented the
authorities from removing them or collecting taxes. Many of the
boulevard's exclusive shops and outdoor cafes had shut down, as
their customers avoided the area.
</P>
<P>
Before the efforts began to restrict them, the city had about
150,000 of these vendors, according to Cedice, a research
organization. The vendors have created an anarchic feel to many
streets and plazas, including hundreds perched around the
National Assembly downtown, fueling criticism of a government
that preaches socialism but tolerates unfettered capitalism on
its streets.
</P>
<P>
"The government should be ashamed to be walking hand in hand with
Cuban socialism without acknowledging there are no street vendors
nor anything even remotely similar in Havana," the newspaper El
Nacional said in an editorial. "At least they should use Cuba as
an example in this respect."
</P>
<P>
Along Sabana Grande, whose name refers to a region of savannas
and tabletop mesas in southern Venezuela, the facades of Art Deco
apartments remain crumbling or covered in grit. Squatters have
occupied some abandoned buildings. But the police are more
visible, and mimes and street musicians now attract growing
crowds.
</P>
<P>
A few reminders of the boulevard's past survive, like Suma, a
cavernous bookstore, and the open-air Gran Cafe. Clearing out the
vendors has also started a debate about the boulevard's future,
with fervent supporters of the president trying to transform it
into an area for discussing the direction of Venezuelan politics.
</P>
<P>
"The vendors have a right to work, but they should be given the
opportunity to do something more creative," said Janette
Rodriguez while passing out copies of La Mancha, a leftist
newspaper. Rodriguez said the challenge was to prevent the
boulevard from again becoming "a place full of boutiques for the
bourgeoisie."
</P>
<P>
Whatever their political stripe, urban planners are enthusiastic
about reinvigorating what is considered the city's premier public
space. They point to its surviving examples of the fanciful
architecture and public art that blossomed in Caracas after World
War II, like a sculpture of dangling plastic tubes by Jesus Soto
that graces one end of Sabana Grande, or the Chacalito shopping
center, whose open-air design feels innovative more than four
decades after it was built.
</P>
<P>
Unlike other Latin American capitals that were seats of colonial
power, Caracas was long a backwater. Then oil wealth paid for the
services of Maurice Rotival, the French urban planner who
developed the city's master plan, and of Robert Moses, New York's
master builder, who advised Caracas on its freeway system.
</P>
<P>
The modern city they designed has gone through a wrenching
transformation, though, after migration surged from other
regions. The change is characterized by the growth of shantytowns
on its hills and the cloistering of the privileged in gated
communities and air-conditioned shopping malls.
</P>
<P>
"Sabana Grande has exceptional importance in the urban fabric of
Caracas," said Marcos Negron, a prominent architect here. "It's
one of the few areas where different social classes can mingle
with each other outside."
</P>
<P>
Though officials are clearing street vendors from other areas,
much of their focus has been on Sabana Grande. Critics of the
municipal government say the vendors' removal was opportunistic
because it took place only after the president won re-election in
December.
</P>
<P>
Freddy Bernal, mayor of the district encompassing the boulevard,
said political allegiances were not a factor. "This place does
not belong to those who voted for President Hugo Chavez or those
who did not," he said in a statement. "It belongs to all
Caraquenos and needs to be defended." An earlier effort would
have been difficult. "It's no secret to anyone that there were
years of madness between the government and the opposition and it
wasn't the political moment to advance," he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Many of the street vendors themselves scoff at their removal to a
nearby lot, even as city officials hang banners there saying,
"Dignifying the Popular Economy." The vendors say promises of
government loans have gone unmet.
</P>
<P>
"Chavez used the vendors," said Jairo Castro, a former vendor on
Sabana Grande who voted for Chavez in December. "We're no good to
him anymore."
</P>
<P>
Still, many residents seem delighted that Sabana Grande, and
perhaps even a tidied-up Caracas, may have a place in Chavez's
revolution. Pedro Aponte, 72, a retired fruit seller, relied on
nostalgia to discuss the boulevard's potential.
</P>
<P>
"We have to conserve this place," said Aponte he set up chess
sets a recent morning under an awning, where a growing crowd
gathers each day to play. Officials even organized a small
Carnival celebration on Sabana Grande this year, though it paled
in comparison with Carnivals of decades past in Aponte's opinion.
</P>
<P>
"We would throw something called smile powder on the girls,"
Aponte reminisced.
</P>
<P>
"They would smile," he said. "That was beautiful."
