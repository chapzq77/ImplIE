Senior US official to visit Syria for talks on Iraq refugees
</HEADLINE>

<P>
A senior US official will visit Syria in the coming weeks to
discuss the problem of Iraqi refugees, the State Department said
Thursday in a new sign of a possible thaw between Washington and
Damascus.
</P>
<P>
Assistant Secretary of State Ellen Sauerbrey will travel to
Damascus along with an official of the UN refugee agency as part
of a regional tour dealing with "humanitarian issues related to
Iraqi refugees in those countries," said department spokesman
Sean McCormack.
</P>
<P>
Sauerbrey and the UN High Commmisioner for Refugees (UNHCR)
representative will also visit Jordan and possibly other states
"in coming weeks," he said.
</P>
<P>
The United States withdrew its ambassador from Damascus after
Syria was implicated in the February 2005 assassination in Beirut
of former Lebanese prime minister Rafiq Hariri.
</P>
<P>
The administration of President George W. Bush has since refused
high-level contacts with Syria, which it accuses of backing anti-
US insurgents in neighboring Iraq and efforts by the Lebanese
Islamic movement Hezbollah to topple the Western-backed
government of Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
But in a sudden policy shift, US Secretary of State Condoleezza
Rice announced this week that she and other US officials would
join their Syrian and Iranian counterparts at conferences on
Iraq's future in the coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
McCormack has refused to rule out bilateral contacts with Syrian
and Iranian officials on the sidelines of those meetings, but
insisted these could only deal with Iraq-related issues and not
the myriad other disputes between Washington and the two states.
