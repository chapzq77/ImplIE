SOME HOPE REPORT FINDING HPV IN MORE THAN 25% OF WOMEN DIFFUSES
TENSION OVER CONTROVERSIAL CANCER VACCINE

<P>
More than a quarter of U.S. women are infected with a sexually
transmitted virus that sometimes can cause cervical cancer,
health researchers say.
</P>
<P>
The study, conducted by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention, provides the most comprehensive assessment of human
papillomavirus prevalence among American women. The overall
prevalence was slightly higher than previous estimates.
</P>
<P>
"We expected to find that this was a highly prevalent infection,"
said Dr. Eileen Dunne, a staff epidemiologist with CDC and chief
author of the new study, published in Wednesday's Journal of the
American Medical Association.
</P>
<P>
The new report, based upon a national analysis of nearly 2,000
women, was released amid a heated debate in Texas over whether 11
-year-old girls should be required to receive a vaccine that
protects women from the virus.
</P>
<P>
According to the study, just 3.4 percent of women were infected
with the four types of HPV -- which cause 70 percent of cervical
cancers and most cases of genital warts and other health problems
-- covered by the vaccine.
</P>
<P>
That still means about 3 million U.S. women could benefit from a
vaccine, said Dr. Maurie Markman, vice president for clinical
research at the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center
in Houston.
</P>
<P>
"From the perspective of cancer prevention, this seems like a
clear-cut case in favor of the vaccine," he said.
</P>
<P>
The vaccine, recently recommended by federal health authorities
for females ages 9 to 26, has become as much a political issue as
a scientific one in Texas.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Gov. Rick Perry issued an executive order
that made Texas the first state to mandate the vaccine for
younger girls. Perry said his goal was to protect future
generations from cervical cancer, which afflicts more than 10,000
women a year in this country.
</P>
<P>
Perry has been rebuked by social conservatives, who say his
promotion of the vaccine condones pre-marital sex, as well as
legislators who say he exceeded his constitutional powers by
issuing the executive order.
</P>
<P>
The Texas Medical Association, too, has said the vaccine
shouldn't be mandated, citing, in part, the high cost of the
three-shot regimen, which starts at $360.
</P>
<P>
Last week, a bill passed a state House committee that would
revoke Perry's order and make it illegal to mandate the Merck-
manufactured HPV vaccine for girls.
</P>
<P>
Some scientists say they hope the new study can diffuse some of
the tension surrounding the vaccine issue in Texas.
</P>
<P>
"... It's a shame that we can't focus on educating people about
the benefits of this vaccine instead of just getting embroiled in
the political intrigue," said Dr. Lawrence Stanberry, chairman of
the department of pediatrics at the University of Texas Medical
Branch at Galveston.
</P>
<P>
Stanberry said the significance of the new study for Texas is
that the data on prevalence of HPV in the United States is
similar to the estimates made in cost-effectiveness studies of
the vaccine, suggesting that earlier research is valid.
</P>
<P>
The earlier studies indicated that widespread use of the vaccine
would save money because initial investments in the cost of the
vaccine would be more than recouped by a reduction in cancer
treatment expenses and eventually might increase the recommended
interval between Pap smears, Stanberry said.
