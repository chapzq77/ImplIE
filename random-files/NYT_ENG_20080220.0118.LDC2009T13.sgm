HAIR-RAISING THRILLER PLAYS TO ' VANTAGE POINT ' S '  ADVANTAGE

It's high noon in Salamanca, Spain. The president of the United
States is arriving in a large city plaza to deliver the keynote
speech in the kick-off of a groundbreaking international anti-
terror summit attended by 150 world leaders.
</P>
<P>
A teeming throng crowds the plaza: waves fly, cameras roll. The
mayor of Salamanca delivers a welcome as U.S. secret service
agents nervously scan the crowd. The president approaches the
podium, raising both arms in salutation and triumph. Then: crack,
a gunshot. Crack, another gunshot. The president goes down, and a
bearded man in a white shirt bolts across the stage.
</P>
<P>
A small boom, followed by mayhem. Then a monstrous boom, followed
by more mayhem, as a bomb explodes inside the plaza. The smoke
clears to reveal a horrific expanse of blood and broken bodies,
and it's clear that hundreds -- maybe thousands -- have died.
Ambulance sirens and wails of agony pierce the aftermath.

Now ask yourself: Doesn't that sound like a fun time at the
multiplex? Before you collapse from post-9/11-depressing-movie
fatigue (and by the way, you really should see "In the Valley of
Elah"), consider the tingles of excitement to be found in a nice,
straightforward, good old-fashioned geopolitical conspiracy
thriller with no pretentions. "Vantage Point" is nothing but a
potboiler, but there is room in this world for potboilers --
especially intelligent and well-structured potboilers that grab
us by the hair and send us flying. This is a very crafty film
with a very kick-butt car chase. And sometimes, that's all we
need from the cinema: a concentrated dose of adrenaline.

In the hands of lauded British TV director Pete Travis, ("Henry
VIII") and screenwriter Barry Levy, "Vantage Point" functions as
a Euro-centric 21st-century "Rashomon," minus swords. Every few
scenes or so, the movie "rewinds" 21 minutes to that same,
fateful noon and retells the events from a new perspective. In
this manner it cranks through multiform points of view:
television journalists covering the summit (Sigourney Weaver and
Zoe Saldana); the secret service men assigned to the president
(Dennis Quaid and Matthew Fox); the mysterious white-shirted
running man (Eduardo Noriega); the tourist who films the whole
thing (Forest Whitaker); the president himself (William Hurt);
and assorted terrorists.

This could get tedious fast. It doesn't -- thanks to the film's
airtight (or close to it) logic and attention-deficit pacing,
which means that any existing plot holes whoosh past too fast to
notice. I did not feel encouraged to think while watching this
movie. I did, however, feel encouraged to gasp in amazement
whenever cinematographer Amir Mokri hyper-zoomed on someone's
eyeballs (they're staring; I get it) and gasp in shock at the
plot twists, some of which were stupidly and unnecessarily blown
in the trailer. Ninety percent of the movie is utterly effective,
though I will admit to laughing for all the wrong reasons at
Matthew Fox's character arc. Good actor meets ill-fitting role.
</P>
<P>
The rest of the cast acquits itself just fine in a film that
doesn't allow much room for actorly flourishes. Hurt is vacantly
presidential and Whitaker is splendidly warm, while Quaid harks
back to Clint Eastwood's bone-weary presidential bodyguard from
"In the Line of Fire." Everyone utters every line as though the
fate of the world depended on it. "We have to be better than
this," says a politico near the end, and he says it with all due
solemnity. But I have to disagree: they don't have to be any
better than this. Neither does the movie. For what it is, it's
more than good enough.
