Bush Pitches Health-Care Plan in Tennessee
</HEADLINE>

CHATTANOOGA, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
President Bush traveled here Wednesday seeking support for his
health-care proposals, taking a turn at the controls of a
surgical robot at a Chattanooga hospital and praising Tennessee's
effort to expand health-care coverage to the uninsured.
</P>
<P>
At an event at this city's convention center that was billed as a
round-table on his initiatives, Bush traded one-liners with a
handful of workers who have had trouble getting health insurance
and employers who have had difficulties providing it.
</P>
<P>
One of them was interior designer Amy Childers, whose employer
does not offer health coverage. She said she had purchased
private insurance, but dropped it last summer when she turned 35.
</P>
<P>
At that Bush interjected: ``You don't look a day over 34.''
</P>
<P>
``Most people say 22, but thanks,'' Childress responded amid
laughter from the audience. She went on to say that she had
dropped coverage because the cost went from $130 a month to $210.
</P>
<P>
``Doesn't it make sense to change the tax code so that Amy
Childers can better afford insurance?'' Bush asked.
</P>
<P>
The president has proposed making medical insurance premiums
deductible for all Americans, up to $15,000 for a family and
$7,500 for individuals. Currently, employers can deduct health-
care premiums without limit, but individual taxpayers cannot.
</P>
<P>
Bush and his staff argue that the current system unfairly
penalizes consumers who must purchase individual policies, such
as the self-employed or those working for small businesses. They
also say it creates an incentive for employers and employees to
choose more expensive health care than they need, helping drive
prices higher.
</P>
<P>
The president's proposals have gotten a frosty reception on
Capitol Hill. Democrats, who took control of both chambers of
Congress last month, agree that health insurance should become
more affordable for the self-employed. But they say that the
biggest problem is the 47 million people in the United States
with no health insurance, and that the president's proposal would
help only a small fraction of them.
</P>
<P>
In particular, they point out that the premium deduction would
not help taxpayers who do not itemize deductions on their income
tax returns. Instead, they favor a tax credit for premiums, which
they say would help all taxpayers regardless of their filing
status.
</P>
<P>
``While the president's focus on health care is important, his
proposals will only worsen the crisis by undermining the quality
coverage that millions of working families now rely on, and
replacing it with a tax break that will benefit the wealthiest
Americans,'' Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., chairman of the
Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, said
Wednesday in a statement.
