US Congress to hold first major debate on Iraq war since 2002
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The US Congress on Tuesday holds its first major debate on the
Iraq war since it authorized President George W. Bush to invade
the country in 2002.
</P>
<P>
Opposition Democrats in the House of Representatives are to
debate a symbolic measure introduced Monday that calls for
supporting US troops and criticizes the president's decision to
send 21,500 extra US troops Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Legislators with Bush's Republican party blocked a similar, more
complicated measure in the Senate last week on procedural
grounds.
</P>
<P>
Democrats won control of Congress in November elections thanks to
voter anger over the nearly four-year-old war, in which more than
3,100 American soldiers have died. About 138,000 US soldiers are
currently in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Democratic House majority leader Steny Hoyer is the first
legislator scheduled to speak.
</P>
<P>
"We believe the American public want a straightforward answer to
the question: Do you agree with the president's proposal?" Hoyer
told NBC television on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The last major debate in Congress on Iraq was in October 2002,
when a bipartisan majority in both chambers authorized Bush to
use military force if Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein failed to
comply with United Nations resolutions on disarmament and let in
weapons inspectors.
</P>
<P>
Some legislators who are now prominent war critics, including
Senators Hillary Clinton and John Kerry, expressed misgivings but
still voted for the authorization.
</P>
<P>
The non-binding House measure says in less than 100 words that
"Congress disapproves" of Bush's so-called troop surge, and
expresses continued support for the military -- an apparent
attempt to avoid appearing unpatriotic and lure undecided
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
The White House indicated that Bush would not be swayed by any
resolution against his Iraq policy, and warned that such a
measure would send the wrong message to US troops and America's
enemies.
</P>
<P>
Republicans last week blocked a 1,600-word bipartisan Senate
resolution opposing the new Iraq policy, the first major setback
for majority Democrats.
</P>
<P>
The breakdown in the narrowly-divided Senate is 51 Democrats to
49 Republicans, meaning bills require a greater degree of
bipartisan support to pass.
</P>
<P>
Democrats hold a more comfortable 233 to 202 majority over
Republicans in the 435-member House.
</P>
<P>
The president announced the troop increase on January 10, six
days after Democrats took control of Congress.
</P>
<P>
A sizeable majority of Americans now oppose the war and less than
half have voiced confidence in Bush's new plan to deploy more
troops in an effort to restore security to Baghdad amid
escalating sectarian violence.
</P>
<P>
House leaders have allowed each member five minutes to comment on
the measure. A vote is expected by Friday.
</P>
<P>
"We don't believe that that policy will work," Hoyer said in his
NBC interview. "The overwhelming sentiment of the military is it
won't work, and certainly the American people do not believe
it'll work."
</P>
<P>
The House Republican minority leader, John Boehner, said he
opposed the resolution but feared that some Republicans would
vote for it.
