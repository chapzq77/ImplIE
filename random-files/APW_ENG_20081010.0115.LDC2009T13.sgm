<P>
On the eve of a report on a legislative panel's abuse-of-power
investigation into Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, Republican campaign
officials released their own report clearing her of any
wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
Palin, running mate to Republican presidential nominee John
McCain, is the subject of two inquiries into whether she abused
her power by firing her public safety commissioner. The
commissioner says he was dismissed for resisting pressure to fire
Palin's former brother-in-law, a state police officer.
</P>
<P>
Lawmakers in one of the inquiries are expected to release their
findings Friday.
</P>
<P>
The report the McCain-Palin campaign released Thursday night says
the firing was based on a budget dispute. Since then, the report
says, the matter has been muddled with innuendo, rumor and
politics.
