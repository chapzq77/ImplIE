Authorities say he used an e-mail alias, Ed Guitterrez, to
communicate with at least two teenage boys.
</P>
<P>
He gave one alcohol. He convinced them to let him take nude
photos of them, and for them to take nude photos of themselves.
</P>
<P>
And when they agreed, he mailed them payments, sometimes hidden
inside computer disc cases so parents would not be suspicious. He
offered at least one of the boys $200 in exchange for oral sex.
</P>
<P>
He told them the photos would be sold in Germany.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Al Zimmerman, 40, a former spokesman for the
Department of Children and Families, was arrested on a federal
child pornography production charge at his parents' home in
Lakeland, his second arrest in about a week. He's being held in
the Hillsborough County Jail.
</P>
<P>
The federal criminal complaint reveals more details about how
authorities think Zimmerman victimized at least two teenagers
and possibly more  over several months' time.
</P>
<P>
Zimmerman paid two teenage boys money to pose nude and masturbate
for photographs between 2006 and 2007, authorities say.
</P>
<P>
They say he took some of the photos on a Canon camera; others
were sent to Zimmerman by the teens on his cell phone. Zimmerman
met one of the boys, a foster child, through his job.
</P>
<P>
At a first appearance hearing in the Tampa federal courthouse
Monday, assistant U.S. Attorney Colleen Murphy-Davis argued that
Zimmerman should not be released on bail, calling him a community
danger.
</P>
<P>
She said Zimmerman was so obsessed with talking to underage boys
that he used his work computer to constantly ask them to send him
pornography that he could sell.
</P>
<P>
In one message dated June 29, 2007, authorities say he wrote one
of the teens: "If you can get a hold of a camera that you can use
regularly whether it's a cell phone cam or regular digital, I
could sell a few pics here and there every month and make you 100
to 200 a month in cash, or 50-80 depending on if they're just
shirtless or naked."
</P>
<P>
But Zimmerman's attorney, Brian Albritton of Tampa, asked Judge
Mark A. Pizzo to delay a bond hearing. He said he wanted
Zimmerman's parents to be present so they can testify that their
son won't skip bail if he's granted a release. His parents have
already put up their house as collateral for $120,000 bail after
he was released from the Hillsborough County Jail on Feb. 2, he
said. He returned to the jail Monday.
</P>
<P>
Zimmerman, formerly of Tallahassee, had been living with his
parents in his hometown of Lakeland until he was picked up Monday
on the federal charge.
</P>
<P>
The judge agreed with Zimmerman's attorney and scheduled the bond
hearing for 1:30 p.m. today. Federal marshals took custody of
Zimmerman in the meantime, leading him out of the courtroom
Monday evening in leg shackles.
</P>
<P>
Monday's charges are the newest in the case against Zimmerman, a
friendly and respected press secretary whose Feb. 1 arrest on
eight state child pornography shocked DCF officials, reporters
who worked with him and longtime friends.
</P>
<P>
Zimmerman, a former television journalist who earned $75,000 as a
DCF spokesman, previously worked as a reporter at Bay News 9,
KENS-TV in San Antonio and WMAZ-TV in Macon, Ga.
</P>
<P>
DCF spokeswoman Erin Geraghty described Zimmerman's actions as "a
betrayal of trust" and said the agency would continue to
cooperate with the investigation.
</P>
<P>
If convicted of the federal charge, Zimmerman could get a
mandatory minimum prison sentence of 15 years. He could get up to
120 years if convicted of the eight state charges. The federal
case will be prosecuted before the state case, Murphy-Davis said.
</P>
<P>
Zimmerman has worked with the DCF since 2005, first as spokesman
for the department's District 13, which includes Citrus and
Hernando counties, and then as a spokesman in Tallahassee for the
entire state agency.
</P>
<P>
When authorities recently arrived at Zimmerman's Tallahassee home
with a search warrant, they found a DCF computer technician,
Michael Hernandez, in his driveway, the complaint states.
</P>
<P>
Hernandez told investigators that he had thrown Zimmerman's home
computer in a Dumpster at Zimmerman's request. Hernandez also
told them two days earlier he had "wiped" and reformatted
Zimmerman's laptop computer at his co-worker's request.
</P>
<P>
The complaint says Zimmerman admitted he was "involved in a
pornography business." He told investigators the first victim
showed him identification stating he was 18 years old, but
Zimmerman said he suspected the card was a fake. The complaint
says he also told investigators he knew the second victim, who
was in foster care and was a runaway at one time, was 17 years
old.
