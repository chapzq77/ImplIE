Presidential Hopefuls Raising Funds Early and Often
</HEADLINE>

WASHINGTON
</P>
<P>
Presidential candidates are collecting contributions at a record-
setting pace and are racing to load their schedules with
fundraising events ahead of March 31, the campaign's first
deadline for filing financial reports.
</P>
<P>
The amounts that contenders can bring in will shape the narrative
of the race for months to come -- potentially vaulting a
candidate into the top tier -- and could spell an early exit for
some.
</P>
<P>
Fundraising professionals say they expect the candidates to
greatly exceed totals from previous cycles, perhaps by hundreds
of millions of dollars. Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton, D-N.Y., for
example, mingled with about a thousand donors Tuesday night at
the Marriott Wardman Park Hotel for her campaign's second
million-dollar-plus fundraiser in three days.
</P>
<P>
It is not simply Clinton's outsize fundraising power driving the
vacuum-cleaner mentality. A confluence of other factors --
including voter dissatisfaction with the Bush administration,
wide-open fields in both parties, higher donation caps and a rush
by large states such as California and Texas to move their
primaries to the front of the nominating process -- has compelled
campaigns to establish virtually round-the-clock fundraising
schedules, with candidates and surrogates participating in
sometimes a dozen events or more in a day. Not a single day in
March will pass without at least one 2008 contender personally
making a major push for funds.
</P>
<P>
The result: More than a year and a half before the election, the
collective field could match in a single quarter the nearly $100
million that George W. Bush raised during his record-breaking
primary effort two presidential cycles ago.
</P>
<P>
``It's almost a geometric increase,'' said Michael Toner, who
left his post as a member of the Federal Election Commission last
week.
</P>
<P>
Campaigns are also aggressively trying to manage expectations,
providing low-ball estimates of what they will raise while
exaggerating predictions for their opponents. Estimates of what
Clinton will raise this quarter range from $15 million (the
official prediction of the campaign, but one her own aides
privately concede is low) to $50 million (a staggering and
probably unrealistic figure).
</P>
<P>
Sen. Barack Obama, D-Ill., has similarly played down his goals,
with aides saying they would be thrilled with a take of $7
million to $12 million this quarter. But there is ample evidence
-- such as Obama's raising $1.3 million at a single Hollywood
event -- to suggest that he could do better, perhaps hitting $20
million or higher.
</P>
<P>
One of the great unknowns is how former senator John Edwards,
D-N.C., will fare. Clinton and Obama (as well as Republicans John
McCain of Arizona and Sam Brownback of Kansas) must pay at least
some attention to their positions in the Senate, but Edwards is
unencumbered by a day job and is still riding his popularity as
the vice presidential nominee in 2004. He has by all accounts
been on a furious, if quiet, fundraising tear, hoping to at least
match the $7.4 million he raised in the first quarter of 2003 --
a number that at the time led all contenders and vaulted him into
serious contention.
</P>
<P>
For Edwards and other Democrats seeking to catch up with Clinton
and Obama -- such as Sen. Christopher Dodd of Connecticut, Sen.
Joe Biden of Delaware and New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson -- the
money flow, or lack thereof, could produce a moment of reckoning.
</P>
<P>
``It's a contest of elimination,'' said Fred Baron, Edwards'
national finance chair. ``If a candidate can't raise the money,
it bodes poorly for that candidate and might cause them to
rethink their candidacy.''
</P>
<P>
Alan Solomont, chairman of Obama's fundraising effort in New
England, described the campaign's fundraising venture as a
``start-up'' that has required building from the ground up in a
short time. Obama is holding low-dollar ``kickoff'' fundraisers
in cities nationwide, including a $100-per-ticket fundraiser in
Denver and a $25-per-ticket event in Oklahoma City in recent
days, and a $100-per-ticket event in West Palm Beach this
weekend.
</P>
<P>
At a recent breakfast in Cambridge, Mass., Obama spoke to about
two dozen young venture capitalists -- many of them political
novices -- in an effort to tap new pools of money rather than
engage in a zero-sum game with Clinton. His supporters say the
strategy is working.
</P>
<P>
``I had thought, `Boy, this is going to be quite an effort,' not
knowing how to raise money or who to even turn to, and within a
couple weeks' time we had more than quadrupled my expectations in
terms of what we would raise,'' said Dan Nova, 45, a first-time
presidential fundraiser who held the breakfast event at his
house. Nova declined to give the exact figure brought in but
described it as a ``significant, multi-hundred-thousand dollar
amount'' -- far in excess of the $50,000 he set out to raise.
</P>
<P>
Obama's rivals argue that his ability to hold multimillion-dollar
events in New York and Los Angeles belie the campaign's claim
that his is simply a grass-roots movement without major financial
players. He has stolen away dozens of Clinton fundraisers; hired
a veteran finance director, Julianna Smoot; and signed up a
talented team of Web designers at the company Blue State Digital
to help power his online fundraising effort. In the last election
cycle, Blue State Digital helped former Vermont governor Howard
Dean bring in a flood of low-dollar online donations that
catapulted him into the spotlight.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, who can roll over more than $11 million from her Senate
race last year, has a huge, traditional network in place --
headed by the veteran Clinton finance guru, Terence McAuliffe --
and her husband, perhaps the party's biggest fundraising draw. On
Sunday, Bill Clinton hosted a 1,000-person gala at the Sheraton
in New York; he also attended Tuesday night's event (minimum
donation: $1,000) at the Marriott Wardman Park. In between, the
former president was scheduled to attend a fundraising reception,
at the home of Sheila and Jay Kaplowitz in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
``Just as she is exceeding expectations everywhere she is going
politically, we'd all like to exceed expectations when it comes
to fundraising,'' said Steve Grossman, a major Clinton fundraiser
in Boston. He said Hillary Clinton, like Obama, is bringing in
new donors every day.
</P>
<P>
After an intimate ``friend-raising'' dinner at the home of Elaine
and Gerry Schuster in Boston in February, Clinton supporters are
preparing for a much larger gathering on March 30 -- just under
the wire for first-quarter filing. The campaign has asked donors
to send checks in advance so they can be applied to the March 31
tally.
</P>
<P>
Both Clinton and Obama are expected to hold fundraisers in Las
Vegas later this week.
</P>
<P>
In a significant change, strategists on both sides of the aisle
agree, Democratic contenders could wind up with more money than
their Republican counterparts.
</P>
<P>
Still, GOP benchmarks exist. The campaigns of former New York
mayor Rudolph Giuliani and former Massachusetts governor Mitt
Romney have said publicly that they hope to collect $75 million
to $100 million by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
Early on, Romney impressed insiders by collecting more than $6
million in a single call-athon day in Boston, but one strategist
said he has not heard much since from the former governor.
``Either he's gotten all the money he's going to get or they've
got so much money they don't need any more,'' the strategist
said. Romney is staying active on the fundraising circuit, with
20 events scheduled this month.
</P>
<P>
Kevin Madden, a spokesman for Romney, refused to offer a concrete
goal for the quarter, adding: ``Everybody recognizes that
fundraising totals should be reflective of the national polls. In
the national polls, we are in third place.''
</P>
<P>
Giuliani may have the most to gain -- or lose -- with his first-
quarter showing, and he and his inner circle of fundraisers are
acting like it. One Republican operative said that Paul Singer, a
pioneer in hedge-fund investing and a Giuliani backer, is
personally making calls to potential donors in New York and
Washington, putting his own capital on the line to round up cash.
</P>
<P>
Allies of McCain have argued that he got a late start on raising
money. McCain had been unofficially running for months, if not
years, before that announcement. His first major event was on
March 2 in Phoenix, and was the first in a series of ``Exchange
of Ideas'' fundraisers in which the crowd is allowed to question
the candidate. A week later, a second ``Exchange'' fundraiser was
staged in New York, where a featured speaker was former secretary
of state Henry Kissinger.
</P>
<P>
Bush, an incumbent running without significant primary
opposition, raised $36 million in the first six months of 2003.
His campaign began fundraising in earnest only in early March.
