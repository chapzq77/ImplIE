Pope calls for Middle East peace accord in New Year's homily
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pope Benedict XVI called Monday for a peace accord in the Middle
East, embroiled in a "conflict that has persisted for too long,"
during his New Year's Day mass at Saint Peter's Basilica.
</P>
<P>
Marking World Peace Day, he referred to "the scene of the
shepherds of Bethlehem visiting Jesus in the manger," asking:
"How can you not look again at the dire situation that
characterizes this land where Jesus was born?"
</P>
<P>
The 79-year-old pontiff asked: "How can you not implore with
insistent prayer that the day of peace arrives as soon as
possible to this region, the day when the conflict that has
persisted for too long will be resolved?
</P>
<P>
"A peace accord, to be durable, must rest on respect for dignity
and the rights of each person," he urged the Vatican diplomatic
corps attending the mass.
</P>
<P>
"In the face of the threats to peace that are unfortunately ever-
present, in the face of situations of injustice and violence that
persist in many parts of the world, before continuing armed
conflicts often forgotten by much of public opinion, and the
danger of terrorism that disturbs peoples' serenity, it becomes
more than ever necessary to work together for peace," he said.
</P>
<P>
On December 12 Benedict sent a message to the world's 1.1 billion
Catholics ahead of World Peace Day in which he condemned what he
called the transformation of religion "into an ideology," and
said that "a war in the name of God is never acceptable."
</P>
<P>
The wide-ranging message also condemned violations of religious
freedoms, inequality of the sexes, "disrespectful" attitudes
towards the environment, religion transformed into "ideology",
terrorism, human rights abuses and the spread of nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
"The way to ensure a future of peace for everyone is found not
only in international accords for the non-proliferation of
nuclear weapons, but also in the determined commitment to seek
their reduction and definitive dismantling," the pope said.
