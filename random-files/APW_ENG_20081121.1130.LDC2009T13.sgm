Human rights council may meet on Congo violations

The president of the U.N.'s Human Rights Council said Friday
members could meet next week to look at the rampant shootings,
rape and looting among 1 million civilians uprooted by fighting
in eastern Congo.
</P>
<P>
Worried about the Congolese caught between soldiers and rebels,
Martin Ihoeghian Uhomoibhi, who also serves as Nigeria's
ambassador to Switzerland, plans to convene the 47-nation Geneva-
based council if at least a third of its members request the
session.
</P>
<P>
Uhomoibhi told The Associated Press there's "evidence of a strong
will in civil society that (council) actions should be taken to
address a very serious situation." Most of the council's African
and European members are discussing the possibility, he said, and
more than 50 non-governmental organizations have urged such a
session.
</P>
<P>
Two rights groups, Freedom House and U.N. Watch, wrote to top
U.N. officials this week asking that the Human Rights Council
urgently spotlight the Congo's "mass displacement, killings and
sexual violence -- involving hundreds of thousands of victims, if
not more."
</P>
<P>
They asked that the council reinstate a human rights monitor for
Congo who was eliminated earlier this year in a bow to Congo's
government.
</P>
<P>
Uhomoibhi said more than 1 million have been displaced by the
fighting. More than 250,000 refugees have been forced from homes
in eastern Congo in recent weeks between the army and fighters
loyal to rebel leader Laurent Nkunda.
</P>
<P>
Nkunda says he is protecting Tutsis from Hutus who fled to Congo
after Rwanda's 1994 genocide, but critics say he is making a
power grab and accuse his forces of committing multiple human
rights abuses. Congo's army and other militias also are accused
of abuses.
</P>
<P>
The council was created in March 2006 to replace the U.N.
Commission on Human Rights, often criticized as easily
manipulated by nations with poor human rights records. The U.S.
was one of the few nations that voted against creating the
council, arguing that it also lacked safeguards against
hypocrisy.
</P>
<P>
The council, whose purpose is to address human rights violations,
lacks any binding authority.
