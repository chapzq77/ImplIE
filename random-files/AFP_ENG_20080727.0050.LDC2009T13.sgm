African cotton producers see no progress in US subsidy talks
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
African cotton producers seeking a cut in US subsidies for US
cotton producers voiced frustration Sunday as they claimed
Washington offered "nothing concrete" during global trade talks
underway here.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot say that we are satisfied. There is nothing concrete,"
an African negotiator told AFP.
</P>
<P>
The so-called C4 group of West African cotton producers -- Benin,
Burkina Faso, Chad and Mali -- met US Trade Representative Susan
Schwab to discuss domestic cotton subsidies within the overall
framework of mammoth talks to secure a new global free trade
pact.
</P>
<P>
The C4 group has since 2003 been fighting for the cotton issue to
be included in the Doha Round of World Trade Organisation
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The group wants industrialised countries, particularly the United
States, to lower domestic subsidies that the African nations say
weigh down world cotton prices and penalise poorer countries.
</P>
<P>
They were assured that the issue would be treated "ambitiously,
expeditiously and specifically" by WTO trade partners in 2004.
</P>
<P>
But the African negotiator said Sunday that there had been "no
advances" in the talks with Schwab.
</P>
<P>
"The US promised they would do more on cotton than on the rest of
agriculture, but they don't want to announce anything right now,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
"There weren't even any signals at this stage on what figures
they might propose," he added.
</P>
<P>
The group wants to see subsidies cut by 82.2 percent in the US, a
figure included in a negotiating text that is forming the basis
of discussions on a new free-trade pact.
</P>
<P>
Schwab's spokeswoman Gretchen Hamel told AFP that the two sides
"discussed creating opportunities for African farmers to export
through lowering tariffs and barriers imposed on cotton."
</P>
<P>
But the African diplomat said market access was not the issue,
stating: "What we want is for them to relieve us of the burden of
(their) subsidies."
