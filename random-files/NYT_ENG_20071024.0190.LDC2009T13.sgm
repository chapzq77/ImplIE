MIDEAST HAWKS HELP TO DEVELOP GIULIANI POLICY
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rudolph W. Giuliani's approach to foreign policy shares with
other Republican presidential candidates an aggressive posture
toward terrorism, a commitment to strengthening the military and
disdain for the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
But in developing his views, Giuliani is consulting with, among
others, a particularly hawkish group of advisers and
neoconservative thinkers.
</P>
<P>
Their positions have been criticized by Democrats as
irresponsible and applauded by some conservatives as
appropriately tough, while raising questions about how closely
aligned Giuliani's thinking is with theirs.
</P>
<P>
Giuliani's team includes Norman Podhoretz, a prominent
neoconservative who advocates bombing Iran "as soon as it is
logistically possible"; Daniel Pipes, the director of the Middle
East Forum, who has called for profiling Muslims at airports and
scrutinizing American Muslims in law enforcement, the military
and the diplomatic corps; and Michael Rubin, a scholar at the
American Enterprise Institute who has written in favor of
revoking the U.S. ban on assassination. The campaign says that
the foreign policy team, which also includes scholars and experts
with different policy approaches, is meant to give Giuliani a
variety of perspectives.
</P>
<P>
Based on his public statements, Giuliani does not share all of
their views and parts company with traditional neoconservative
thinking in some respects. But their presence has reassured some
conservatives who have expressed doubts about Giuliani's
positions on issues like abortion and gun control, and
underscored his efforts to cast himself as a tough-minded
potential commander in chief.
</P>
<P>
And while Giuliani, like other New York mayors, liked to be seen
as conducting his own brand of foreign policy from City Hall, he
had little direct exposure to many of the specific issues the
next president will confront and is still meeting for the first
time with some of his advisers to develop detailed positions on
particular subjects.
</P>
<P>
Giuliani has taken an aggressive position on Iran's efforts to
build a nuclear program, saying last month it was a "promise"
that as president he would take military action to keep the
Iranians from developing a nuclear weapon.
</P>
<P>
Warnings like that one and his reliance on advisers like
Podhoretz, who wrote an article in June for Commentary magazine
called "The Case for Bombing Iran," have raised concerns among
some Democrats. Podhoretz said in an interview published
Wednesday in the New York Observer that he recently met with
Giuliani to discuss his new book, in which he advocates bombing
Iran as part of a larger struggle against "Islamofascism," and
"there is very little difference in how he sees the war and I see
it."
</P>
<P>
Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr. of Delaware, a Democratic candidate for
president and chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee,
said recently that the specter of a Giuliani presidency
frightened him.
</P>
<P>
"I mean, here's a guy making statements about Iran that, if he
means them, guarantee there is no option but a war," Biden said
in a recent interview.
</P>
<P>
Asked in a recent interview if he agreed with Podhoretz that the
time to bomb Iran has already come, Giuliani said: "From the
information I do have available, which is all public source
material, I would say that that is not correct, we are not at
that stage at this point. Can we get to that stage? Yes. And is
that stage closer than some of the Democrats believe? I believe
it is."
</P>
<P>
Like the neoconservatives, who played a major role in developing
the Bush administration's rationale for invading Iraq, Giuliani
is a strong supporter of Israel who has expressed skepticism
about how far the United States should go to back the creation of
a Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
But Giuliani has distanced himself somewhat from what was once a
central neoconservative tenet, the belief that the United States
could spread democracy through the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Giuliani rejects the democracy effort as premature and overly
idealistic, noting that the policy led to the sweeping victory of
Hamas in the Palestinian elections.
</P>
<P>
"Elections are necessary but not sufficient to establish genuine
democracy," Giuliani wrote in an article in Foreign Affairs, the
policy journal. "Aspiring dictators sometimes win elections, and
elected leaders sometimes govern badly and threaten their
neighbors."
</P>
<P>
Neoconservatives said they were generally supportive of
Giuliani's positions and saw them as being in line with those
taken by the other leading Republican presidential candidates.
</P>
<P>
"I would say, as a card-carrying member of the neoconservative
conspiracy, that I think Giuliani, McCain and Thompson are all
getting really good advice -- and Romney," said William Kristol,
editor of The Weekly Standard.
</P>
<P>
Kristol said that none of the leading Republican candidates "buy
any of these fundamental criticisms that Bush took us on a
radically wrong path, and we have to go to a pre-9/11 foreign
policy."
</P>
<P>
The emerging Giuliani doctrine, which is being created through
conference calls, policy papers, and seminar-like meetings,
contains a number of main elements.
</P>
<P>
Giuliani calls for continuing the war in Iraq and building up the
military by adding at least 10 new combat brigades to the Army.
He takes a dim view of the United Nations, which he sees as good
for little other than humanitarian and peacekeeping missions, but
wants to expand NATO and invite Israel to join it.
</P>
<P>
He would continue the Bush administration's efforts to fight AIDS
and malaria in Africa, but would tailor policy toward Africa to
emphasize trade over aid.
</P>
<P>
If there is a central tenet to his thinking, it may be that the
United States must project strength to keep itself safe.
"Weakness invites attack," Giuliani warned to cheers in a speech
he gave recently to the Republican Jewish Coalition.
</P>
<P>
On the question of diplomacy, Giuliani makes it clear that he
would impose a number of conditions before opening talks with
unfriendly countries. In the Foreign Affairs article, he wrote
that it might be advisable at times to hold serious diplomatic
talks with the nation's adversaries, but not with "those bent on
our destruction or those who cannot deliver on their agreements."
</P>
<P>
In a recent speech to the Jewish Coalition, he went further,
accusing the Democrats of putting too much stock in diplomacy.
"This is the great fallacy in this now very strong Democratic
desire to negotiate, negotiate, negotiate and negotiate," he
said. "You've got to know with whom to negotiate and with whom
you should not negotiate."
</P>
<P>
The foreign policy education of Giuliani, from former big-city
mayor to would-be statesman, has played out in a series of
briefings and papers and calls.
</P>
<P>
Aides to Giuliani dismiss any comparison to the briefings Bush
received when he was the governor of Texas, and a procession of
experts -- who called themselves Vulcans, after the Greek god of
the forge -- visited him in Austin to school him on policy.
Giuliani, these aides said, already had a broad vision of what he
wanted to do.
</P>
<P>
One of Giuliani's most important foreign policy tutors is Charles
Hill, a career diplomat and former deputy to Secretary of State
George P. Shultz in the Reagan administration. Hill had never met
Giuliani when he was summoned to a 45-minute meeting at the
office of Giuliani Partners in late February -- a meeting that
stretched to nearly three hours.
</P>
<P>
Hill went on to become the campaign's chief foreign policy
adviser, and to assemble a team that is united by its generally
hawkish views and its belief in using American power to achieve
its aims.
</P>
<P>
Just days after the Sept. 11 attacks, Hill joined a number of
prominent foreign policy experts in signing an open letter to
Bush urging that "even if evidence does not link Iraq directly to
the attack, any strategy aiming at the eradication of terrorism
and its sponsors must include a determined effort to remove
Saddam Hussein from power in Iraq."
</P>
<P>
Instead of talking about "the war on terror," Giuilani speaks of
"the terrorists' war on us," or, as he put it in a recent speech
to a group of conservative Christians, the "Islamic terrorists'
war against the United States." He sometimes faults Democrats for
failing to mention that the terrorist threat comes specifically
from Muslims.
</P>
<P>
When Giuliani was asked in a recent interview if he could be
viewed as an evenhanded broker when it came to Israeli-
Palestinian issues, he questioned the premise of the question.
</P>
<P>
"America shouldn't be even-handed in dealing with the difference
between an elected democracy that's a government ruled by law,
and a group of terrorists," he said. "I think that was part of
the mistake of the 1990s that led to the debacle that we saw in
the Middle East in the way Clinton was handling it."
