Top investigator says up to 6 Nigerian ex-governors to be charged

ABUJA, Nigeria 2007-10-23 15:55:59 UTC

<P>
Nigeria's top corruption investigator said Tuesday that up to six
ex-governors will be charged by the end of the year, a major
development in a country where having high-level connections has
long offered a shield from prosecution.
</P>
<P>
Nuhu Ribadu, chairman of Nigeria's Economic and Financial Crimes
Commission, refused to identify the men, saying he is afraid
"they will run." But, he said, up to six will face charges in the
next two months.
</P>
<P>
"Definitely more governors will be charged," Ribadu told The
Associated Press in an interview at his office in the Nigerian
capital. "Governors are so afraid, wherever they go now."
</P>
<P>
The governors of Nigeria's 36 states lose their immunity from
prosecution when their terms end. Many have been suspected of
raiding public coffers -- and leaving their constituents
impoverished -- while they hide their ill-gotten gains outside
the country.
</P>
<P>
Under Nigeria's federal system, states receive much of the
government's funds and are charged with providing schools, health
clinics and other basic services to their people. State budgets
can reach beyond US$1 billion per year, particularly in the
southern oil region, where budgets are even higher and graft
particularly rife.
</P>
<P>
Since President Umaru Yar'Adua took power in May, the EFCC has
begun prosecuting five former governors and has won the
conviction of one who had been previously charged.
</P>
<P>
The crackdown is a signal to many in Nigeria that Yar'Adua is
trying to make good on his pledge to stamp out graft in a country
that is considered one of the most corrupt in the world.
</P>
<P>
"For us to win this war (against corruption), we have to start at
the top and trickle down," said Ribadu, a former police officer
and prosecutor who boasts that he sent more people to jail than
anyone else in Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
"Elites are the ones who destroy the rule of law," he added.
</P>
<P>
Ribadu's agency was set up in 2004 as part of an anti-corruption
drive by then-President Olusegun Obasanjo.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria is Africa's largest oil exporter and the fifth-largest
supplier of crude to the United States. But despite producing
tens of billions of dollars' (euros') worth of crude every year,
few Nigerians have access to clean water or electricity.
</P>
<P>
Ribadu said he senses an increased intolerance for corruption in
Nigeria, pointing to the public outcry over the case of the
speaker of the House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
Patricia Etteh, a former beautician and ruling party member, is
accused of irregularities in spending US$5 million of government
money to renovate two official residences and buy 12 cars.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Nigerian members of Parliament traded blows
-- and one of them later died of a heart attack -- during a
debate over the allegations.
</P>
<P>
Etteh has denied wrongdoing, but at a previous appearance before
the National Assembly she was greeted with chants of "Thief!
Thief!"
</P>
<P>
"There is a silent revolution triggered by this fight against
corruption," Ribadu said.
