Hormone Treatment Could Aid HIV Treatment
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The hormone produced good results but would have to be used very
carefully to avoid inducing diabetes, said Dr. Steven Grinspoon
of the Harvard Medical School, lead author of the paper.
</P>
<P>
He presented the results, which will be published this week in
the Journal of the American Medical Association, at the
International AIDS Conference in Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
About 40 percent of males and 16 percent of females who take
cocktails of anti-AIDS drugs for their HIV infections develop fat
deposits in the stomach, neck and cheeks. Called visceral fat, it
is associated with higher levels of cholesterol and triglycerides
and increases the risk of heart attacks and stroke.
</P>
<P>
Such patients typically have abnormally low levels of growth
hormone and researchers had hoped that replacing it with
genetically engineered human growth hormone -- the same drug used
to treat below normal growth rates and can be abused by athletes
-- might reverse the effects.
</P>
<P>
But previous studies using higher levels of the hormone produced
unacceptable side effects, including tissue swelling and pain in
the joints.
</P>
<P>
Grinspoon and his colleagues studied 56 HIV-positive patients who
had deposits of fat in their stomachs and low blood levels of the
hormone. Half were given daily doses of about 0.33 milligrams of
the hormone, well below the 2 to 4 milligrams used in previous
studies. Half the subjects were given a placebo.
</P>
<P>
Over the 18 months of the study, stomach fat dropped by 8.5
percent in the patients receiving the hormone, compared to 1.6
percent in those receiving a placebo. The team did not study
cardiovascular risk.
</P>
<P>
Tests showed some elevation of blood sugar in patients receiving
the hormone, particularly those who had abnormal glucose
tolerance tests at the beginning of the trial. Grinspoon said
that future clinical trials should include a diabetes drug, such
as metformin, to minimize side effects.
</P>
<P>
Another study in the special AIDS-themed issue of JAMA found that
rifampicin, a drug commonly used to treat tuberculosis, can
interfere with treatment for AIDS. The finding was important
because about one-third of the HIV-positive people in the world
also have TB.

<P>
Dr. Andrew Boulle and his colleagues at the University of Cape
Town in South Africa studied nearly 4,000 people who began HIV
treatment between 2001 and 2006. About half received the most
commonly used AIDS drug, nevirapine, And the rest received
efavirenz, both of them so-called non-nucleoside reverse
transcriptase inhibitors.
</P>
<P>
About 10 percent of people in the nevirapine group also had TB,
and about half of those in the efavirenz group.
</P>
<P>
At the end of six months, 16.3 percent of those who received
nevirapine when they were already taking rifampicin for TB had
treatment failure marked by high levels of HIV in their blood,
compared to 8.3 percent of those who did not have TB.
</P>
<P>
Rifampicin did not interfere with the efavirenz treatment,
however, Boulle told the meeting. It also did not interfere with
nevirapine if the patients contracted TB while they were taking
the AIDS drug. The researchers do not know why the drug
interferes with HIV treatment.

A third study looked at HIV treatment of injection drug abusers.
Some researchers have claimed that treatment provides little
benefit in this group because they are not sufficiently motivated
to take their AIDS drugs regularly.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Julio Montaner of the University of British Columbia and his
colleagues treated 3,116 patients at Canadian clinics, including
915 who were drug abusers.
</P>
<P>
After an average of five years of treatment, he reported, 26
percent of the drug users had died from all causes, compared to
22 percent of the other AIDS patients -- a difference that was
not statistically significant.
</P>
<P>
Montaner noted that the drug users who were prescribed AIDS drugs
were just as likely to use them as those whose infections arose
from other sources. But he cautioned that the injection drug
users are less likely to receive a prescription in the first
place, so that their overall death rate will remain higher.
