ALGIERS, Algeria 2007-09-08 11:56:22 UTC

A booby-trapped car exploded at a barracks housing coast guard
officials in Algeria on Saturday, killing at least 17 people and
injuring about 30, the country's official news agency reported,
citing hospital authorities.
</P>
<P>
The explosion -- the North African nation's second terror attack
in less than 48 hours -- ripped through the northern coastal town
of Dellys, about 50 kilometers (30 miles) from Algiers,
shattering many of the town's windows. In the confusion, security
authorities initially gave a lower death toll before the APS
agency released an official count by hospitals. Some of those
injured were in serious condition.
</P>
<P>
A recent spate of major bombings in Algeria has generated fears
of a return to the mass-scale violence of the 1990s, when
Algeria's Islamic insurgency peaked. The country, a staunch U.S.
ally in the war against terror, has been trying to turn the page
on the 15-year insurgency that killed 200,000 people. Until
recently, its efforts appeared mostly successful.
</P>
<P>
The attack came just two days after another bombing killed at
least 22 in a crowd of people in eastern Algeria who were waiting
to see visiting President Abdelaziz Bouteflika, who has devoted
his eight years in office to ending the insurgency.
</P>
<P>
There was widespread speculation that Bouteflika was the intended
target of that attack, though Algerian officials kept silent on
the question. Police said the bomber was killed by security
services after he dropped the explosives and tried to escape.
</P>
<P>
There was no immediate claim of responsibility in either attack.
However, an al-Qaida affiliate calling itself al-Qaida in Islamic
North Africa has been active in Algeria lately. On Friday,
Interior Minister Noureddine Yazid Zerhouni warned terrorists
that they have "one choice: turn themselves in, or die."
</P>
<P>
Algeria's insurgency broke out in 1992, after the army canceled
legislative elections that a now-banned Islamic fundamentalist
party was poised to win.
</P>
<P>
Widespread killing was on the wane until recently, but violence
resurfaced this year after Algeria's Salafist Group for Call and
Combat, or GSPC, officially linked with al-Qaida, taking the name
al-Qaida in Islamic North Africa.
</P>
<P>
The group claimed responsibility for other attacks this year,
including an April suicide bombing outside the prime minister's
office in Algiers and a simultaneous attack on a police station
that killed 32 people.
</P>
<P>
Al-Qaida's Algerian branch also said it was responsible for
another attack in July, when a suicide bomber blew up a
refrigerated truck inside a military encampment southeast of the
Algerian capital, killing 10 soldiers.
