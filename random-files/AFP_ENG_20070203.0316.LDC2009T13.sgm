Football: Eto'o on the fast track and in Barca squad
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Three-time African Player of the Year Samuel Eto'o was a surprise
inclusion in the Barcelona squad named on Saturday that will face
Osasuna on Saunday.
</P>
<P>
The Cameroon striker and the Spanish first division's leading
scorer last season only returned to full training with the La
Liga leaders on Thursday after being out of action for four
months.
</P>
<P>
Eto'o tore the meniscus in his right knee against Werder Bremen
in the Champions League last September and his return had been
provisionally pencilled in for next week, when the European
champions play host to Racing Santander.
</P>
<P>
"Samuel's return is good news for us. I have included him for
team morale and to play," Barca coach Frank Rijkaard said a press
conference on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"He won't complete a full match but he's been cleared by the
doctors and is fit to play a few minutes, half an hour or more,"
added the Dutchman.
</P>
<P>
"Eto'o transmits strength to the team. He's a player that
supports us a lot both on and off the pitch," added Barca's
Spanish international Andres Iniesta.
</P>
<P>
Barca's 2004 and 2005 World Player of the Year Ronaldinho will be
missing from the game against Osasuna after struggling to recover
from bruises to his right knee and ankle sustained in their 1-0
Spanish Cup defeat by Real Zaragoza on Wednesday.
