World Cup: Vincent goes to hospital with suspected broken wrist

New Zealand opener Lou Vincent was taken to hospital Sunday with
a suspected broken wrist after a Shane Bond delivery hit him on
the left arm during a net session.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand spokesman John Durning confirmed the accident
occurred during the team's first training session since
relocating from St. Lucia on Friday, where it had won its opening
three group games.
</P>
<P>
Vincent hit 101 in New Zealand's 114-run win against Canada on
Thursday after failing to score in the Black Caps' opening two
matches. He has also been sharp in the field, with three run outs
from direct hits.
</P>
<P>
With a hamstring strain expected to sideline No. 3 Ross Taylor
for New Zealand's opening Super 8s game against the West Indies,
the New Zealand batting lineup is severely weakened.
</P>
<P>
Peter Fulton could be promoted to join opener Stephen Fleming,
with the specialists all move up a spot as New Zealand has no
reserve batsmen in its squad.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand has already had to call for Chris Martin to replace
injured bowler Daryl Tuffey (right biceps), and if Vincent is
also ruled out, New Zealand is likely to chose from Hamish
Marshall or Michael Papps.
</P>
<P>
The 28-year-old Marshall has played 63 ODIs, the last against
Australia on Jan. 21. Papps, 27, has only six limited overs
appearances and he last played an ODI in February 2005.
