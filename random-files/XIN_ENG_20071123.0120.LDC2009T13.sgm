Lebanon's presidential election deadline imminent amid doubts

BEIRUT, Nov. 23 (Xinhua)
</P>
<P>
The deadline for Lebanese parliament to elect a new president is
imminent on Friday, while uncertainty and doubt are running high
as rival pro- and anti- Syrian politicians are still at odds on a
compromise presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
The parliament is scheduled to convene at 1:00 p.m. (1100 GMT) to
pick a successor to replace pro-Syrian President Emile Lahoud
whose term ends at midnight.
</P>
<P>
The anti-Syrian ruling majority and pro-Syrian opposition have
not strike a deal on a compromise candidate despite intensive
international mediation, drawing speculations that Friday's
session, which has been delayed for four times since September,
might be postponed again.
</P>
<P>
Early in the morning, a crowd of journalists assembled outside
the parliament building, waiting for parliamentarians to show up
for the planned session.
</P>
<P>
In downtown Beirut, usually bustling streets are quiet as the
area where the parliament building is located was declared off-
limits.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, vigilant soldiers, police and guards are heavily
deployed along the street, with more armed vehicles and tanks at
major intersections.
</P>
<P>
Under Lebanon's constitution, if no president is elected by the
parliament in time limit, presidential powers pass to the
government.
</P>
<P>
But Lahoud has reiterated that he will not hand over the power to
the government led by Prime Minister Fouad Seniora, which he
considered as "illegitimate."
</P>
<P>
According to the country's power-sharing system, Lebanon's
president must be a Maronite Christian and is elected by
parliament rather than by popular votes.
</P>
<P>
A two-thirds majority is required for a candidate to be elected
by parliament in a first round of voting. In the event of a
second round, a simple majority suffices.
</P>
<P>
The ruling coalition led by Saad Hariri enjoyed a slim majority
in the 128-seat parliament by 68 seats against the opposition's
59. However, the assassinations targeting the lawmakers from the
pro- government political bloc further dwindled the slight
dominance.
</P>
<P>
Many fear that failure in reaching a deal on the presidential
candidate could result in a power vacuum in the country or a
split with two rival governments standing against one another.
