GUANTANAMO, Cuba 2007-01-11 02:25:39 UTC
</P>
<P>
Peace activists screened a film for Guantanamo city residents
about a former prisoner at the U.S. military base in nearby
Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, on the eve of their Thursday protest to
demand the prison be closed five years after terror suspects
first arrived.
</P>
<P>
"It will be our big day," Medea Benjamin, who organized the
protest through the California groups Global Exchange and
Codepink.
</P>
<P>
American "peace mom" Cindy Sheehan; the former prisoner portrayed
in the film British Muslim Asif Iqbal; and the mother of a man
still held at the remote U.S. military prison will also be among
a dozen protesters.
</P>
<P>
Benjamin said the late morning event on the Cuban side of the
American base would include a kilometer-long march to the main
gate, and the reading of the names of the nearly 400 men held
inside.
</P>
<P>
"We should be able to shut down the U.S. prison," Benjamin said
before the screening of the movie "The Road to Guantanamo,"
prompting a standing ovation by several hundred Cubans at the
event. "Let's dream about closing down the base completely."
</P>
<P>
Residents of Guantanamo largely resent the presence of the U.S.
base, which their government considers a violation of the
communist-run nation's sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. military still holds about 395 men on suspicion of links
to al-Qaida or the Taliban, including about 85 who have been
cleared to be released or transferred to other countries. The
military says it wants to charge 60 to 80 detainees and bring
them to trial.
</P>
<P>
The protest outside the base will coincide with others in cities
around the world to demand the United States close the prison on
the fifth anniversary of the arrival of the first prisoners.
</P>
<P>
Zohra Zewawi, the mother of detainee British citizen Omar Dehayes
traveled from the United Arab Emirates to join the protest. She
was accompanied by another son, Taher Deghayes.
</P>
<P>
Zewawi says her son had been tortured and blinded in one eye
since he was imprisoned in September 2002. He still has not been
charged or tried.
</P>
<P>
Sheehan, of Vacaville, California, became an anti-war activist
after her 24-year-old son Casey was killed in Iraq. She drew
international attention and was dubbed the "peace mom" after she
camped outside of U.S. President George W. Bush's Texas ranch.
</P>
<P>
The protesters arrived in Guantanamo from Havana on Tuesday night
and on Wednesday held a daylong international conference that
featured members of their group and Cubans from Guantanamo, many
of them high school and university teachers.
</P>
<P>
"They feel a lot of pain because their city is known for the
prison," Benjamin said of the Cuban teachers.
</P>
<P>
During the conference, peace delegation member Adele Welty, who
lost her firefighter son in the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks,
expressed empathy with Zewawi and other mothers of men held at
Guantanamo prison.
</P>
<P>
Welty said that in the case of her son Timothy, "I have been
assured that it was over quickly, that he did not feel the tons
of concrete that tore his body apart.
</P>
<P>
"But for five years, (the inmates') mothers have lived with the
images of them being torn apart from torture," Welty said.
