Naples area rubbish crisis deepens
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The rubbish crisis in the Naples area deepened Thursday as two
treatment centres complained of paralysis and local authorities
announced the upcoming closure of a major dump, an official said.
</P>
<P>
Outside the Caivano treatment centre some 20 kilometres (12
miles) from the southern city, about 100 trucks were seen waiting
to unload their rubbish.
</P>
<P>
Another centre that converts rubbish into fuel, located at nearby
Giugliano, "is also functioning at a snail's pace", Ilaria
Proietti told AFP.
</P>
<P>
She added that one of the area's two main dumps, in Villaricca
north of Naples, would close on Saturday because it had reached
saturation point.
</P>
<P>
The two-week-old crisis has seen some 15,000 tonnes of waste
accumulate along roads in the southern province, including nearly
3,000 tonnes in Naples itself, because of a logjam at
overstretched treatment and recycling centres, Proietti said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The crisis poses a "serious health risk," said Proietti, the
spokeswoman for an extraordinary commission assigned to the
longstanding regional problem.
</P>
<P>
New figures were not available Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Provincial authorities have sent text messages to Naples area
residents asking them not to burn their waste in a bid to avoid
the spread of toxic substances such as dioxin.
</P>
<P>
The chronic problem is the result of a lack of space in existing
dumps, some of which have been closed by court injunctions after
their operations were taken over by organised crime, dubbed the
"ecomafia".
</P>
<P>
A May 10 decree by the centre-left government creating four new
dumps -- fiercely opposed by people living nearby -- will not
come into effect for several weeks.
