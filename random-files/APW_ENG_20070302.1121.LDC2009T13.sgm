Moroccan King Mohammed VI pardoned nearly 9,000 prisoners to
celebrate the birth of his baby girl, the Justice Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the 8,836 pardons, the king also reduced the
sentences of 24,218 other prisoners, the ministry said in a
statement released to the official MAP news agency Thursday.

<P>
The North African kingdom's massive pardon came after Princess
Lalla Salma gave birth to a baby girl Wednesday. Lalla Khadija is
the royal couple's second child. Crown Prince Moulay Hassan was
born in May 2003.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said the pardons were based on humanitarian concerns
and a hope of integrating many prisoners back into society. Those
pardoned include people with disabilities, pregnant women and the
elderly.
