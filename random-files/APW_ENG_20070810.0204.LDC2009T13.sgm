falls 300

NEW YORK 2007-08-10 02:11:37 UTC
</P>
<P>
Wall Street's deepening fears about a spreading credit crunch
sent stocks plunging again, with the Dow Jones industrials
extending their series of triple-digit swings and falling more
than 380 points. The catalyst for the market's latest skid: a
French bank's announcement that it was freezing three funds that
invested in U.S. subprime mortgages.
</P>
<P>
The announcement by BNP Paribas raised the specter of a widening
impact of U.S. credit market problems Thursday. The idea that
anyone -- institutions, investors, companies, individuals --
cannot get money when they need it unnerved a stock market that
has suffered through weeks of volatility triggered by concerns
about tight credit and bad subprime mortgages.
</P>
<P>
A move by the European Central Bank to provide more cash to money
markets intensified Wall Street's angst. Although the bank's loan
of more than $130 billion (euro94.69 billion) in overnight funds
to banks at a low rate of 4 percent was intended to calm
investors, Wall Street saw it as confirmation of the credit
markets' problems. It was the ECB's biggest injection ever.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve added a larger-than-normal $24 billion
(euro17.48 billion) in temporary reserves to the U.S. banking
system.
</P>
<P>
The concerns that arose in Europe and spilled onto Wall Street
underscored the potential worldwide ramifications of an implosion
of some subprime loans and perhaps also weakened arguments that
strength in the global economy could help keep profit growth
going in the U.S. among large companies that do business
overseas.
</P>
<P>
The ECB's injection of money into the system is an unprecedented
move, said Joseph V. Battipaglia, chief investment officer at
Ryan Beck &amp; Co., adding that it shows that problems in
subprime lending are, in fact, spreading into the general
economy.
</P>
<P>
"This is a mini-panic," he said. "All the things that had been
denied up until this point are unraveling. On top of this, retail
sales were mediocre, which shows that indeed, the housing
collapse is affecting the consumer."
</P>
<P>
Retailers released July sales figures Thursday that were overall
disappointing.
</P>
<P>
The Fed did not soften its stance on inflation after leaving
short-term interest rates unchanged Tuesday. However, the renewed
credit market concerns spurred bond traders who bet on its next
move to predict that the Fed will cut rates at its meeting next
month. Before Thursday, traders had bet on a 1 in 4 chance of
such a cut.
</P>
<P>
The Dow fell 387.18, or 2.83 percent, to 13,270.68.
</P>
<P>
Thursday's pullback continued an erratic pattern of triple-digit
moves in the Dow since the index closed at a record 14,000.41 on
July 19. Eleven of the 15 ensuing sessions have ended in a
triple-digit gain or loss. Gains have been evaporating at the
first mention of trouble in housing, subprime lending or the
credit markets.
</P>
<P>
With Thursday's decline, the Dow is about 730 points, or 5.2
percent, below its record close. Some experts have been calling
for a textbook correction -- a pullback of at least 10 percent.
At its lowest close since the market's high, Friday's finish of
13,181.91, the Dow was 5.85 percent below the record.
</P>
<P>
Bonds rose sharply Thursday as investors again sought the
relative safety of Treasurys, pushing down the yield on the
benchmark 10-year note to 4.79 percent from 4.89 percent late
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The broader Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index fell 44.40, or 2.96
percent, to 1,453.09.
</P>
<P>
Before Thursday, the S&amp;P had its best three-day winning
streak in nearly five years. But the latest pullback was the
biggest point drop and percentage loss for both the Dow and the
S&amp;P since a market decline on Feb. 27., that owed in part to
concerns about subprime loans.
</P>
<P>
The Nasdaq composite index fell 56.49, or 2.16 percent, to
2,556.49. On Wednesday, it posted its biggest point gain in more
than year. And while Thursday's loss was sharp, last Friday's was
more severe.
</P>
<P>
Despite Thursday's slide, the major market indexes are still up
for the week, given that stocks rose sharply the first three
sessions of the week.
</P>
<P>
The pullback came after a BNP Paribas unit said it was suspending
three funds together worth about $3.79 billion (euro2.76 billion)
and wouldn't make investor redemptions until it could determine
net asset values.
</P>
<P>
The funds invest in part in subprime mortgages through a process
known as securitization. Investment banks bundle together
mortgages -- including those from subprime borrowers -- and sell
them off to investors such as hedge funds, mutual funds and other
institutional investors. Buyers of such securities are seeking
the steady flow of income from homeowners making their mortgage
payments.
</P>
<P>
"It just kind of brought the fear back," said Douglas Peta,
market strategist at J.&amp; W. Seligman in New York.
</P>
<P>
"In the last couple of days I think people maybe thought that an
all-clear had been sounded," he said referring to some of the
subprime loan concerns.
</P>
<P>
"This just highlights that there is not going to be an immediate
resolution," he said of the companies that are trying to
determine their exposure to bad subprime loans.
</P>
<P>
Shares of financial companies, which investors have fled recently
amid lending concerns, took another beating Thursday. Citigroup
Inc. fell 5 percent, as did fellow Dow component JPMorgan Chase
&amp; Co.
</P>
<P>
The dollar was mixed against other major currencies, while gold
prices fell. Light, sweet crude fell 56 cents to $71.59
(euro52.15) per barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advancers by about 4 to 1 on the New
York Stock Exchange, where consolidated volume came to a heavy
5.76 billion shares compared with 5.3 billion shares traded
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 10.79, or 1.36
percent, to 784.87.
</P>
<P>
The Chicago Board Options Exchange's volatility index, often
called the "fear index," rose Thursday to its highest level since
April 2003.
</P>
<P>
European stocks plunged. Britain's FTSE 100 lost 1.92 percent,
Germany's DAX index fell 2.00 percent, and France's CAC-40 fell
2.17 percent after being down more than 3 percent. Japan's Nikkei
stock average rose 0.83 percent. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index fell
0.43 percent.
