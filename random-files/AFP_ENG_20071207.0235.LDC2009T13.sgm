IMF set to cut up to 15 percent of staff in overhaul
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The International Monetary Fund announced plans Friday to cut up
to 15 percent of its staff in a wide-ranging overhaul aimed at
shoring up finances at the multilateral economic institution.
</P>
<P>
In comments posted in an internal IMF magazine, the organization
said the planned overhaul aimed at budget savings of around 100
million dollars annually and possible job losses of between 300
and 400 staff.
</P>
<P>
Such cuts could affect around 15 percent of the IMF's total
headcount of 2,600.
</P>
<P>
An IMF official, who requested anonymity, told AFP the job cuts
would likely occur over three years starting on May 1, 2008.
</P>
<P>
The jobs losses, if implemented, would rank among the largest in
the IMF's history. Prior job cuts have been small by comparison
involving considerably less than 100 employees.
</P>
<P>
Dominique Strauss-Kahn, a former French finance minister who took
over the helm of the IMF in early November, said the fund does
not face an immediate financing crisis, but that it cannot
continue to rely on income from lending to guarantee its future.
</P>
<P>
Strauss-Kahn said the overhaul is key to refocusing the IMF's
operations and his bid to introduce a new and stronger income
model for the 185-country institution.
</P>
<P>
Without quickly reforming its operations and cutting jobs, the
IMF could face a funding shortfall of 400 million dollars by
2010, the magazine article, which was posted on the IMF's
website, warned.
</P>
<P>
The Standard &amp; Poor's credit rating agency said in a recent
report that the IMF is burning up its cash reserves so fast it
risks hindering its ability to help countries in need.
</P>
<P>
The Washington-based IMF, seen as a lender of last resort to
impoverished and developing countries, lost about 110 million
dollars in its fiscal year ended April 30, but the S&amp;P
cautioned that such losses could double if it does not address
its operations.
</P>
<P>
An internal IMF group advising the organization has recommended
that the fund sell some of its valuable gold reserves and invest
the proceeds in income- generating assets in a bid to improve its
financial stance.
</P>
<P>
The overhaul comes as the IMF faces challenges over its survival.
Many developing nations are growing rapidly and as a result have
less need for IMF aid which is often granted with strict
standards.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Wall Street Journal published Friday,
the straight- talking Kahn said: "This institution works well,
with dedicated people and very high-level staff, but it is a
factory to produce paper."
</P>
<P>
In the IMF magazine, the IMF chief was quoted as saying "the
coming months will inevitably be a period of rapid change."
