at auction

<P>
If owning a chunk of the Berlin Wall is not enough for die-hard
fans of communist-era collectables, bids are now being taken for
three grandiose murals from the former East German parliament.
</P>
<P>
Up for grabs are a brown-and-blue mosaic of two lovers from a
wall of the former espresso bar inside the parliament, a flowery
blue-and-white mosaic that decorated the ice cream parlor, and a
gold-plated, tile-mural that used to adorn the palace's
restaurant.
</P>
<P>
The mosaics are both 33.5 square meters (361 square feet), while
the tiled mural measures 17.5 square meters (188 square feet).
All three pieces were made in 1975-76 by the well-known Meissen
porcelain manufacturer and were specially ordered by the East
German parliament.
</P>
<P>
While most of the parliament's artwork was donated to museums
after the German unification of 1990, Germany's agency that deals
with unresolved property issues decided to sell the murals. On
Friday, it posted pictures on its Web site and began accepting
sealed bids starting at euro10,000 (US$13,600) each. The mosaics
have already been removed tile by tile from their original
location.
</P>
<P>
Several potential buyers had contacted the agency by Friday
afternoon, a spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
"We're hoping that the murals will end up on the wall of a
restaurant or a museum's cafe so that they will be visible for
the public again," Ellen Haendler said. "It seems like there's
quite a bit of interest, from German as well as international
bidders."
</P>
<P>
At the time the murals were installed, the agency said, the
espresso bar mosaic was worth euro18,540 (US$25,207), the ice
cream parlor's wall decoration was euro28,788 (US$39,140) and the
restaurant mural was worth euro8,063 (US$10,962).
</P>
<P>
Written bids have to be delivered to the agency by May 25.
</P>
<P>
After years of debate about the future of the iconic Palace of
the Republic, the parliament building has been stripped down to
its steel and concrete skeleton and will be razed by the end of
2008. The original bronze-glass-fronted parliament building in
downtown Berlin included public restaurants, theaters and even a
bowling alley.
</P>
<P>
To restore the area, the government, the city and private
fundraisers plan to rebuild a version of a Prussian royal palace,
which used to stand on the site, with space for museums and a
luxury hotel.
</P>
<P>
Damaged during World War II, that Prussian palace was dynamited
in 1950 by the East German government in a move that some in the
West viewed as more ideological than practical.
