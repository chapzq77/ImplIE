over whaling crackdown

Using the military to track Japanese whalers as part of
Australia's anti-whaling campaign could cause a diplomatic rift
with Tokyo, the opposition warned Friday.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Kevin Rudd told reporters Thursday that he will
detail next week how his government intends to gather evidence of
illegal conduct by Japanese whalers in the Southern Ocean in the
coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
A week before his Labor Party won elections on Nov. 24, a senior
colleague Robert McClelland promised military resources would be
used to monitor the Japanese fleet.
</P>
<P>
Rudd on Thursday would not rule out using warships and air force
planes to take pictures that could bolster Australia's case in an
international court against Japanese whaling in the Australia-
declared whale sanctuary in the Southern Ocean.
</P>
<P>
"We would not rule out the use of Australian assets to collect
appropriate data, including photographic evidence concerning
whaling activities," Rudd said.
</P>
<P>
Labor in opposition had promised a tougher stance against the
annual Japanese slaughter of hundreds of whales in the southern
sanctuary, which Japan does not recognize.
</P>
<P>
Opposition leader Brendan Nelson, who was defense minister before
the election, questioned whether such a military deployment would
harm relations with Japan, Australia's second most important
trading partner after China.
</P>
<P>
"I would be very concerned about sending war assets -- warships
and air force planes -- down to look at the Japanese whaling
fleet in terms of how is that going to escalate the diplomatic
tensions between Australia and Japan," Nelson told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Japan is allowed by the International Whaling Commission to
harpoon whales for scientific research and to sell the carcasses
commercially.
</P>
<P>
Labor argues that Australia could take action against the whalers
in the International Court of Justice in The Hague or the
International Tribunal of the Law of the Sea in Hamburg to add to
international pressure against whaling.
</P>
<P>
Japanese Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Minister Masatoshi
Wakabayashi, whose responsibilities include whaling, told
Australian Broadcasting Corp. radio through an interpreter that
Japan "will not tolerate any moves to obstruct our research
whaling program."
