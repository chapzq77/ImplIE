French probe of Picasso theft will take time
</HEADLINE>

<P>
French investigators on Thursday held out little hope of quickly
recovering two paintings by Pablo Picasso stolen from the Paris
apartment of the artist's granddaughter.
</P>
<P>
The paintings by the Spanish master worth a total of 50 million
euros (66 million dollars) were taken from the flat of Diana
Widmaier Picasso as she was sleeping, and without a break-in, in
the night of Monday to Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"It will be a long and difficult investigation," said a source
close to the case.
</P>
<P>
Investigators were not ruling out any motive for the crime,
saying it may have been the work of thieves acting at the behest
of an art collector or small-time robbers wanting to get their
hands on some valuable loot.
</P>
<P>
The thieves made off with a 1961 portrait of Picasso's second
wife Jacqueline Roque and "Maya with Doll," a painting of
Picasso's daughter done in 1938.  A drawing was also taken.
</P>
<P>
A detailed description of the artworks was sent out to all police
in France and in neighbouring countries through Interpol, said
Bernard Darties, the deputy director of the office overseeing
trafficking in cultural goods.
</P>
<P>
Art dealers and gallery owners have also been notified of the
theft, he said.
</P>
<P>
Darties said that 80 percent of cases involving thefts of major
artworks, the perpetrators are "thieves who saw an opportunity",
believing that they will cash in on the stolen works "but find
themselves unable to sell them."
</P>
<P>
Many stolen paintings by Picasso have been recovered over the
years after police notified the art market of the theft.
</P>
<P>
The risk however is that the perpetrators may decide to destroy
the paintings if they find themselves unable to sell them, said
Darties.
</P>
<P>
The paintings were on display in the apartment located in the
chic Left Bank area of Paris, but security precautions had been
taken to protect the works, according to Paul Lombard, a lawyer
representing the Picasso family.
</P>
<P>
"Maya With Doll" is one of Picasso's classic oil paintings done
in bright shades of green, blue and red and depicting young Maya
in pigtails holding a doll and a small wooden horse.
</P>
<P>
Maya was Widmaier Picasso's mother, born to Marie-Therese Walter,
who was one of Picasso's many female companions.
</P>
<P>
Picasso's 1905 masterpiece "Boy with a Pipe" remains the most
expensive painting ever sold since it went under the hammer at a
New York auction for 104.2 million dollars in May 2004.
</P>
<P>
Picasso died on April 8, 1973 at his home in the southern French
town of Mougins. He was 91.
