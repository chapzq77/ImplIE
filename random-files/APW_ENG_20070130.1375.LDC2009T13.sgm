Eiffel Tower to switch off lights as scientists finish major
report on global warming

The Eiffel Tower's 20,000 flashing light bulbs will go dark for
five minutes on Thursday evening, hours before scientists and
officials publish a long-awaited report about global warming.
</P>
<P>
The blackout comes at the urging of environmental activists
seeking to call attention to energy waste -- and just hours
before world scientists unveil a major report on Friday warning
that the planet will keep getting warmer and presenting new
evidence of humanity's role in climate change.
</P>
<P>
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change will release a
report laying out policy proposals for governments based on the
latest research on global warming.
</P>
<P>
The top U.N. official for the environment asked Secretary-General
Ban Ki-moon on Tuesday to convene an emergency summit of world
leaders aimed at breaking a deadlock over cutting greenhouse
gases.
</P>
<P>
The impetus for such a world summit is U.S. President George W.
Bush's acknowledgment in his Jan. 24 State of the Union speech
that climate change needs to be dealt with, and the EU's Jan. 10
proposals for a new European energy policy that stresses the need
to slash carbon emissions blamed for global warming, U.N.
environment program spokesman Nick Nuttall said.
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot of momentum that has being building," Nuttall
said. "We have a window of opportunity."
</P>
<P>
Nuttall said the summit could be held between July and December.
</P>
<P>
The second day of the Paris talks wound down Tuesday evening more
or less on schedule, according to officials at UNESCO, the
conference's host.
</P>
<P>
There was little sign of the late-night wrangling among countries
that marked previous reports. The report must be unanimously
approved by bureaucrats from more than 100 governments who can
challenge the scientists' wording.
</P>
<P>
"The government people determine how things are said, but we (the
scientists) determine what is said," said Kevin Trenberth, a lead
author of the report and director of climate analysis at the U.S.
National Center for Atmospheric Research in Colorado.
</P>
<P>
The end result is a cautious document, many scientists say.
</P>
<P>
One Russian participant said Tuesday that the discussions he
observed were more procedural than political.
</P>
<P>
Another observer who has taken part in several such conferences,
Stephanie Tunmore of Greenpeace, said, "So far we're running on
timetable. But who knows, we've got two more days. If there's any
panic, it will be Wednesday night when they realize they've only
got a few hours left."
</P>
<P>
An early draft of the report being released in Paris suggests it
will contain stronger evidence of the human role in climate
change and more specific predictions of rising temperatures and
sea levels this century.
</P>
<P>
The report "won't change our scientific basis, but it will make
our jobs easier," Steve Sawyer, of Greenpeace, said Tuesday. "It
is an important and powerful new tool in public debate and policy
debate."
</P>
<P>
Environmental groups have long urged governments and consumers to
rely more on renewable energy sources such as solar and wind
power instead of greenhouse gas-emitting ones like coal and oil.
Greenhouse gases are considered a key culprit of rising global
temperatures.
