Macedonia jails pair over huge cocaine haul
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Macedonian court sentenced two people to 14 and a half years in
prison each on Friday after finding them guilty of trafficking
almost half a tonne of cocaine.
</P>
<P>
"The defendants are guilty of the trafficking, production and
illicit trade of drugs," Court of Skopje judge Vesna Dimiskovska
said as she read out the verdict.
</P>
<P>
A woman, Stanislava Cocorovska-Poletan, had been found to have
unlawfully organised the drug's transportation, while Alija
Azirovic was the driver of the truck in which the huge stash was
found in January.
</P>
<P>
Lawyers acting for the pair said they would appeal the decision.
</P>
<P>
Police seized the cocaine from a truck owned by Cocorovska-
Poletan's company after it had entered Macedonia from the
neighbouring Serbian province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The value of the drug haul, the biggest intercepted by Macedonian
authorities yet and believed to have come from Venezuela, was
estimated at about 40 million euros (54 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
According to the indictment, it had come via Italy, Montenegro
and Kosovo and was intended for the Greek market. The Balkan
region is a major trafficking route towards the European Union.
