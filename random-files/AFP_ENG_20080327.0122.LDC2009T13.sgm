Two US government employees have been killed and four others
seriously wounded in a wave of rocket attacks this week against
the heavily fortified Green Zone in Baghdad, officials said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
One US government employee was killed in the latest attack on
Thursday and another died Monday after having been hurt seriously
during a rocket strike on Sunday, State Department officials
said.
</P>
<P>
"One US government employee, a US citizen, was killed in the
latest round of indirect fire into the International (Green)
Zone," according to a statement from Julie Reside, a State
Department spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
Contacted by AFP, Reside confirmed that "two (US government
employees) have died as a result" of the attacks inside the Green
Zone since Sunday.
</P>
<P>
There were no details on the identity of the latest victim
pending notification of his or her family, she said.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman Sean McCormack said earlier that he
believed that the American who died on Monday -- who was one of
five US government employees who were seriously wounded -- was
under contract to the US Army.
</P>
<P>
McCormack said "extremist criminal elements" on Sunday, Tuesday,
Wednesday, and again on Thursday fired rockets into the zone that
serves as the seat of the Iraqi government and the US embassy.
