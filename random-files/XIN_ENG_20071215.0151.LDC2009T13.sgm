<P>
World number one Wang Hao dashed the last hope of none-Chinese
players, ousting Vladimir Samsonov of Belarus here on Saturday to
make the men's singles semifinals of the ITTF ProTour Finals all-
Chinese encounters.

<P>
"It's a really tough game for me. I had my chance at the
beginning, but Wang played better. It's natural he win the
match," said the 31-year-old Samsonov.
</P>
<P>
"Both of us have good performance," said Wang, who won an Olympic
final rematch against Ryu Seung Min of South Korea to make the
quarters. "Samsonov and Ryu are among the top players in the
world and it's a good opportunity for me to face them here and
beat them."
</P>
<P>
Samsonov, who has never claimed a world championship but won
three European top honors and two World Cups, saw a possible
turning point in the third set as he earned three set point on
10-7 and denied Wang's late comeback to win it 15-13.

<P>
The former leading one in Europe's "Good Time", however, has been
ousted from the main group of world top class table tennis,
succumbed to the world number one Chinese 11-9, 11-5, 13-15,
11-9, 11-7.
</P>
<P>
"I lost my distraction when leading 10-4 in the fourth set, but I
tried to put myself together and turned back to the winning way,
" said the 24-year-old Wang.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the evening, Wang's national teammates Ma Lin and Ma
Long beat Germany's Timo Boll and Singapore's Yang Zi for the
semis, while Wang Liqin came out the winner of an all-Chinese
quarterfinal against younger Chen Qi.
