PARIS, April 21 (Xinhua)
</P>
<P>
French President Nicolas Sarkozy is set to meet with United
Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) Director General
Jacques Diouf Tuesday to discuss the " ongoing world food
crisis," the French presidential palace announced Monday.
</P>
<P>
"The president and Diouf will notably discuss the issue of a
Global Partnership for Food and Agriculture that he wants to
establish to spearhead efforts to revive the production of food
crops in developing countries, which is the long- term solution
to the current crisis," the presidential palace said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
"This revival may represent a real opportunity for the economic
development of Africa in particular," according to the same
source.
</P>
<P>
Friday, Nicolas Sarkozy announced that he intended to double the
amount of food aid that is normally given by France annually to
60 million euros (about 100 million U.S. dollars) starting this
year.
</P>
<P>
Addressing reporters on the same day, The FAO chief had expressed
confidence that food production could be doubled in the world
within the next five years, "if governments marshaled the
prerequisite political will."
</P>
<P>
The issue of soaring food prices, which has already led to riots
in a number of African, Asian and Caribbean countries, has
captured the imagination of the world community, with many
leaders concurring that it represented a serious threat to world
security.
</P>
<P>
Last week, International Monetary Fund (IMF) Director General
Dominique Strauss- Kahn had called on world countries to halt the
production of biofuels from food crops, saying that it was
"posing a real moral problem" as it had resulted in a food crisis
in poor countries.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on, UN Special Rapporteur for the Right to Food Jean
Ziegler had argued that the mass production of biofuels was "a
crime against humanity" because of its impact on the soaring
world food prices.
</P>
<P>
The current unprecedented surge in the prices of basic foodstuffs
and energy products has led to the riots in Haiti and Egypt as
well as a general strike in Burkina Faso and several other West
African countries.
