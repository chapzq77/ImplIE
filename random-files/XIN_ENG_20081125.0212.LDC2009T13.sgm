Israel to benefit by having democratic Palestinian state: Bush
</HEADLINE>

WASHINGTON, Nov. 24 (Xinhua)
</P>
<P>
Israel will benefit by having a democratic Palestinian state that
works for peace, U.S. President George W. Bush said Monday.
</P>
<P>
"We strongly believe that Israel will benefit by having a
Palestinian state, a democracy on her border that works for
peace," Bush said before a meeting with Israeli Prime Minister
Ehud Olmert at the White House.
</P>
<P>
"Prime Minister, that vision is alive because of you. I thank you
for your steadfast support for peace. ... I just want you to know
that I believe that vision is alive and needs to be worked on,"
said Bush, referring the two-state solution for the Palestinian-
Israeli conflict, proposed by his administration after the 9/11
terrorist attack.
</P>
<P>
Echoing Bush's views, Olmert said: "It continues with your
guidance and support and inspiration. And this is very important,
because as you say, a two-state solution is the only possible way
to resolve the conflict in the Middle East."
</P>
<P>
The Bush-Olmert meeting is expected to focus on "the strong
bilateral relationship between the United States and Israel, our
continuing mutual efforts to bring peace to the Middle East, and
a wide range of regional and international issues," White House
deputy press secretary Tony Fratto told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Olmert met with Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and Vice
President Dick Cheney prior to his meeting with Bush, which was
described by the Israeli newspaper Haaretz as "the farewell
dinner for the outgoing leaders."
</P>
<P>
Bush will leave office on Jan. 20, 2009, while the Israeli prime
minister, who resigned in September amid corruption charges, is
expected to remain in office until a new government is formed
after a February 10 election.
