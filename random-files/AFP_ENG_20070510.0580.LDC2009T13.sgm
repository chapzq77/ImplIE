More than one in 10 of the fatalities recorded on Greek roads is
a foreigner, the Greek government said on Thursday, announcing a
safety initiative to better inform those from abroad.
</P>
<P>
In 2006, 176 non-Greeks died and 287 were seriously injured in
road accidents around the country, accounting for 11.8 percent
and 14 percent of total figures, the public order ministry said.
</P>
<P>
"The participation of foreign citizens in traffic accidents is
increasing," the ministry said, ordering police departments
around the country to organise information initiatives in their
areas of responsibility.
</P>
<P>
Greece has one of the highest road death tolls in the European
Union. Only Portugal, Lithuania and Latvia have worse records,
according to a recent report.
</P>
<P>
In 2006, 1,629 people died on Greek roads, according to the
national statistics office (ESYE), an increase of 0.9 percent
despite a decrease in the number of actual accidents.
</P>
<P>
The figures have been stable since 2003 when the government
launched a series of initiatives to reduce road traffic
accidents. Experts blame bad roads, bad drivers and a lack of
traffic police for the poor record.
