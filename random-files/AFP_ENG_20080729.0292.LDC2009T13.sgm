Iran says nuclear talks 'positive and progressive'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Iran's top nuclear negotiator Saeed Jalili said on Tuesday that
talks with world powers aimed at resolving the crisis over its
atomic drive were "positive and progressive," local media
reported.
</P>
<P>
"The negotiations have been positive and progressive, and in
Geneva the seven nations got a better understanding of one
another views," Jalili was quoted as saying by the Mehr news
agency.
</P>
<P>
He was referring to his talks on July 19 with representatives of
major powers including EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana and,
for the first time, an official from Tehran's arch-foe the United
States, William Burns.
</P>
<P>
In Geneva, Iran was set a two-week deadline which expires on to
give a final answer to world powers who have offered a package of
incentives to try to persuade Tehran to halt sensitive nuclear
work.
</P>
<P>
But Iran has rejected any deadline, saying it was agreed in
Geneva that it would during a two week period examine the
proposal put forward by permanent UN Security Council members
Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States plus
Germany.
</P>
<P>
The six nations, concerned that Tehran is pursuing a clandestine
nuclear weapons project, have offered to start pre-negotiations
during which time Tehran would face no further sanctions if it
did not add any more uranium-enriching centrifuges.
</P>
<P>
The package, offered to Iran in June, includes trade incentives
and help with a civilian nuclear programme in return for
suspending enrichment.
</P>
<P>
Iran is under three sets of UN Security Council sanctions over
its refusal to halt uranium enrichment, a process which makes
nuclear fuel but can also create the fissile core of an atomic
bomb.
</P>
<P>
Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said in an interview with
US television on Monday that if the United States adopted a
genuinely new approach to his country Tehran would respond in a
positive way.
</P>
<P>
He also denied that Iran was working to manufacture a nuclear
bomb.
</P>
<P>
The interview followed Ahmadinejad's announcement on Saturday
that Iran had boosted the number of uranium-enriching centrifuges
to 6,000, in an expansion of its nuclear drive that defies the
international calls for a freeze.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Defence Minister Ehud Barak, whose country considers Iran
its greatest threat, urged the United States during a visit to
Washington to keep all options open in dealing with Iran's
nuclear programme.
</P>
<P>
"A policy that consists of keeping all options on the table must
be maintained," Barak told US Defence Secretary Robert Gates, his
ministry said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"Iran's plans pose a threat to regional and global stability. We
insist that it is vital to continue tightening the economic and
financial sanctions imposed on the Iranians."
</P>
<P>
Israel is widely believed to be the only nuclear armed state in
the Middle East although it has a policy of neither confirming or
denying it has a nuclear arsenal and does not allow international
inspections.
