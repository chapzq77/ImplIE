MONTEVIDEO, Uruguay 2007-02-14 05:45:32 UTC

<P>
Defensor beat Argentine visitor Gimnasia y Esgrima 3-0 in the
Group 8 opening match of Copa Libertadores soccer on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Also, Argentina's Velez Sarsfield beat Emelec of Ecuador 1-0 and
Cucuta Deportivo and Deportes Tolima drew 0-0 in Bogota.
</P>
<P>
In Montevideo, Sebastian Ariosa scored in the 36th minute, and
Carlos Morales and Maximiliano Pereira added goals after halftime
before 15,000 fans at Centenario.
</P>
<P>
Gimnasia's only near miss was Santiago Silva's shot off the
crossbeam.
</P>
<P>
In Guayaquil, Ecuador, Marcelo Bustamante scored off a 13th
minute free kick by Mauro Zarate to lead Velez Sarsfield over
Emelec to open Group 4.
</P>
<P>
Zarate and Bustamente were aggressive throughout, but scored no
other goals at George Capwell stadium on a balmy night before a
crowd of 20,000.
</P>
<P>
Emelec debuted Argentines players Jeronimo Morales and Cesar
Asis, Colombian Sebastian Hernandez, and Paraguayan Israel
Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
Morales missed clear opportunities to score in the 16th, 55th,
and 58th minutes.
</P>
<P>
Colombian champion Cucuta squandered the advantages of an extra
man and home field in its Copa Libertadores debut. Tolima
defender Yesid Martinez was expelled after 57 minutes when he
received his second yellow card for a rough tackle.
</P>
<P>
But Cucuta still struggled before its 22,000 fans to awake from
the slumber that characterized play by both teams for much of the
Group 3 match.
</P>
<P>
Except for a few shots on goal by Panamanian striker Blas Perez,
Cucuta failed to demonstrate the strong attack it showed
throughout last year's local championship under coach Jorge Luis
Pinto, who in December was called up to lead the struggling
national team back to the World Cup for the first time since
1998.
