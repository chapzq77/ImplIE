Climate change means hunger and thirst for billions: report
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Billions of people will suffer water shortages and the number of
hungry will grow by hundreds of millions by 2080 as global
temperatures rise, scientists warn in a report leaked Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The report estimates that between 1.1 billion and 3.2 billion
people will be suffering from water scarcity problems by 2080 and
between 200 million and 600 million more people will be going
hungry.
</P>
<P>
The assessment is contained in a draft of a major international
report by the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)
to be released later this year, Australia's The Age newspaper
said.
</P>
<P>
Rising sea levels could flood seven million more homes, while
Australia's famed Great Barrier Reef, treasured as the world's
largest living organism, could be dead within decades, the
scientists warn, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The Age said it had obtained a copy of the report, believed to be
one of three prepared for release by the IPCC, which is highly
regarded for its neutrality and caution.
</P>
<P>
Some 500 experts are meeting in Paris this week ahead of the
release on Friday of the IPCC's first report since 2001 on the
state of scientific knowledge on global warming.
</P>
<P>
The report will be followed in April by volumes focusing on the
impacts of climate change and on the social-economic costs of
reducing the emission of greenhouse gases blamed for global
warming.
</P>
<P>
A chapter on Australia in the report on global impacts warns that
coral bleaching in the Barrier Reef is likely to become an annual
occurrence by as early as 2030 due to warmer, more acidic seas.
</P>
<P>
Bleaching occurs when the plant-like organisms that make up coral
die and leave behind the white limestone skeleton of the reef.
</P>
<P>
The World Heritage site, stretching over more than 345,000 square
kilometers (133,000 sq miles) off Australia's northeast coast,
will become "functionally extinct", the scientists are quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Average global temperatures have already risen about 0.7 to 0.8
degrees since 1900, which the report says contributed to
increased bleaching in coral reefs in the Caribbean and the
Indian Ocean.
</P>
<P>
At 2.0 to 3.0 degrees above 1900 levels, the report predicts the
"complete loss" of Australia's alpine zones and the possible
collapse of South America's Amazon forest system, causing a "huge
loss of biodiversity".
</P>
<P>
The human and economic costs of climate change are likely to be
highest in poor countries, with water shortages crippling many
African nations and increased coastal flooding hitting low-lying
countries such as Bangladesh and many Pacific islands, the report
says.
