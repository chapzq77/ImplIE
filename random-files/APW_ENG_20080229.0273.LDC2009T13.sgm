Memphis airport

Two FedEx jets got too close to each other on takeoff from the
Memphis airport last week because of confusion over flight
numbers for the planes, a Federal Aviation Administration
spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
The incident, which the FAA classified as serious, air traffic
control error, remained under investigation.
</P>
<P>
The air traffic controllers union blamed the incident and other
recent mistakes by controllers at Memphis on short staffing and
forced overtime.
</P>
<P>
Kathleen Bergen, an FAA spokeswoman in Atlanta, disagreed
Thursday. "We have never found fatigue to be an issue in any of
the errors that have occurred at Memphis," Bergen said.
</P>
<P>
On Feb. 21, two FedEx jets flying in the same direction on
takeoff came within 200 feet (60 meters) vertically and three-
fourths of a mile (1.2 kilometers) horizontally to each other,
Bergen said. Big jets in the Memphis area are supposed to keep a
distance of at least 1,000 feet (300 meters) vertically and 3
miles (5 kilometers) horizontally.
</P>
<P>
"Those airplanes were extremely close together and that's just
seconds away from the two of them hitting," said Ron Carpenter,
local president of the National Air Traffic Controllers
Association.
</P>
<P>
Bergen said the flights had similar numbers -- 527 and 257 --
that caused confusion sending one plane on a wrong turn shortly
after they took off at the same time on separate runways.
</P>
<P>
The incident began with the pilot of one plane getting on the
wrong radio frequency "and accepting instructions intended for
another aircraft," Bergen said. FAA rules require pilots to read
back flight instructions and for controllers to make sure they
were properly received.
</P>
<P>
"The controller didn't recognize the error on read-back," Bergen
said.
</P>
<P>
Bergen said the controller was decertified and will be retrained.
The pilot's error was still under investigation.
</P>
<P>
FedEx declined comment, noting the investigation was ongoing.
