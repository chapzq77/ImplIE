Eleonore Schoenfeld, a renowned cellist and music professor best
known as half of the Schoenfeld Duo with her violinist sister
Alice, has died, the University of Southern California said. She
was 81.
</P>
<P>
Eleonore and Alice Schoenfeld lived, worked and played music
together from childhood until Eleonore's death Jan. 1 of a heart
attack in the home they shared in La Canada Flintridge,
California. Neither married nor had children.
</P>
<P>
Alice remains on the faculty at USC's Thornton School of Music,
where the sisters had been professors for nearly 50 years.
Eleonore Schoenfeld was teaching and serving as head of the
school's strings department at the time of her death.
</P>
<P>
Born in Slovenia to a Russian mother and Polish father, Eleonore
Schoenfeld studied ballet before switching to the cello at age
11. The older Alice had already begun studying violin. The two
performed around Europe as child prodigies and already had a
flourishing adult career before moving to Los Angeles in 1952.
</P>
<P>
Eleonore Schoenfeld later had her own performing career in
addition to her better-known work with her sister, playing as a
soloist with orchestras on four continents.
</P>
<P>
"To follow Eleonore's career is like a portrait of music making
and teaching in the 20th century," Robert Cutietta, dean of the
Thornton School of Music, said Friday in a statement. "She was
not only a legendary figure in the Thornton School and Los
Angeles, where she helped the classical music scene mature and
prosper in the years following World War II, but her reputation
spread throughout the world."
</P>
<P>
A memorial service was planned for Monday in Pasadena.
