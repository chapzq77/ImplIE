Democrats passes short-term spending bill but differences remain

WASHINGTON 2007-12-13 20:28:33 UTC
</P>
<P>
Congressional Democrats pressed ahead Thursday with a bill to
keep the U.S. government open for another week as lawmakers
fashioned an omnibus spending bill and sought agreement among
themselves and with the White House.
</P>
<P>
The House passed the short-term funding bill by a 385-27 vote;
the Senate will clear the bill for President George W. Bush
signing before the current temporary funding bill runs out
Friday. It would fund through Dec. 21 the 14 Cabinet departments
whose budgets have yet to pass.
</P>
<P>
It is expected the omnibus measure will pass by then, allowing
Congress to finally adjourn for the year.
</P>
<P>
Democrats announced Wednesday they would all but surrender to
President George W. Bush's demand that lawmakers appropriate no
more than $933 billion (euro635.4 billion) for annual operating
expenses for Cabinet departments whose budgets are set each year
by Congress.
</P>
<P>
Democrats hoped to make an exception for a $3.7 billion (euro2.5
billion) increase for veterans health care, calculating that Bush
and his Republican allies in Congress would relent in the case of
the politically sacrosanct program.
</P>
<P>
But Democrats had yet to resolve differences among themselves,
much less with the White House. Differences over Iraq and whether
to cut back lawmakers' hometown projects are among issues still
to be resolved.
</P>
<P>
"I have no agreement at this stage with the people in the House,
the Republicans in the Senate, and the White House," said Senate
Majority Leader Harry Reid, a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
The White House was quick to say it had not signed on to the
Democrats' measure, awaiting details of the bill's final cost,
the funding mix within accounts, and the resolution of its
request for additional Iraq and Afghanistan war funds.
</P>
<P>
"We're hopeful and encouraged by the movement that we're seeing
on the Hill right now," said White House budget office spokesman
Sean Kevelighan.
</P>
<P>
The White House does not believe the additional veterans money is
needed and previously has issued veto threats if the money for
veterans is not accompanied by cuts elsewhere in the budget. That
approach has been widely seen as unrealistic, even by top
Republicans like House Minority Leader John Boehner.
</P>
<P>
But with the White House playing such a strong hand in the
negotiations, Boehner now insists Democrats stick within the
president's $933 billion (euro635.4 billion) figure, with
exceptions for border security and a few other "emergencies."
</P>
<P>
The issue of Iraq has yet to be resolved, though expectations
were growing that Senate Democrats would relent and allow
Republicans to provide up to $70 billion (euro47.6 billion) in
new war funds to the measure, without restrictions that have
provoked Bush veto threats, such as a December 2008 target date
for withdrawing combat troops.
</P>
<P>
The bill will not carry Iraq aid when passing the House next
week, though Democrats have said they will attach about $30
billion (euro20.4 billion) for U.S. operations in Afghanistan and
some domestic Pentagon needs.
</P>
<P>
Democrats' decision to largely hew to Bush's budget demand caps
months of wrangling. Democrats initially crafted bills adding $23
billion (euro15.6 billion) above Bush's budget, devoting the
funding to increases for domestic programs such as health
research, education, grants to state and local governments and
energy research.
</P>
<P>
More recently, Democrats worked with pragmatic appropriations
panel Republicans such as Sen. Thad Cochran and Rep. James Walsh
to craft a split-the-differences bill cutting $11 billion
(euro7.4 billion) from the earlier Democratic measures. That
effort collapsed after a White House issued a veto threat
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Now, lawmakers led by House Appropriations Committee Chairman
David Obey and his Senate counterpart Robert Byrd, both
Democrats, are squeezing the remaining funding bills by another
1.6 percent, said a Byrd spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The measure would fund every Cabinet department except the
Pentagon. Under Bush's budget, domestic Cabinet departments other
than Homeland Security and Veterans Affairs would see their
budgets frozen. Considering inflation and population gains, that
means most programs would not be able to deliver a comparable
level of services next year as they do now.
