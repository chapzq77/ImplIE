JIUQUAN, Gansu, Sept. 21 (Xinhua)
</P>
<P>
A panel of six Chinese astronauts arrived at Jiuquan Satellite
Launch Center in northwestern Gansu Province on Sunday, making
the last-minute preparations for the country's third manned space
mission.
</P>
<P>
Taking a special flight to the remote center, three qualified
spacemen and three substitutes said they had "full confidence to
successfully accomplish the mission" after various trainings and
tests.
</P>
<P>
The astronauts will pilot spacecraft Shenzhou-7 to carry out the
mission during which one of them will spacewalk outside the
capsule.
</P>
<P>
The spacecraft has been planned to be launched at an appropriate
time between Sept. 25 and 30 after the spaceship, its carrier
Long-March II-F rocket and the escape tower were vertically
transferred to the launch pad on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
All the six astronauts prepared for Shenzhou-7 were once trained
and tested at Jiuquan center more than two weeks ago when they
had a live experience to enter the spaceship and learned the
mission's whole process in an all-ready simulation.
</P>
<P>
The six spacemen now had moved to their special accommodation to
be quarantined and to adjust their psychological conditions for
the mission.
</P>
<P>
The Long-March II-F rocket, developed in 1992, is said to be the
most complicated and reliable carrier rocket in China's aviation
history with all its launch mission successfully finished. So far
the rocket had sent two manned spacecraft and four unmanned into
space.
</P>
<P>
Since October 1996, the Long-March series rockets have
successfully launched for 108 times. The Shenzhou-7 project will
be its 109th mission.
</P>
<P>
According to Jin Muchun, chief rocket system designer of the
mission, the Long- March II-F will be given a thorough upgrade
after sending the Shenzhou-7.
</P>
<P>
"The upgrading work will be finished by two steps," Jin told
Xinhua. "all its technical parameters and designs will be
replaced."
</P>
<P>
According to Jin, the first step will make the rocket lighter,
smaller, more powerful and more integrated by improving its
controlling and guiding parts and electronic devices.
</P>
<P>
The second step will change the fuel of the rocket, replacing its
current combustion-supporting material by a new generation of
full liquid oxygen.
</P>
<P>
On April 12, China launched a new space tracking ship to serve
the Shenzhou-7 spacewalk mission.
</P>
<P>
The new ship and its sister, Yuanwang-5 which was put into use a
year ago, will play a key role in monitoring and controlling the
Shenzhou-7 mission.
</P>
<P>
China successfully put two manned spacecraft into orbit in 2003
and 2005, respectively, becoming the third country to send an
astronaut into space after the United States and the Soviet Union
(now Russia).
