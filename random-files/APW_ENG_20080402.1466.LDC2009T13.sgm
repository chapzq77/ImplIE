A University of Washington professor says a recently discovered
fish that crawls instead of swimming and has forward-looking eyes
like humans could be part of an entirely unknown family of
fishes.

The creature sighted in Indonesian waters off Ambon Island has
tan- and peach-colored zebra-stripping. It uses its leglike
pectoral fins to burrow into cracks and crevices of coral reefs
in search of food.

UW professor Ted Pietsch says this relative of the anglerfish
will have to undergo DNA scrutiny to verify that it is unique.
But the world's leading authority on anglerfish says he's never
seen anything like it.

<P>
Pietsch says they have probably escaped notice until now because
they are so good at sliding into narrow crevices.
