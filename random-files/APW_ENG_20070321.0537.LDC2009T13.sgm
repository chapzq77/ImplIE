A bridge collapsed under an overloaded truck in Guinea, throwing
scores of passengers into a river and killing at least 70, the
West African country's state radio reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The truck was ferrying merchandise and people back from a local
market near the southeastern town of Gueckedou when the accident
occurred Sunday, state-run RTG radio reported.

<P>
The 50-year-old rock and cement bridge collapsed as the truck was
crossing, tipping the vehicle and sending people as well as bags
of cement and sacks of rice crashing into the river. Many of the
dead drowned, trapped under the merchandise, RTG said.
</P>
<P>
At least 20 people were injured and were taken to hospital, the
radio station reported. Some later died of their injuries. The
death toll rose from 65 overnight to 70 Wednesday morning, the
radio said, citing hospital sources.

Hospital officials could not be immediately reached for comment.

Guinea, a country of 10 million on Africa's West Coast, is deeply
impoverished despite having half the world's supply of bauxite --
the raw material used to make aluminum -- as well as iron ore,
gold and diamonds.
</P>
<P>
In rural areas where buses are rare, large open-backed trucks are
often a main form of transport -- carrying sacks of grain, sheep,
bicycles and people between villages. Trucks are often piled high
with merchandise, and then passengers climb on top, or hang onto
the sides of the vehicle.
