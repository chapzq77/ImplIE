China gives blanket coverage to snow disaster stories

BEIJING, Feb. 4 (Xinhua)
</P>
<P>
Over the past three weeks, most front-page stories in the Chinese
media have been about the country's heaviest snowfall in five
decades.
</P>
<P>
Many newspapers, including the People's Daily, run by the
Communist Party of China (CPC), on Monday led with a front-page
story about a warning from top Chinese leaders that weather
conditions in the country's south will remain severe and relief
work a difficult task. The warning came after a CPC politburo
meeting chaired by President Hu Jintao.
</P>
<P>
Local newspapers in areas hardly hit by the crisis ran moving
snow features, telling of trivial but meaningful stories amid
snowstorms and disaster relief.
</P>
<P>
The Southern Metropolis News, based in booming Guangdong
Province, ran several small stories showing how ordinary Chinese
coped with the disaster. It featured a couple stranded by
snowfall on the way to their wedding ceremony in southwest
Sichuan. Instead, they tied the knot on the road as Chinese
tradition holds that wedding ceremonies should be held on good
occasion that promises auspiciousness.
</P>
<P>
Despite the snowfall transport chaos, at a time when millions are
trying to get home for the upcoming Spring Festival, people have
shown great determination to be reunited with their loved ones.
One traveled 400 kilometers on foot to see his girlfriend, while
another skied 200 km to get home, local newspapers said.
</P>
<P>
Television news also covered the People's Liberation Army (PLA)
soldiers de- icing activities and sending supplies to disaster
areas. Their tactics including shooting power lines with
submachine guns to shatter the ice and resorting to tanks to
crush ice on the road. Helicopters, aircraft, field kitchen
trucks and other armored cars were all in use.
</P>
<P>
The Modern Express, a newspaper based in Nanjing, capital of
eastern Jiangsu, covered its entire front page with a photo
showing an armored vehicle breaking up ice on an expressway.
</P>
<P>
Earlier front page coverage in Chinese media included senior
leaders visiting disaster affected areas. A full-size picture on
the Beijing Times front page showed Premier Wen Jiabao paying his
respects to the relatives of three power company workers in
Changsha, capital of central Hunan Province.
</P>
<P>
The three workers died last month while de-icing a tower. They
fell off the 50-meter structure after their support equipment
failed. "A soulful bowing," read the caption.
</P>
<P>
The snow, the heaviest in decades in many places, has been
falling in China's eastern, central and southern regions for
almost three weeks. It has caused death, structural collapse,
blackouts, accidents, transport problems and livestock and crop
destruction.
