EU to resume Gaza fuel aid after days of blackouts
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The European Union said it will resume financing fuel deliveries
to the Gaza Strip's sole power plant on Wednesday, after five
days of blackouts in the impoverished Palestinian territory.
</P>
<P>
"In agreement with the Palestinian Authority, the (European)
commission will resume Wednesday, on a provisional basis,
deliveries of fuel to the Gaza power plant," said a statement
from an EU spokeswoman received by AFP in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
No further details were immediately available.
</P>
<P>
The EU suspended financing fuel deliveries for Gaza's power plant
-- which provides some 25 percent of electricity in the territory
-- over fears that Hamas would benefit from the aid.
</P>
<P>
The EU blacklists Hamas as a terror group and refuses to have any
dealings with the Islamists. If it provides fuel to a power
plant, and Hamas earns money from that plant's production, the
bloc could be seen to be indirectly financing the movement.
</P>
<P>
The bloc had said it would resume payments as soon as it was
given assurances to the contrary by the Islamists, who seized
control in Gaza in a bloody takeover in mid-June.
</P>
<P>
Parts of Gaza have suffered from blackouts since late Friday,
when the power plant reduced output because of dwindling fuel
supplies.
</P>
<P>
Hamas had earlier denied it had diverted money from the
electricity company after it seized control of Gaza two months
ago and said it would provide guarantees that the utility would
function independently.
</P>
<P>
"To ensure the people's right to be free of electrical power
cuts, the government will give verifiable guarantees that the
electricity company will work independently as mandated and
without any interference from the factions," the office of sacked
Hamas premier Ismail Haniya said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
At a Hamas meeting, Haniya said that the "electricity company is
independent and there is no interference in its administrative
affairs... This is part of the pressure exerted on Gaza and
attempts to break our will."
</P>
<P>
Hamas said the power cuts amounted to a "collective punishment of
the residents of Gaza (which) violates all international values
and norms."
</P>
<P>
The Western-backed Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas called for
the fuel supplies to be resumed, but said his Hamas rivals were
to blame for the outages as it was pocketing money from
electricity sales.
</P>
<P>
"The continuation of these power cuts are causing incommensurate
harm to the life of our people, who are not guilty of the
banditry by Hamas and its militias," he was quoted by his office
as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said the fuel cuts were "the result of the illegal takeover of
control electricity company by the Hamas putschists, and the
collecting of citizens' (electricity) bills to pay members of its
militia."
</P>
<P>
Hamas has denied the allegations, saying it had arrested the head
of the electricity company on charges of corruption.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians have been split into two separate entities since
Hamas routed security forces loyal to Abbas from Gaza on June 15,
with the Western-shunned Islamists running the coastal strip and
the Western-backed president ruling the occupied West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, which provides between five and 10 percent of Gaza's
electricity, said the supplies should not be used for political
ends.
</P>
<P>
"Agreements to supply electricity to Gaza's inhabitants should
remain as they are and no party, whoever they might be, should
use basic utilities as poitical cards," foreign ministry
spokesman Hossam Zaki said in a statement.
