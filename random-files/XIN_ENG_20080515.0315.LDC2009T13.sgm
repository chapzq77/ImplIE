YINGXIU TOWN, Sichuan, May 15 (Xinhua)
</P>
<P>
Plague could break out in quake-hit areas if victims' bodies were
not buried soon, a local official told Xinhua on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Many bodies are trapped in debris and heavy-lifting gear cannot
get through blocked roads to the disaster areas, said Bai
Licheng, a senior Communist Party official of the Aba prefecture
in Sichuan Province.
</P>
<P>
Since the destructive earthquake on Monday, Bai has been
searching for survivors with a rescue team in Yingxiu of Wenchuan
County, epicenter of the quake.
</P>
<P>
High temperatures would quicken the rotting of bodies, and plague
would break out, he warned.
</P>
<P>
Some bodies are put together on the ground in the town, and there
is already bad smell in the air.
</P>
<P>
"We are in urgent need of body bags," Bai said, adding there is
an urgent need for food and water.
</P>
<P>
"Air-dropped food and drinking water are limited and far from
meeting the demand," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said some survivors have fetched water from a mountain spring,
but it is unclear if the water is safe for drinking.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday afternoon, Gao Qiang, deputy health minister, vowed
that the central government aims to prevent the outbreak of
large-scale epidemic.
</P>
<P>
He said the bodies of the dead would be handled properly as soon
as possible to prevent harmful bacteria from growing.
</P>
<P>
"We should not add to the losses caused by natural disasters and
let people suffer more just because we have not done our job
well," said Gao.
</P>
<P>
The military sources just revealed that four temporary bridge had
been built Thursday over the Zipingpu reservoir in Dujiangyan
City, connecting the city with Yingxiu town.
</P>
<P>
Large-sized rescue equipments, including heavy-lifting gear,
excavators, and bulldozers, and large number of troops would be
sent into the epicenter, an officer with the Chengdu Military
Area said.
</P>
<P>
At 8:20 p.m., the air force also began to airdrop large-sized
rescue equipments to Yingxiu. The equipment would improve the
efficiency of rescue missions carried out by the army, the
military source said.
</P>
<P>
Chinese army and armed police personnel Thursday have reached all
58 counties and townships severely damaged in Monday's quake.
