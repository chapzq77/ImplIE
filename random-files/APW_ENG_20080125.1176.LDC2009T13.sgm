Mary-Kate Olsen calls Heath Ledger a "friend" in a brief
statement released Friday, the first word from the "Full House"
star since the Australian-born actor's death.
</P>
<P>
Released by her publicist, the statement, in its entirety, reads:
</P>
<P>
"Heath was a friend. His death is a tragic loss. My thoughts are
with his family during this very difficult time."
</P>
<P>
Police said the masseuse who found Ledger's body Tuesday spent
nine minutes making three calls to Olsen before dialing the
police-fire emergency dispatcher for help. The masseuse called
Olsen a fourth time after paramedics arrived.
</P>
<P>
At some point during the frenzy, Olsen, who was in California,
summoned her personal security guards to the apartment to help,
police said. Police told The Associated Press on Friday that they
do not want to interview the actress in connection with the
calls.
</P>
<P>
Olsen's whereabouts were unknown Friday. A private viewing was
scheduled for Friday at the Frank E. Campbell funeral home in
Manhattan, and Ledger's family was flying to the U.S. from his
native Australia.
