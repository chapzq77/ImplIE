NEW YORK 2008-11-05 22:12:30 UTC

A case of postelection nerves sent Wall Street plunging Wednesday
as investors absorbed a stream of bad economic news abd wondered
how a Barack Obama presidency will help the country weather a
possibly severe recession. Volatility returned to the market,
with the Dow Jones industrials falling nearly 500 points and all
the major indexes tumbling more than 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The market was expected to give back some gains after a six-day
runup that lifted the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index more than
18 percent. But investors lost their recent confidence about the
economy and began dumping stocks again; light volume helped
exaggerate the price swings.
</P>
<P>
"The market has really gotten ahead of itself, and falsely priced
in that this recession wasn't going to be as prolonged as
thought," said Ryan Larson, head of equity trading at Voyageur
Asset Management, a subsidiary of RBC Dain Rauscher.
</P>
<P>
"We're in a really bad recession, period," he said. "Wall Street
can spin it anyway they want to, but this is likely going to be
more prolonged than people anticipated. People are locking in
profits and realizing we're not out of the woods."
</P>
<P>
Beyond broad economic concerns, worries about the financial
sector intensified after Goldman Sachs Group Inc. began to notify
about 3,200 employees globally that they have been lost their
jobs as part of a broader plan to slash 10 percent of the
investment bank's work force, a person familiar with the
situation said. The cuts were first reported last month. Goldman
fell 8 percent, while other financial names also fell; Citigroup
Inc. dropped 14 percent.
</P>
<P>
Commodities stocks also fell after steelmaker ArcelorMittal said
it would slash production because of weakening demand. Its stock
plunged 21.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Although the market expected Obama to win the election, as the
session wore on investors were clearly worrying about the
weakness of the economy and pondered what the Obama
administration might do to help it. Analysts said the market is
already anxious about who Obama selects as the next Treasury
Secretary, as well as who he picks for other Cabinet positions.
</P>
<P>
"The celebration is over. Today we saw a bit of reality," said Al
Goldman, chief market strategist at Wachovia Securities in St.
Louis. "President-elect Obama is coming into a situation with
limited experience, having to handle an economy in serious
trouble, a couple of wars and terrorism. It's an extremely tough
job."
</P>
<P>
Analysts said investors were also uneasy in advance of the Labor
Department's October employment report, to be issued Friday.
Economists, on average, expect a 200,000 drop in payrolls,
according to Thomson/IFR.
</P>
<P>
Late-day selling by hedge funds helped deepen the market's losses
during the last hour. More selling by the funds is expected to
weigh on the market ahead of a Nov. 15 cutoff for shareholders to
notify fund managers of their intent to cash out investments
before year-end.
</P>
<P>
The Dow fell 486.01, or 5.05 percent, to 9,139.27.
</P>
<P>
The S&amp;P 500 index fell 52.98, or 5.27 percent, to 952.77.
Through the six sessions that ended Tuesday, the index, the one
most closely watched by market professionals, rose 18.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Nasdaq composite index fell 98.48, or 5.53 percent, to
1,681.64, while the Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell
31.33, or 5.74 percent, to 514.64.
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advancers by about 4 to 1 on the New
York Stock Exchange, where volume came to a light 1.31 billion
shares.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's trading, which followed a 300-point jump in the Dow
on Tuesday, showed that the market is living up to expectations
of continued volatility as it tries to recover from the
devastating losses of the last two months.
</P>
<P>
Bill Stone, chief investment strategist at PNC Wealth Management,
said the uncertainty over the direction the government's
financial bailout plan will take under the next administration
likely weighed on financial stocks Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Analysts agree that Obama's most immediate priority will be
dealing with the nation's financial crisis and deciding how to
further implement the $700 billion rescue package passed by
Congress last month.
</P>
<P>
Goldman said trading could remain turbulent as investors begin
assessing the shape and direction of Obama's forthcoming economic
policies.
</P>
<P>
"The market has to go through a period of figuring out if they
are going to gain confidence in Obama and the Congress or lose
it," he said, adding that investors will be paying close
attention to who will be appointed to top economic posts.
</P>
<P>
Obama's victory means that industries such as oil and gas
producers, utilities and pharmaceuticals may face greater
regulation and even taxes, while labor unions and automakers are
expected to benefit.
</P>
<P>
In addition, banks, insurance companies, hedge funds and the rest
of the financial sector will almost certainly face attempts at a
regulatory overhaul by the Democratic Congress next year.
</P>
<P>
Bank of America Corp. dropped $2.78, or 11.3 percent, to $21.75.
Citigroup fell $2.05, or 14 percent, to $12.63. Morgan Stanley,
meanwhile, tumbled $1.84, or 9.7 percent, to $17.06. Goldman
Sachs fell $7.57, or 8 percent, to $87.43.
</P>
<P>
In addition to monitoring the direction the next administration
will take, investors continue to heed the state of the credit
markets. The paralysis in the credit markets that began after the
bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. in mid-September has
been alleviated somewhat by a series of government interventions,
but they still show some signs of strain.
</P>
<P>
Banks continued to ratchet down the rates they charge one another
for borrowing on Wednesday, but the key interbank lending rate --
the London Interbank Offered Rate, or Libor -- remains well above
the Federal Reserve's target interest rate of 1 percent. Libor
for three-month dollar loans fell to 2.51 percent from 2.71
percent Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
And the bid for Treasury bills remains high. The three-month
bill, considered one of the safest assets around, fell to 0.40
percent from 0.48 percent late Tuesday. A low yield indicates
high demand.
</P>
<P>
The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell slightly to
3.71 percent from 3.73 percent late Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The dollar was mixed against other major currencies, while gold
prices fell.
</P>
<P>
Other sectors that are being closely watched in light of the
election results are pharmaceuticals and alternative energy,
analysts said.
</P>
<P>
Merck &amp; Co. fell $2.41, or 7.7 percent, to $28.72. Pfizer
Inc., meanwhile, dipped $1.09, or 6 percent, to $17. SunTech
Power Holdings Co. was among the alternative energy stocks that
declined, falling $6.82, or 21.5 percent, to $24.88.
