IN THE END, TENNESSEE LIVES UP TO SEEDING
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BIRMINGHAM, Ala.
</P>
<P>
Garrison Carr, an American University guard, had just made
another 3-pointer and the 15th-seeded Eagles trailed by a point
with six minutes remaining against second-seeded Tennessee on
Friday in the first round of the NCAA tournament.
</P>
<P>
"Scared?" Tennessee forward Tyler Smith said. "I wouldn't say
scared. Well, maybe a little bit because you're wondering what if
they keep hitting those shots."
</P>
<P>
The arena section where American fans were sitting was revved up
and hoping for more of Carr. The American band played the song
"Don't Stop Believin"' and a fan held up a sign that read "The
American Dream."
</P>
<P>
The dream was about to end. Carr did not make another 3-pointer,
and the Volunteers (29-4) went on a 10-4 burst in a difficult
72-57 victory over the Eagles (21-11).
</P>
<P>
Carr, a 5-foot-11 junior from the Seattle area, scored a game-
high 26 points, making 9 of 21 field goals. For most of the game,
he made things interesting by throwing in 3-pointers from the
wing after exhausting most of the shot clock, as well as the
Tennessee defense.
</P>
<P>
American outrebounded a taller Tennessee team, 39-27, by
spreading out the Volunteers on defense. The Tennessee big men
were stuck outside trying to help on screens being set for Carr.
</P>
<P>
"It's really not a checkout situation," Tennessee coach Bruce
Pearl said. "It's a race to the boards."
</P>
<P>
The difference in the game was a two-minute stretch that ended
with about four minutes left in the second half and with
Tennessee holding a comfortable lead. JaJuan Smith, a 6-foot-2
senior guard, was playing tough defense on Carr, staying closer
than arm's reach, and would not let him get another good look at
the rim.
</P>
<P>
"Coach Pearl told me to go get him," Smith said. "I turned it
into a one-on-one game on the defensive end, me against him. I
wasn't going to help anybody on defense, just stay on him."
</P>
<P>
When Carr hit his 3-pointer with six minutes left, drawing
American to 50-49, Smith retaliated with a 3-pointer for
Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
"At that moment, we had the opportunity to control the game, but
we made a big play and Tennessee came right back down and knocked
a 3 down," Carr said. "And while we were making our run, they
just played like the No. 2 seed and like a No. 1 team in the
nation, and they made their runs right back and they didn't let
us get a solid lead."
</P>
<P>
The Volunteers took a 63-53 lead as American managed just one
field goal over its next nine possessions. Smith finished with 19
points to lead Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
"Carr plays 40 minutes and Mercer plays 39," Pearl said,
referring to American guard Derrick Mercer. "I think that fatigue
may have been a bit of a factor and we played a lot more guys
than they did."
</P>
<P>
Tennessee shot 48 percent from the floor and managed to get to
the free-throw line more often than American, making 22 of 31
free throws compared with 6 of 12 for the Eagles.
</P>
<P>
Chris Lofton, Tennessee's leading scorer (16.1 points), was only
1 of 7 from the field.
</P>
<P>
American played without Bryce Simon, a starting forward, who tore
a knee ligament last week in the Patriot League tournament. Simon
was averaging 7.2 points.
</P>
<P>
Pearl came to his postgame television interview on the floor
still wiping the sweat from his brow. Most expected his team to
have an easy time of it. Tennessee won the Southeastern
Conference regular-season championship and was briefly ranked No.
1.
</P>
<P>
Now, there is some question how fit the Volunteers will be Sunday
against seventh-seeded Butler, which defeated South Alabama,
81-61.
</P>
<P>
Pearl, who shuffled his starting lineup for Friday's game, did
not show any discouragement afterward.
</P>
<P>
"This is the NCAA tournament," Pearl said, "and no matter how we
try and prepare you guys to understand that this is what it is,
this is what you get, you just think that we're supposed to roll
out there and knock these guys off and in a huge way."
