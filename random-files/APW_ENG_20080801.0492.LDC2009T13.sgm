Malaysia to set retail gasoline price once a month

KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia 2008-08-01 11:00:29 UTC

Malaysia's government will set a new retail price for gasoline
once a month starting Sept. 1, the prime minister said Friday, in
an apparent bid to curb public frustrations over soaring
inflation.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi said in a statement that the
figure will be calculated based on the average international
price for a barrel of crude oil each month. He did not elaborate
on what pricing system or exchange would be used to calculate the
crude price.
</P>
<P>
The government will provide a public subsidy of 30 sen (9 cents)
per liter of gasoline to keep the retail price lower than the
market rate, Abdullah also said. He added that the pump price
would not exceed the current 2.70 ringgit (US$0.83) per liter for
the rest of this year.
</P>
<P>
The new mechanism comes after the government hiked gasoline
prices by 41 percent in June to curb a runaway subsidy bill. The
increase caused year-on-year inflation to spiral to 7.7 percent
that month -- the steepest rate in more than 27 years.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah noted that crude oil prices have shown a recent
"downward trend," indicating that the government expects to lower
retail gasoline prices by next month.
</P>
<P>
Subsidies have kept the price of fuel in Malaysia -- a net
exporter of oil -- among the lowest in Southeast Asia. But the
government has said it cannot afford to fund overly high
subsidies.
