Football: Skoko granted Wigan work permit
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Australia midfielder Josip Skoko has been given the green light
to continue playing for Wigan after being handed a new work
permit.
</P>
<P>
Skoko, 31, had agreed a new contract with the Premiership club
during the close season but was unable to play until his work
permit was ratified by the British Home Office.
</P>
<P>
The former Hajduk Split star had a successful hearing on
Wednesday and he can now resume training with the Latics as they
build-up to the start of the Premiership campaign on August 11.
</P>
<P>
Wigan boss Chris Hutchings was relieved to get the matter
resolved and told the club's website: "This is great news for us.
It feels like another new signing.
</P>
<P>
"I thought Skoks was excellent for us last season and just got
better with every game.
</P>
<P>
"Josip is an intelligent footballer with a real maturity and
presence on the field. I have no doubt with another year of
Premiership experience under his belt he will be even better."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Hutchings has revealed England Under-21 left-back
Leighton Baines will not be joining Sunderland.
</P>
<P>
Baines had talked with Black Cats manager Roy Keane but has not
agreed to a move, fuelling speculation that he could make a six
million pounds switch to Everton instead.
</P>
<P>
Hutchings added: "Leighton is a first-class pro and a first-class
person and despite all the speculation and rumour surrounding his
future, he has remained professional throughout and as ever is a
joy to work with."
