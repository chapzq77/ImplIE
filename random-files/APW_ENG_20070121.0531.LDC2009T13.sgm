Former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday passionately
called on the world to stop Iran's nuclear ambitions in its
tracks by imposing sanctions on the Tehran regime.
</P>
<P>
"I want to call on the world that didn't stop the Holocaust last
time to stop any attempt this time and what needs to be done is
divest genocide," he said in an address to the Herzliya
conference, a yearly get-together of Israel's political and
security elite.

<P>
Iran says its nuclear program is aimed only at producing energy,
but it is widely believed by the West to be developing nuclear
weapons.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu, Israel's current opposition leader, said "voluntary
sanctions" could be initiated separately from the U.N. measures
against Iran and prove more effective, citing the example of how
apartheid South Africa was isolated.
</P>
<P>
"The moment the snowball of voluntary sanctions begins, the
pressure on Iran will be immense," he added.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu has been the leading voice in Israel for taking an
aggressive stance against Iran, often comparing the current era
of world silence toward Iran to that toward pre-World War II Nazi
Germany.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Netanyahu said Israel could not afford to take a back
seat in the attempt to isolate Iran.
</P>
<P>
"When we are talking about rallying public opinion on genocide,
who will lead the charge if not us?" he said. "No one will come
defend the Jews if they no not defend themselves. This is the
lesson of history."
