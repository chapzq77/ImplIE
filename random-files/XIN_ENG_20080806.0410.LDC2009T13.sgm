The International Olympic Committee (IOC)will wait until the last
minute to allow for a joint march of the DPR Korea and South
Korea Friday at the opening ceremony of the Beijing Games.

The Democratic People's Republic of Korea and South Korea marched
together in the 2000 and 2004 Olympics, but there is no official
word on whether they will have a joint march again in Beijing.

When asked if there is a deadline set for the DPRK and South

director Gilbert Felli said: "For me at the last minute."
