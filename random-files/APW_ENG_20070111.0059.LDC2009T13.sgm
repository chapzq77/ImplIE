Keith Richards, who inspired Johnny Depp's natty-haired pirate in
"Pirates of the Caribbean," will both have a role in the film's
third installment.
</P>
<P>
"Pirates" producer Jerry Bruckheimer announced Tuesday at the
Consumer Electronics show in Las Vegas that Richards will appear
in the upcoming sequel "Pirates of the Caribbean: At the World's
End," reports the trade paper Daily Variety.

<P>
The announcement ends years of rumors about the Rolling Stones
guitarist's potential involvement in the popular swashbuckling
franchise.
</P>
<P>
Depp once told The Associated Press his portrayal of loopy pirate
Jack Sparrow in 2003's mega hit "Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead
Man's Chest" and last year's "Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse
of the Black Pearl" is based on a "part rock-star, Keith
Richards-kind-of-guy."
</P>
<P>
Richards has long been known for his hard partying ways and wild,
beaded hair.
</P>
<P>
No other details about his film character were announced.
</P>
<P>
A call on Wednesday to Rolling Stones publicist Fran Curtis was
not immediately returned.
