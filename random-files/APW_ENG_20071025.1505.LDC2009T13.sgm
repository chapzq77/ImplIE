Former New York city police commissioner ' s case could hurt
Giuliani ' s final push for US votes

WASHINGTON 2007-10-25 20:23:22 UTC
</P>
<P>
The criminal investigation of New York's former police
commissioner is on track to crash headlong into the Republican
presidential race -- and Rudy Giuliani's final push for the
nomination.
</P>
<P>
Since former Mayor Giuliani began campaigning, he has sought to
distance himself from Bernard Kerik and to blunt the political
fallout from his relationship with his ex-police commissioner,
business partner and close friend.
</P>
<P>
Giuliani has accepted responsibility for his role in Kerik's
embarrassing 2004 withdrawal as President Bush's Homeland
Security nominee amid tax problems. Ethics questions and
corruption allegations also have swirled around Kerik.
</P>
<P>
"I made a mistake in recommending Bernie Kerik to the president,"
Giuliani says often, adding that he should have more thoroughly
vetted his associate of nearly two decades.
</P>
<P>
Such acknowledgments may not be enough for Giuliani to emerge
politically unscathed as prosecutors wrap up their investigation
of Kerik on multiple federal felony charges. Kerik is expected to
confront the results of the investigation as early as next month
-- and it is widely believed he will either be indicted or reach
a plea agreement with prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
Should prosecutors charge Kerik and the case reach trial,
Giuliani could end up being called to testify during the general
election campaign. Should Kerik agree to a plea deal, he could be
admitting guilt on some level for activities that may have taken
place while the city employed him -- and on Giuliani's watch.
</P>
<P>
At the very least, the case will be in the headlines again,
especially if soon-to-be-confirmed Attorney General Michael
Mukasey, another Giuliani friend, recuses himself from any
Justice Department prosecution of Kerik.
</P>
<P>
Giuliani aides play down any political implications, but they
acknowledge that Kerik's woes could be a distraction during a
period in which they want their candidate promoting his vision
for the United States.
</P>
<P>
"It will matter significantly if his opponents bring it up," said
Robert Y. Shapiro, a Columbia University political science
professor. "And, they very well might, especially if he's the
front-runner."
</P>
<P>
If Giuliani wins the nomination, Shapiro said, "the Democrats
will make this an issue. You can count on that."
</P>
<P>
So far, Kerik's troubles have not seemed to nick Giuliani's
primary campaign narrative that he is a Republican who tamed a
Democratic city and heroically led New York after the Sept. 11,
2001, terrorist attacks.
</P>
<P>
Giuliani leads other Republicans in national polls and is
competing strongly in early presidential preference voting
states. Rivals have stepped up criticism of him lately, and
Kerik's case would give them more fodder.
</P>
<P>
Opponents Mitt Romney, Fred Thompson, John McCain or Mike
Huckabee could use Kerik to try to define Giuliani as somebody
who lacks good judgment and surrounds himself with unsavory
people.
</P>
<P>
"This speaks to issues of ethics and corruption. It speaks to
capability and leadership," Shapiro said. "Giuliani plays up his
leadership as New York City mayor, and Kerik was a part of that."
