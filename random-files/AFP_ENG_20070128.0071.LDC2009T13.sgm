A high-ranking US Treasury official is due to arrive in Beijing
Sunday for talks with North Korean envoys on US financial
sanctions which Pyongyang says stand in the way of an agreement
on halting its nuclear arms program, an embassy spokesperson
said.
</P>
<P>
Daniel Glaser, deputy assistant secretary for terrorist financing
and financial crimes, will hold talks with North Korean officials
in the Chinese capital Tuesday, the spokesperson told AFP.
</P>
<P>
Talks last occurred between the two parties in December in
Beijing, but ended in diplomatic deadlock.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say a resolution of the financial sanctions is critical
to ending the broader problem of Pyongyang's nuclear drive, under
discussion in parallel talks involving the United States, Russia,
China, Japan and the two Koreas.
</P>
<P>
After long negotiations, North Korea agreed in a September 2005
pact to dismantle its nuclear program in return for diplomatic
recognition and food and energy aid.
</P>
<P>
But the pact was never implemented because of Pyongyang's
protests over financial sanctions Washington imposed on Macau-
based Banco Delta Asia the same month.
</P>
<P>
The United States claimed the bank served as key conduit for
North Korean counterfeiting and money laundering. Pyongyang has
denied Washington's allegations.
</P>
<P>
Talks on dismantling North Korea's nuclear program attained new
urgency in October when it tested an atomic bomb for the first
time.
