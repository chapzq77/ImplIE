Pressure on Japanese defence minister eases
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Japan's opposition is quietly stepping back from calls on the
defence chief to step down over a naval accident that killed two
fishermen, whose colleagues Thursday lent support to the
minister.
</P>
<P>
Japan's largest and newest destroyer, equipped with the advanced
Aegis radar combat system, rammed the fishing boat in the Pacific
Ocean.
</P>
<P>
Two fishermen, a father and his adult son, are presumed dead in
the collision last month, which has led to a fall in the support
ratings for Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda's government.
</P>
<P>
The opposition last week demanded fresh elections and pledged to
stall proceedings unless Defence Minister Shigeru Ishiba quit or
was fired in what would be the first departure from Fukuda's
five-month-old government.
</P>
<P>
While publicly the opposition has not changed stance, its calls
for Ishiba's head have cooled this week, which media reports
attributed to a request from the victims' family.
</P>
<P>
"The local fishermen's union has been consistently saying that
Minister Ishiba wouldn't be able to take responsibility just by
resigning the position," a fisherman in the victims' village of
Katsuura told AFP.
</P>
<P>
"He has to take responsibility by clarifying what caused the
accident and taking thorough preventive measures," he said,
declining to be named.
</P>
<P>
Fukuda and Ishiba both visited the village, with the premier
offering a tearful apology to Sachiko Kichisei, whose husband and
son are both presumed dead.
</P>
<P>
Fukuda received a letter from the family, which media reports
said asked him to spare Ishiba.
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what exactly the letter said, but I'm sure it was
along the lines of the feelings that we all share," the fisherman
said.
</P>
<P>
Until last week, Japanese news reports had been filled with
anonymous quotes from ruling party lawmakers saying it was only a
matter of time before Ishiba would be forced out.
</P>
<P>
But on Wednesday the Yomiuri Shimbun daily quoted a senior
official of the main opposition Democratic Party saying: "We
won't be able to get public support for demanding him to resign
under the current circumstances."
</P>
<P>
The opposition took control of the upper house last year and has
repeatedly seized on scandals to demand fresh general elections.
