HANOI, Vietnam 2007-06-12 06:00:35 UTC

<P>
Vietnam's first bird flu patient in 18 months has fully
recovered, but more outbreaks among poultry are likely
nationwide, officials and state-controlled media reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The 30-year-old man from northern Vinh Phuc province was
discharged from Bach Mai hospital Monday where he had been
treated for nearly a month, said hospital director Tran Thuy
Hanh.
</P>
<P>
A second bird flu victim who was hospitalized in late May is
still being treated at the Hospital of Tropical Diseases.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture Minister Cao Duc Phat warned that more outbreaks
could occur among poultry. Sixteen provinces have been hit since
early May, killing or forcing the slaughter of more than 100,000
birds, Tuesday's Saigon Giai Phong (Liberated Saigon) newspaper
reported.
</P>
<P>
Phat blamed the latest outbreaks on virus-carrying waterfowl and
the local authorities' failure to fight it aggressively, it said.
</P>
<P>
Bird flu has killed at least 190 people since it began ravaging
Asian poultry stocks in 2003, 42 of them in Vietnam, according to
the World Health Organization.
</P>
<P>
The virus remains difficult for people to catch, but experts fear
it could eventually mutate to a form that spreads more easily
between humans, sparking a global pandemic that could kill
millions.
