The Arab League is in dire financial straits because most of its
22 member states haven't paid all their annual contributions,
said an internal report obtained by The Associated Press on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The League will hold its yearly summit this weekend in Damascus,
and has listed a review of the financial situation high on its
agenda, along with the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, Lebanon's
presidential election standoff and the Iraqi crisis.
</P>
<P>
According to the report prepared by Secretary General Amr Moussa,
the League faces a US$22 million (euro13.94 million) deficit, or
about 60 percent of its annual budget.
</P>
<P>
Member states have paid only 86 percent of their contributions
due for 2006 and 2007, said the report, stating that members owed
US$88 million (euro55.75 million) in contribution arrears.
</P>
<P>
The League's annual budget runs at about US$36 million, with most
of the contributions coming from oil-rich countries likes Saudi
Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.
</P>
<P>
But the report showed that some wealthy Gulf countries such as
Qatar and Kuwait have reservations on their share of the budget
--despite a boom in oil prices that has generated billions of
dollars of additional revenues-- while poor nations like Somalia
and Djibouti can't afford to pay their due.
