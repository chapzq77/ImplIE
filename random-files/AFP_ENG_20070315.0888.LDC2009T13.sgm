Bombardier apologises for plane incident in Japan
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Canadian company Bombardier apologised Friday after one of its
passenger jets operated by a Japanese carrier failed to lower its
front wheels, forcing the plane to make a dramatic belly-landing.
</P>
<P>
Company vice president Todd Young held talks at Japan's transport
ministry to discuss this week's incident, which was caught on
television and led to a nationwide investigation of Bombardier
planes.
</P>
<P>
"Let me send our sincere regrets and apologies to all concerned,"
Young later told reporters, offering a Japanese-style bow.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, a Bombardier DHC-8 run by All Nippon Airways had to
circle the skies above a regional airport to try various ways to
get its front wheel down. It finally landed with only its rear
wheels deplyoed, with the nose skidding on the runway.
</P>
<P>
None of the 60 people on board were injured.
</P>
<P>
The transport ministry immediately ordered checks on the landing
gear of all 36 Bombardier DHC-8 planes in operation in Japan
before they can fly again.
</P>
<P>
All Nippon Airways indefinitely suspended flights using its 13
DHC-8 planes.
</P>
<P>
Young was also due to visit Kochi airport in southwestern Japan
where the incident took place.
