Macedonia urges troika to consult it on Kosovo
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Macedonian President Branko Crvenkovski on Thursday called on the
international community to consult his country about the future
status of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"Macedonia will launch an initiative to the US, EU and Russia to
organise a meeting with representatives of this region including
Macedonia," Crvenkovski said after a meeting of Macedonia's
security council dedicated to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
He stressed, however, that "at this moment, there are no
indications of any serious threats to the security of Macedonia."
</P>
<P>
An international troika -- composed of representatives of the
United States, the European Union and Russia -- has launched a
new round of negotiations on the final status of the UN-run
Serbian province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Its 90-percent ethnic Albanian population wants independence, an
option staunchly opposed by Serbia.
</P>
<P>
Some observers in Macedonia fear that granting Kosovo
independence will lead to tensions in the former Yugoslav
republic, which itself has a 25-percent ethnic Albanian
population.
