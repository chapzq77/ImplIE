Darren Clarke sank a huge birdie putt on the final hole to win
the BMW Asian Open here on Sunday for a highly emotional victory
that he dedicated to his sons following the death of their
mother.The Northern Irishman pumped both fists into the air in
triumph and embraced his caddie after his putt of around 30 feet
on the 18th hole gave him a one shot victory over playing partner
Robert-Jan Derksen of the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
It was Clarke's first tournament win since his wife, Heather,
died of cancer in August 2006.
</P>
<P>
"It was always going to be a difficult hurdle for me to get back
into the winner's enclosure after Heather passed away... It's a
big mental hurdle that I have crossed today," the 39-year-old
said.
</P>
<P>
Clarke carded a one-over 73 to finish the tournament at eight
under, while Derksen also shot a 73 following a dramatic final
few holes in which the Ulsterman gave up a two-stroke cushion as
his thoughts drifted to his family.
</P>
<P>
Italian Francesco Molinari, Taiwan's Lin Wen-tang and English
rookie Robert Dinwiddie were tied for third place at five under
in the 2.3-million-dollar tournament, which is co-sanctioned by
the European and Asian tours..
</P>
<P>
Sweden's world number 13, the highest ranked player in the
tournament, finished in outright sixth place at four under after
a strong final round of 68.
</P>
<P>
Clarke's victory, which earned him 383,000 dollars, was his first
win on the European Tour since 2003 and his 11th in total.
</P>
<P>
He said it was the most important victory of his career as it
cemented his golfing comeback following his wife's death.
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes there's a black hole. It's not easy to see through,"
Clarke said as he spoke of the deep emotional turmoil he has
endured since his wife died.
</P>
<P>
In that respect, Clarke dedicated his victory to his sons, aged
nine and seven.
</P>
<P>
"This win is for Tyrone and Conor," he said, while also thanking
all his friends who had supported him over the past 20 months.
</P>
<P>
Clarke, who for many years had been a mainstay in Europe's Ryder
Cup team, had watched his world ranking plummet out of the top 50
to 236 at the start of the BMW Asian Open.
</P>
<P>
He said his win on Sunday was the result of practising 10-12
hours a day.
</P>
<P>
"I've been working harder than I've ever worked on all aspects of
my game. It's nice to see it pay off," he said.
</P>
<P>
Clarke, the overnight leader, looked to be cruising to victory
when he established a two-shot buffer over Derksen at the par
three 14th hole after the Dutchman chipped into the water on his
way to a double bogey.
</P>
<P>
However Clarke missed a par putt of less than two feet on the
16th, then bogeyed the 17th after driving into the trees to allow
Derksen a share of the lead.
</P>
<P>
"From the the 14th onwards. I lost my concentration. I started
thinking about Heather and the boys and bits and pieces," Clarke
said.
</P>
<P>
"In this game, unless you keep your concentration for the whole
way around, you make mistakes and that's what I did."
</P>
<P>
On the 18th, Derksen chipped his third shot to within two feet to
be almost assured of a par. That left Clarke with his putt of
nearly 30 feet to win the tournament or face going into a playoff
with Derksen.
</P>
<P>
"On the last green I gathered myself and said: 'Right, hit a good
putt'. Luckily I did," a beaming Clarke said.
</P>
<P>
Derksen paid tribute to Clarke afterwards.
</P>
<P>
"Darren doled a good putt and that's his day," said Derksen, who
was bidding for his third win on the European Tour.
</P>
<P>
"It was a great match... He's a great winner."
</P>
<P>
Clarke said he would now strive to return to the world's top 50
and get his place back in Europe's Ryder Cup team.
