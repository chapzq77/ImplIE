Football: Martins says sorry for Nigeria no-show
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Newcastle striker Obafemi Martins on Tuesday apologised for
refusing to play for Nigeria in last week's friendly against
Ghana.
</P>
<P>
Martins, who missed the 4-1 defeat to tend to his sick mother,
told BBC Sport: "I apologise to the Nigeria Football Association
(NFA) and the players because it was a very important game. But I
also believe my mum was more important."
</P>
<P>
The NFA were angered by the player's absence, describing him as
unpatriotic and referred the case to their disciplinary
committee.
</P>
<P>
Martins says despite this row he will be available to play for
his country in the future.
</P>
<P>
"When I am called upon I will play for them, because you have to
respect the national team.
</P>
<P>
"I do respect the Super Eagles a lot, so anytime they call I will
come and play."
