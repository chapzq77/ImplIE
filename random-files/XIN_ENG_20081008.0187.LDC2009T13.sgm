WASHINGTON, Oct. 8 (Xinhua)
</P>
<P>
Representatives from the United States, China, Russia, Britain,
France and Germany will soon discuss the settlement of Iran's
nuclear issue via telephone, a U. S. official said here
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Officials of the six countries will consult possible action by
the United Nations Security Council to stop Iran's sensitive
nuclear work, said the official who asked not to be identified.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Undersecretary of State William Burns and his colleagues
will discuss "next steps in the UN Security Council," the
official said.
</P>
<P>
Senior officials from the six countries discussed in mid-
September over possible new sanctions against Iran as Tehran
refuses to comply with United Nations resolutions.
</P>
<P>
The United States and its European allies have been trying to
push the United Nations to impose the fourth sanctions against
Iran in a bid to force Tehran to give up its nuclear program.
</P>
<P>
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said in its
September report that due to Tehran's block, the UN nuclear
watchdog had been unable to make much progress in investigating
Iran's suspect nuclear program.
</P>
<P>
The United States and its allies have accused Iran of developing
nuclear weapons, but Iran insists that its nuclear program is
only for peaceful purposes.
</P>
<P>
Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad shrugged off international
sanctions threat, saying "Sanctions are not important," and "The
era of such threats has ended."
