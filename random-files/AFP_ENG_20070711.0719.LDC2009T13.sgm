Golf: Cabrera dreaming of Open double by by Angus MacKinnon

US Open champion Angel Cabrera believes the boost he received
from last month's unexpected triumph at Oakmont can carry him all
the way to a second major title at next week's British Open.
</P>
<P>
The powerful Argentinian, nick-named 'the duck' because of his
waddling gait, admits that the lay-out of Carnoustie, the
Scottish links that will host the 136th Open Championship from
July 19-22, is not as well-suited to his game as some of the
other venues for the oldest major.
</P>
<P>
But that consideration, he feels, is more than offset by the
psychological breakthrough he achieved in holding off the final-
day challenge of Tiger Woods to become the US Open's first
Argentinian winner.
</P>
<P>
"Mentally it gives me a lot of confidence," Cabrera reflected
ahead of this week's Scottish Open, where his compatriot and
mentor Eduardo Romero triumphed in 2002.
</P>
<P>
"I know now that I can beat the best players in the world and
that I can win major championships.
</P>
<P>
"I feel that I could win the Open on certain golf courses and I
think I have a chance to win at Carnoustie.
</P>
<P>
"That said, the course doesn't really favour me. It's tough and
if you play badly you're going to shoot over par, and the weather
conditions are going to be a factor."
</P>
<P>
Along with the enhanced belief, Romero admits he has had to deal
with the enhanced expectations that go along with his new-found
status.
</P>
<P>
"It is a little bit hard but that is what comes with winning a
major," he said. "You have to deal with the pressure of the
public, the crowds, the press and everybody."
</P>
<P>
Among those who have been keen to bask in some of the glory
reflected from Cabrera's achievement is Argentina's President,
Nestor Kirchner, who has invited the former caddie from Cordoba
for dinner at his presidential residence.
</P>
<P>
"I've had so many invitations but I've not been able to go to all
of them because of my tight schedule," Cabrera revealed. "But I
will meet the President for dinner when I get back."
</P>
<P>
When the Open was last played at Carnoustie, in 1999, the course
was famously dubbed Car-nasty by some of the disgruntled players
who found the thick rough virtually impossible to deal with.
</P>
<P>
More than half the field ran up at least one round of 80 or
higher and unheralded Scot Paul Lawrie finally came through the
field to win the tournament with a six-over par four-round total.
</P>
<P>
Organisers have attempted to create a fairer test this year with
the rough cut back significantly and some subtle changes
introduced to take some of the sting out of the holes that caused
most problems last time around.
</P>
<P>
"It looks like they are going to let the weather dictate scoring
this year rather than how it was in 1999," said US-based English
star Luke Donald, who missed the cut that year in what was his
major tournament debut.
</P>
<P>
"On the (par five) sixth the lay-up area was squeezed into 12-15
yards max and remember you are hitting drive and a two iron to
lay up where you would be hitting a six or seven iron for your
third shot," he recalled. "I think a few holes were definitely a
little bit narrower."
</P>
<P>
That view was confirmed by Northern Ireland's Darren Clarke, who
got an early practice round in last Sunday before heading for
Loch Lomond.
</P>
<P>
"The course is in magnificent shape," he reported. "It is nothing
like the course we played the last time the Open was there. We've
got a chance of finding our ball if it goes in the rough. If
there is a bit of wind it is going to play tough, but it's going
to play fair."
