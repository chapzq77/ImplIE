EU to propose deep cuts in new car emissions
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The European Commission was to present plans Wednesday to limit
CO2 emissions from new cars after weeks of delays due to
divisions over how much the car industry should sacrifice for
cleaner air.
</P>
<P>
After struggling to reach a compromise, a consensus has emerged
in the European Union's executive arm for a proposal to require
new cars' average carbon dioxide emissions to be reduced to 120
grammes per kilometre by 2012.
</P>
<P>
New passenger cars currently emit about 160 grammes of CO2 per
kilometre.
</P>
<P>
Under the proposal, auto makers would be required to limit
average emissions across their fleet to 130 grammes per kilometer
by improving the technology they use.
</P>
<P>
A further 10 grammes would be cut through requirements on tyre,
equipment and fuel makers to improve air-conditioning efficiency,
tyre pressure monitoring and gear shift indicators while
increasing the use of biofuels and other measures.
</P>
<P>
With car makers failing to meet existing voluntary targets, the
commission was in agreement that binding limits were needed, but
Environment Commissioner Stavros Dimas and Industry Commissioner
Guenter Verheugen were divided over how much an effort should
come from car makers.
</P>
<P>
Dimas sought a tough binding limit of 120 grammes for car makers
while Verheugen wanted measures to be shared with tyre, equipment
and fuel makers, easing the burden on the automobile industry,
which he says employs 12 million people directly or indirectly in
Europe.
</P>
<P>
The compromise proposal is to be officially presented after its
adoption by other commissioners. The commission is aiming to
present by the end of the year formal legislation that will then
have to be approved by EU governments and the European
Parliament.
</P>
<P>
The European car industry is up in arms about the proposals,
which it says could force them to relocate production elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
"Putting the burden of reducing CO2 emissions mainly on the
shoulders of the car industry means choosing the most expensive
and least cost-effective strategy for society," the ACEA European
car industry association said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"It will lead to a loss of jobs and a relocation of production
outside Europe," it added.
</P>
<P>
European, Japanese and Korean manufacturers have failed to meet a
voluntary target to cut average emissions for new cars sold in
Europe by 25 percent from 1995 levels.
</P>
<P>
The commission says they have so far only decreased emissions by
12.4 percent, which the EU executive describes as "not
satisfactory."
</P>
<P>
Road transport pollution has risen 30 percent since 1990 and now
makes up more than a quarter of the EU's carbon dioxide
emissions, with half of that  from passenger cars.
</P>
<P>
The commission's hesitation to bring forward plans on car
emissions cast a shadow over a recent drive to fight climate
change, which was one of the main planks of a wide-ranging energy
action plan it unveiled last month.
</P>
<P>
"Just a month ago, the EU unveiled its new energy strategy to
great fanfare, with claims that the EU was going to play a real
global leadership role -- and yet here we see it falling at the
first hurdle, failing at the first test," said Green euro-deputy
Caroline Lucas.
