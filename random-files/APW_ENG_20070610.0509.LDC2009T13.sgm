Police have arrested two men for the murder in April of two
elderly nuns in a convent in southern Greece, authorities said
Sunday.

The men -- a Greek and a Macedonian national -- confessed to the
killing after their arrest late Friday, police said.

The nuns were strangled during an overnight robbery at the
Artokostas Convent, on a rocky hillside near the town of Astros,
about 130 kilometers (80 miles) southwest of Athens. Police are
looking for a third man, also Macedonian

Many Greek convents and monasteries contain valuable icons and
are often poorly guarded.

Last year, a 700-year-old icon was stolen from a monastery near
Leonidio, a town in the same region of Peloponnese.
