Ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) presidential candidate
Frank Hsieh, who has been out of public view for several days,
will resume his election campaign schedule as soon as the DPP
chairmanship is settled, Hsieh's campaign office spokesman Chao
Tien-lin said Tuesday.

<P>
The DPP chairmanship has remained vacant since Yu Shyi-kun
resigned from the post late last month.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh delivered a speech by video posted on his campaign Web site
Monday in which he explained that he had been ill and needed
rest, Chao said, adding that Hsieh has now fully recovered from a
cold, although a foot injury described as "serious" will take
more to heal.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh said in the video that he was waiting for a full recovery
of his foot and at the same time making use of his convalescence
to ponder the nation's future and the DPP's tangled party
affairs.
</P>
<P>
Chao said Hsieh will also reveal the results of his deliberation
on important national issues once the DPP chairmanship is
decided.
