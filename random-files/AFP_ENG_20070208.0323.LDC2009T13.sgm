Facts about the NATO-led security force in Afghanistan
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The NATO-led International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in
Afghanistan, topping the agenda of a meeting of alliance defence
ministers Thursday, now comprises almost 35,500 troops.
</P>
<P>
More than half of the force, drawn from 37 nations, is made up of
contributions from the United States, with 14,000 troops, and
Britain, which has deployed 5,200 personnel, according to
official figures released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Until NATO took command in 2003, the leadership of ISAF had
rotated among different nations every six months.
</P>
<P>
NATO expanded its operations from Kabul and the relatively quiet
north and west of the conflict-torn country, to the south and
east, where a resurgent Taliban militia has opposed it.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban, ousted from power in late 2001 for harbouring Osama
bin Laden, is expected to mount a new offensive in the south and
east in coming weeks as the weather warms. Its fighters seized
control of one town last week.
</P>
<P>
Britain, along with Canada -- with 2,500 troops -- and the
Netherlands, 2,200, have born the brunt of the fighting in the
Taliban's heartland in the south, and NATO commanders have urged
the allies to inject more resources.
</P>
<P>
On the eve of the NATO meeting in Seville, Germany announced
plans to deploy six reconnaissance jets -- and the 500 personnel
needed to run them -- but it insists they will play no combat
role.
</P>
<P>
Britain also announced that it would have an additional 800
troops in the south of the country by the Afghan summer. Poland
has started deploying around 1,000 troops, which are likely to be
in place by April.
</P>
<P>
NATO's new military chief, US General Bantz Craddock, is likely
to urge the 26 alliance nations to come up with an additional
three battalions, whose size differs from country to country but
should mean about 3,000 personnel.
</P>
<P>
Officials say, though, that no new offers are likely to be made
in Seville.
</P>
<P>
The ISAF operation -- NATO's most ambitious mission ever -- is
aimed at spreading the influence of President Hamid Karzai's weak
central government to the more lawless outlying regions.
</P>
<P>
The way it plays out could determine the future of the 60-year-
old military alliance and whether its vocation involves combat
operations, or more modestly just peacekeeping and
reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
ISAF troop numbers fluctuate constantly as troops are deployed,
rotated, replaced or simply withdrawn from the country.
