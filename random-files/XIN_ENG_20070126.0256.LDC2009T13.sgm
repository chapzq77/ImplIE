1 bln yuan from BOC
</HEADLINE>

BEIJING, Jan. 26 (Xinhua)
</P>
<P>
China's Ministry of Public Security has asked Canada to extradite
a former Bank of China official who allegedly siphoned 1 billion
yuan (128 million U.S. dollars) from customers' accounts to
Canada, the Beijing Daily reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The report said Gao Shan, former head of a branch of the Bank of
China in Harbin, capital of northeast China's Heilongjiang
Province, fled after sending the huge sum to Canada in 2005.
</P>
<P>
Gao Shan and another suspect, Li Dongzhe, are currently under the
surveillance of Canadian police, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted unidentified Canadian sources as saying that
the extradition of the two suspects would not be difficult.
</P>
<P>
Calls to the Canadian Embassy in Beijing were not immediately
returned.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the accountants of Northeast Expressway
Co. Ltd. reported on Jan. 4, 2005, that more than 293 million
yuan had disappeared from the company's account at the Bank of
China.
</P>
<P>
Other customers also reported the disappearance of huge funds
from their BOC accounts. The total sum exceeded 1 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
On Jan. 13, 2005, Zhang Xiaoguang, former chairman of the board
of Northeast Expressway Co. Ltd. was charged with embezzlement of
public funds and is awaiting trial in China.
</P>
<P>
China has been active in seeking international cooperation in its
fight against corruption. Chinese prosecutors have brought about
70 criminal suspects back to China from foreign countries since
1998.
</P>
<P>
The successful extradition from the United States of a Guangdong
Province branch head of the Bank of China in 2004 was lauded as a
powerful deterrent to corruption. Yu Zhendong, the banker, was
convicted of misappropriating 483 million U.S. dollars before
fleeing to the United States.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the Ministry of Public Security said 800 suspects at
large abroad were wanted for economic crimes. They are accused of
embezzling a total sum of almost 70 billion yuan.
