BAGHDAD, Iraq 2007-02-19 13:11:37 UTC
</P>
<P>
A string of bombings killed at least 15 people Monday in the
Baghdad area, a day after a massive car bomb attack in a Shiite
area market delivered the first major blow to the U.S.-led
security crackdown.
</P>
<P>
Attacks in other parts of Iraq pushed the overall death toll to
near 30.
</P>
<P>
U.S. forces also reportedly came under attack. They clashed with
insurgents north of Baghdad after a suicide bomber apparently
tried to break through barriers around a joint U.S.-Iraqi base,
area residents told The Associated Press. U.S. military officials
said they were looking into the incident.
</P>
<P>
The compound was cordoned off by U.S. soldiers. Residents said
the blast from the failed attack may have ignited fuel storage
tanks, but there was no immediate comment from the U.S. military.
Helicopters were seen landing at the base and leaving.
</P>
<P>
In Baghdad, five people were killed when a suicide attacker
donated a bomb-rigged belt on a public bus headed for the mostly
Shiite area of Karradah in central Baghdad, police reported.
</P>
<P>
A roadside bomb killed three policemen in the Shiite area of
Zafraniyah in southeastern Baghdad, officials said. Only 100
meters (yards) away, a bomb hidden in an open-air market
exploded, killing at least five.
</P>
<P>
In Mahmoudiya, 30 kilometers (20 miles) south of the capital, a
car bomb went off among auto repair shops, killing two and
wounding two, police said. Mahmoudiya is mostly Shiite with
Sunnis living in villages around the community and has long been
a flashpoint for sectarian violence.
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere in Iraq, a car bomb in Ramadi, about 150 kilometers (90
miles) west of Baghdad, killed at least nine bystanders
congregated at a police checkpoint in the aftermath of a failed
suicide attack.
</P>
<P>
In Duluiyah, a Sunni area about 75 kilometers (45 miles) north of
Baghdad, at least four were killed when a bomb-rigged car
exploded.
</P>
<P>
Police said at least 62 people died Sunday in the attack in the
mostly Shiite area of New Baghdad. Scores were injured as
extremists sent a bloody calling card to officials boasting that
militant factions were on the run.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. military announced Monday that a U.S. Marine was killed
two days earlier during combat operations in Anbar province, a
Sunni insurgent hotspot west of the capital.
</P>
<P>
The latest attacks were a sobering reminder of the huge
challenges confronting any effort to rattle the well-armed and
well-hidden insurgents.
</P>
<P>
Just a few hours before the weekend blasts, Lt. Gen. Abboud
Qanbar led reporters on a tour of the neighborhood near the
marketplace and promised to "chase the terrorists out of
Baghdad." On Saturday, the Iraqi spokesman for the plan, Brig.
Gen. Qassim Moussawi, said violence had plummeted 80 percent in
the capital.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 130 people were injured. Another person was killed in a
car bombing Sunday in the Shiite militia stronghold of Sadr City.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki condemned the bombing as a
desperate act by "terrorists" and "criminals" who sense they are
being squeezed.
</P>
<P>
"These crimes confirm the defeat of these perpetrators and their
failure in confronting our armed forces, which are determined to
cleanse the dens of terrorism," al-Maliki said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Ambassador Zalmay Khalilzad said the bombings underscore the
"increasing desperation felt by criminals" and would only serve
to "galvanize Iraqi forces and their coalition partners."
</P>
<P>
Sunday was by far the deadliest day since the security sweeps
began last week. On Thursday, a string of car bombs killed seven
civilians on the first full day of the house-to-house searches
for weapons and suspected militants.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-led teams have faced limited direct defiance as they set
up checkpoints and comb neighborhoods. But that could change as
they move into more volatile sections. The next could be Sadr
City, a stronghold of the Mahdi Army militia loyal to radical
Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr.
</P>
<P>
U.S. soldiers pressed closer to Sadr City and the reception
changed noticeably. In previous days, Shiite families opened
their doors to welcome the troops -- feeling that the American
presence would be a buffer against feared attacks from Sunni
militia.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, in areas closer to Sadr City, parents slapped away the
candy and lollipops given by American soldiers.
</P>
<P>
"The Baghdad security plan is very important to push Iraq ahead,"
said Haider al-Obeidi, a parliament member from the Dawa party of
the prime minister al-Maliki.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, borders with Iran and Syria -- shut for three days as
the plan got under way -- reopened Sunday. But new and strict
rules will apply.
</P>
<P>
Moussawi was quoted in the Azzaman newspaper as saying the
crossing points to the two nations would be open for only several
hours a day and under "intense observation."
</P>
<P>
The United States and allies claim Iraqi militants receive aid
and supplies from Iran, including parts for lethal roadside bombs
targeting U.S. forces. Iran denies any role in trafficking
weapons.
</P>
<P>
In Buhriz, a Sunni-dominated town about 60 kilometers (35 miles)
north of Baghdad, U.S. and Iraqi soldiers kicked in doors and
scoured homes, but most dwellings were eerily empty.
</P>
<P>
Soldiers confiscated new Iraqi army uniforms in a building not
known to house troops, along with a rocket-propelled grenade
launcher and AK-47 magazines. There has been growing suspicion
that militants have posed as Iraqi soldiers in some attacks and
ambushes.
</P>
<P>
In another house, medical supplies were scattered about -- saline
bottles, IV bags, syringes -- in what soldiers believe was a
makeshift aid station for insurgents.
