Wiesel attacked in San Francisco: report
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Elie Wiesel, the renowned Holocaust author and Nobel Peace Prize
winner, was attacked and dragged out of a San Francisco hotel
elevator last week, The San Francisco Chronicle reported on its
website Friday.
</P>
<P>
Citing police officials, the newspaper said Wiesel was possibly
assaulted by a Holocaust denier who claims to have stalked him
for weeks.
</P>
<P>
Wiesel, 78, was at the Argent Hotel on February 1 for an
interfaith conference when he was confronted around 6:30 pm in an
elevator by a man insisting that he wanted to interview the
author, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Wiesel said he would do the interview in the lobby of the Third
Street hotel, but the man insisted on going to Wiesel's room,
said the paper.
</P>
<P>
The man then stopped the elevator at the sixth floor, dragged
Wiesel out and tried to force him into a room on that floor, The
Chronicle reported.
</P>
<P>
"That's when (Wiesel) started yelling," the paper quotes police
Sergeant Neville Gittens as saying.
</P>
<P>
The man fled, and Wiesel, who was not injured, went down to the
lobby and called police.
</P>
<P>
Wiesel decided to leave the conference on "Facing Violence:
Justice, Religion and Conflict Resolution," and police escorted
him to the airport, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, a man identifying himself Eric Hunt and claiming to
be the attacker posted an account of the incident on a virulently
anti-Semitic and anti-Israel website, The Chronicle said.
</P>
<P>
The account matches the description of the attack that police
later released, according to the newspaper.
