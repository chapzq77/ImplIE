GERMAN VOTE CONFIRMS LEFTWARD SHIFT OF POLITICAL CENTER
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FRANKFURT, Germany
</P>
<P>
The successor to the East German Communist Party won
representation in the legislature of the northern city of Hamburg
on Sunday, confirming a leftward political shift across Germany.
</P>
<P>
The results, after a similar outcome in two state elections in
January, come amid an increasingly sharp conflict in Germany
about whether the former Communists, known as the Left Party,
would be a viable political partner in Hamburg and elsewhere in
Germany.
</P>
<P>
That dispute, in turn, is worsening already fractious relations
between the two large parties of Chancellor Angela Merkel's
coalition government in Berlin.
</P>
<P>
Though a tiny slice of the German political landscape, Hamburg
has in the past few weeks taken on an outsized importance as a
test case for whether Germans, weary of years of belt-tightening
economic restructuring, would drive the political center of
gravity further left.
</P>
<P>
The vote on Sunday confirmed the trend, with the Left Party
winning 6.5 percent of the vote, according to German public
television's preliminary exit polls.
</P>
<P>
The city's popular mayor, Ole von Beust of the conservative
Christian Democratic Union, won 42.7 percent, stripping him of
the absolute majority he has used to govern for the last four
years. The Social Democrats, the pillar of Germany's center-left,
won 34.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Left Party, a combination of former Communists, disillusioned
Social Democrats and western radicals, won enough votes last
month in the states of Hesse and Lower Saxony to win
parliamentary representation. While the Left Party is well
represented in the east and has parliamentary seats in the
northern city-state of Bremen, it had never sat in one of the
large western states' parliaments.
</P>
<P>
The votes contributed to a brewing sense of political
helplessness.
</P>
<P>
"The German political system is now effectively in gridlock,"
said Jackson Janes, director of the American Institute for
Contemporary German Studies, a research group based in
Washington. "And no one knows how to get it out."
</P>
<P>
After last month's votes, Kurt Beck, the national chairman of the
Social Democrats, spoke out against "any kind of active
cooperation" with the Left, a formulation that only fueled
speculation that his party might try to form a minority
government with the Left's support.
</P>
<P>
The Left is still viewed with great suspicion by many Germans
because of its Communist past. At the state level, it currently
governs only in Berlin, which is also a state, and it has never
played a national role.
