CARACAS, Nov. 23 (Xinhua)

<P>
Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez said on Sunday he was satisfied
with the massive participation of his compatriots in the
municipal and regional elections.
</P>
<P>
Chavez called on the electors to stay calm and trust the results
to be announced by the Electoral National Council.
</P>
<P>
"It is impossible to make a fraud in Venezuela," Chavez said,
adding that the transparency of the electoral system of the
country has been verified by domestic and foreign experts.
</P>
<P>
Chavez cast his ballot at the technical school "Manuel Palacio
Fajardo," where he showed his ID card and put his thumb on the
fingertip scanner for identity verification.
</P>
<P>
He said the Venezuelan electoral system is totally automatic and
one of the most secure and fastest in the world.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, almost 17 million Venezuelans were registered to pick
out 22 governors, 328 mayors and 233 local legislators, while
about 130 foreign observers monitored the process.
</P>
<P>
The election results will also be an indicator of Chavez's
popularity. Chavez tries to convince the electors to support a
constitutional reform to allow him to be re-elected in 2012.
