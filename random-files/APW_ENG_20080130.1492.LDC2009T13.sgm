US auto industry expects weak January sales as a tough year
begins

The year automakers have been dreading has begun.
</P>
<P>
Analysts forecast U.S. sales could fall by as many as 1 million
vehicles in January compared to the same month last year, bearing
out predictions that 2008 could be the worst year for automakers
in more than a decade. Automakers report January sales on Friday.
</P>

"Car sales were remarkably slow in January, probably in part
because of dramatic stock market fluctuations that flustered
consumers at a time when the housing market and other economic
uncertainties were also making headlines," said Jesse Toprak,
executive director for industry analysis at the auto information
site Edmunds.com.
</P>
<P>
Toprak and others predict January sales will be down 3 percent
and that few automakers will escape unscathed. January sales are
normally lower after the holiday rush in December. But analysts
say this year is notable because the landscape isn't expected to
improve until the second half of 2008 at the earliest, when
automakers introduce new products and the election brings
political uncertainty to an end.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, buyers are skittish. Earlier this week, the
Conference Board, a consumer research group, said its latest
survey showed consumers were more pessimistic about the economy
in January than they had been in December. The group said most of
the 5,000 U.S. households surveyed expect business conditions and
employment to deteriorate further in the months ahead. Analysts
say that will have a direct affect on the auto industry.
</P>
<P>
"Our sense is macroeconomic pressures, particularly deteriorating
consumer confidence and gas 'permanently' above $3 a gallon, will
increasingly catch up with consumers throughout 2008, weighing on
demand for durable goods," Bear Stearns analyst Peter Nesvold
said in a recent note to investors. "For many consumers, a new
vehicle purchase has become largely a discretionary item."
</P>
<P>
Goldman Sachs analyst Robert Barry said that while consumers can
take comfort in the fact that gas prices seem to be stabilizing,
they are still scared off by the weak labor market. Barry
predicts annual sales of 15 million vehicles in 2008, which would
be the lowest U.S. sales rate since 1993. Other analysts forecast
higher sales, but most automakers and analysts have said sales
will likely fall below 16 million. Automakers sold 16.3 million
vehicles in 2007.
</P>
<P>
General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler LLC could take
the biggest blows as they make promised reductions in low-profit
sales to rental-car fleets. Ford reduced rental fleet sales by 32
percent in 2007 and has vowed to make more -- although less
aggressive -- cuts in 2007. GM cut fleet sales by 15 percent and
plans more cuts this year, while Chrysler Vice Chairman Jim Press
said earlier this month that rental fleet sales propped up 2007
results but would be cut this year.
</P>
<P>
The environment could make it harder for automakers to hold the
line on incentive spending. Automakers have been trying to rely
less on costly incentives, and Nesvold said the level of December
spending -- an average of $2,746 (euro1,854) per vehicle
industrywide -- was down from a year earlier. Still, December
spending was 7 percent higher than November, which was 4 percent
higher than October, indicating that automakers are trying to
shore up the market with incentives.
</P>
<P>
That trend could get worse before it gets better. GM and Toyota
Motor Corp., already locked in a battle in the full-size pickup
market, could pile on more incentives to hold onto their share as
Ford and Chrysler introduce new pickups this fall. Toyota and GM
were already putting nearly $3,000 (euro2,026) per vehicle on
their new full-size trucks in 2007.
</P>
<P>
Toprak said Honda Motor Co. is one of the few automakers who
could buck the trend in January. Honda's sales were strong in the
last few months of 2007 thanks to its Honda Fit subcompact and
redesigned Honda Accord sedan, and that could carry into 2008 as
consumers look for more fuel-efficient cars.
