Michael Moore to release new film online for free

NEW YORK 2008-09-04 20:04:24 UTC
</P>
<P>
Inspired by Neil Young and Radiohead, Michael Moore will release
his new film online and for free.
</P>
<P>
The film, "Slacker Uprising," follows Moore's 62-city tour during
the 2004 election to rally young voters. It will be available for
three weeks as a free download to North American residents,
beginning Sept. 23. An official announcement of the film is
planned for Friday.
</P>
<P>
Moore said he considered releasing "Slacker Uprising"
theatrically as "Michael Moore's big election year movie" as he
did with 2004's "Fahrenheit 9/11," which was highly critical of
President Bush.
</P>
<P>
Instead, Moore opted for a symbol of gratitude to his fans as he
approaches the 20th anniversary of his first film, 1989's "Roger
&amp; Me."
</P>
<P>
"I thought it'd be a nice way to celebrate my 20th year of doing
this," Moore said. "And also help get out the vote for November.
I've been thinking about what I want to do to help with the
election this year."
</P>
<P>
The 97-minute long "Slacker Uprising" will be the first major
film to be released in such a way. Last December, "Jackass 2.5"
was streamed online and for free, but that was only a collection
of left over material from "Jackass 2." Companies like ClickStar,
which Morgan Freeman co-founded, have made films still in
theaters -- such as 2006's "10 Items or Less" -- digitally
available for purchase or rental.
</P>
<P>
Experimentation in distribution has been more common in the music
industry, where the Internet has significantly damaged
traditional business models. Moore took notice when Radiohead
last year released their seventh album, "In Rainbows," online
with optional pricing. In 2006, Neil Young streamed his anti-war
album "Living With War" for free before its standard release --
now a more common practice.
</P>
<P>
If history is any measure, "Slacker Uprising" could have made a
decent sum in theaters. His last two films, "Sicko" ($24 million)
and "Fahrenheit 9/11" ($119 million) are two of the three highest
grossing documentaries ever.
</P>
<P>
Moore said that "Slacker Uprising" cost about $2 million to make
and that he will end up paying about $1 million out of his
pocket. Neither he nor the distributor, Brave New Films, plan to
profit from the release.
</P>
<P>
The director's last film, "Sicko," leaked online and was
downloaded illegally in large numbers. He says this download,
offered by BlipTV, will be high-resolution and far better than
"YouTube quality."
</P>
<P>
To receive the download, people can sign up at
SlackerUprising.com. A "Night of a Thousand House Parties" is
planned for Oct. 4, when local neighborhood screenings are hoped
to be scheduled. A DVD will be released Oct. 7.
</P>
<P>
Moore last week released a paperback book, "Mike's Election Guide
2008" and is currently working on a movie for theatrical release
next year. That film is expected to examine America as an empire,
but the director declined to discuss any details about it.
</P>
<P>
For now, Moore hopes "Slacker Uprising" will help spur young
people to vote this November. After more than 20 million 18 to 29
-year-olds cast ballots in 2004 (an 11 percent increase from
2000), he's hoping even greater numbers of "slackers" vote this
year.
</P>
<P>
Moore readily acknowledges this a film for Democrats.
</P>
<P>
"This film, really isn't for anybody other than the choir," said
Moore. "But that's because I believe the choir needs a song to
sing every now and then."
