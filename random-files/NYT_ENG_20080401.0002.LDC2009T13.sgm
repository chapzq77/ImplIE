D.C. TO PUMP OIL LEADERS ON GASOLINE
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
Gasoline prices broke records again Monday as triple-digit oil
prices kept pressure on the pump, giving Congress a well-timed
set-up as it prepares to grill oil executives today on soaring
energy costs.
</P>
<P>
The national average price for regular unleaded climbed a
fraction of a penny to $3.29 a gallon, up 12 cents from a month
ago, AAA's Daily Fuel Gauge Report said. In Houston, the average
reached $3.22 a gallon, up 17 cents from last month, the motor
club said.
</P>
<P>
The records came on the eve of a congressional committee
appearance by executives from the nation's five largest oil
companies.
</P>
<P>
The title of the hearing -- "Drilling for Answers: Oil Company
Profits, Runaway Prices and Pursuit of Alternatives" -- hints at
the reception industry leaders may expect from the House Select
Committee on Energy Independence and Global Warming.
</P>
<P>
"This new gas prices record is a perfect example of why we need
these oil companies to go on the record with the American people
to discuss our dangerous dependence on oil," said Rep. Edward
Markey, D-Mass., chairman of the panel.
</P>
<P>
With pump prices high and the economy limping, U.S. gasoline
demand has declined recently. After growing at an average 1.5
percent for a decade, gasoline demand growth slowed to 0.4
percent in 2007 and demand is down 0.8 percent through the first
12 weeks of 2008, the U.S. Energy Information Administration
said.
</P>
<P>
U.S. gasoline stockpiles have swollen nearly 10 percent above
their five-year average in response, a situation that
historically might have helped cool down pump prices.
</P>
<P>
But $100-a-barrel crude oil has changed the equation and is
exerting a huge influence on the price of gasoline, said John
Felmy, chief economist at the American Petroleum Institute, an
industry trade group. The price of crude, which typically
accounts for about 48 percent of the price of gasoline, accounts
for 70 percent of the pump price today, he said.
</P>
<P>
Weak returns refiners have posted recently attest to the
industry's struggle to absorb higher crude costs, Felmy said.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, light, sweet crude for May delivery fell $4.04 to
$101.58 in trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. But it is
still up more than 50 percent from a year ago.
</P>
<P>
The difference between what refiners pay for a barrel of oil and
the price they get for products made from it is known as the
gross refining margin. This figure is widely used as a rough
indicator of the profitability of the refining business.
</P>
<P>
At current levels, refiners are seeing a margin of about $10 per
barrel of gasoline they produce, about half of what they've made
during early spring in recent years, said Eitan Bernstein,
industry analyst with Friedman, Billings, Ramsey &amp;amp; Co.
</P>
<P>
He projects that for 2008, refining margins will average $12 a
barrel, about 33 percent lower than last year's record $17.50 a
barrel but still high by historical standards, he said.
</P>
<P>
Refining margins often rise sharply in the spring and summer
months as gasoline demand increases during the vacation season.
</P>
<P>
The government anticipates pump prices will peak at a monthly
average of $3.50 a gallon sometime this spring as vacation
driving begins, topping $4 in some markets.
</P>
<P>
If that holds true, the price will surpass the inflation-adjusted
record of $3.40 a gallon set in March 1981.
</P>
<P>
"Gas prices are outrageous," said John Jardell, 33, as he paid
$20 to pump six gallons into his 1995 Lexus sedan Monday at a
Texaco station at Richmond and U.S. 59. "I'm not able to put in
as much gas as I used to."
</P>
<P>
Erick Hereda, a plumbing supply salesman, had the same complaint.
</P>
<P>
"You gotta have gas," Hereda said, putting $5 worth into his 1999
Chevy Tahoe at a Valero station on Westheimer. "What are you
going to do without it?"
</P>
<P>
A prominent consumer group released a report last week suggesting
oil companies are constricting U.S. fuel supplies and keeping
prices high.
</P>
<P>
Declining gasoline demand, flush fuel inventories and rising
ethanol output should have eased pump prices, the Consumer
Federation of America said. Instead, the industry has used its
market power to cut production and maintain that pressure, the
group said.
</P>
<P>
API officials flatly denied that allegation Monday.
</P>
<P>
"There's no way you can make those claims," Felmy said in a
conference call. "They simply just don't hold water."
</P>
<P>
John Seesel, associate general counsel for energy at the Federal
Trade Commission, said he also sees no reason to suspect
deliberate price manipulation.
</P>
<P>
"I've never seen a credible allegation that private oil companies
have much market power in crude oil, which appears to be the
biggest driver," Seesel said.
</P>
<P>
The FTC has investigated the refining industry in the past for
possible price manipulation and found nothing, he said. The
office has no active probe in progress, he said.
</P>
<P>
Today, Congress will take a turn putting the industry under the
microscope.
</P>
<P>
Scheduled to appear at the hearing are J. Stephen Simon, senior
vice president of Exxon Mobil Corp.; John Hofmeister, president
of Shell Oil Co.; Robert A. Malone, president of BP America;
Peter J. Robertson, vice chairman of Chevron Corp.; and John E.
Lowe, executive vice president of ConocoPhillips.
</P>
<P>
If the hearing seems familiar, it's because the industry has been
through this before -- many times, said Frank Maisano, cq a
principal with the law firm Bracewell &amp;amp; Giuliani LLP who
works on refinery issues.
</P>
<P>
"It's like a rite of spring," he said. "The cherry blossoms are
blooming, baseball has kicked off, and Congress is starting the
gas price hearings again."
