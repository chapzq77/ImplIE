Amsterdam shutters famous Yab Yum sex club due to suspected
criminal links

AMSTERDAM, Netherlands 2007-11-16 12:36:37 UTC

<P>
One of Amsterdam's best-known sex clubs has become the latest
victim of the city's crackdown on organized crime infiltration of
the city's world famous sex industry.
</P>
<P>
The Yab Yum club, located in a historic canalside mansion in
downtown Amsterdam, has long been an exclusive hang out for well-
heeled businessmen and tourists, but city fathers now believe its
owners could be engaging in "criminal transactions" and have
revoked its permit, Amsterdam Municipality spokesman Hendrik
Wooldrik said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Amsterdam has been conducting a crackdown on criminality in the
city center for nearly five years, using a 2002 law that forces
business operators to disclose detailed accounting in order to
have their licenses renewed.
</P>
<P>
A panel set up under the law concluded that there is a serious
risk the club's owners will use it as a front for criminal
activities. The owners were allowed to respond to the conclusion,
but could not convince the city not to withdraw its license, the
municipality said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Wooldrik would not elaborate on what kind of criminal activities
were suspected, but so-called private clubs and brothels have in
the past been accused of laundering money for crime gangs
involved in everything from drug dealing to extortion rackets.
</P>
<P>
The club's owners have been ordered to close it down within
weeks, but can appeal the decision to pull its license, Wooldrik
said.
</P>
<P>
Nobody answered the phone at Yab Yum on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Entry to the club costs euro70 (US$100), according to its Web
site, which shows pictures of an ornate bar and private rooms
featuring double beds and huge bath tubs.
</P>
<P>
Prostitution is legal in the Netherlands, but Amsterdam Mayor Job
Cohen says he wants to root out the "underlying criminality"
linked to the city's famed Red Light District.
</P>
<P>
In September, the city announced that a public housing
corporation had bought 18 buildings in the Red Light District to
redevelop them -- a deal that could lead up to the shuttering of
one third of the windows where scantily clad prostitutes stand to
attract customers.
