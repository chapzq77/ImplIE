A nonprofit group has started briefing departments and agencies
on the importance of properly "onboarding" new employees, after
releasing a report showing that the government and new employees
could benefit from well-run orientations.

The Partnership for Public Service report found that orientation
programs typically concentrate on administrative matters such as
filling out paperwork. What's needed, it said, is a more
comprehensive approach that involves teaching new employees about
the agency's mission and culture, including how employees relate
to each other and to outside groups, how collaborative the
workplace is, and how performance is rewarded.

Studies of private-sector employers, plus anecdotal evidence from
agencies, show that good onboarding programs improve retention
and get new workers up to full performance levels sooner, said
Max Stier, president of the Partnership. "There's some set of
folks that are leaving because it was not a good fit, but you can
also infer that there are some who are leaving because they were
not effectively engaged by their employer," he said.
</P>
<P>
The report, produced in conjunction with the Booz Allen Hamilton
consulting firm, recommends that new employees be assigned a
sponsor who can help integrate them into the organization, and
that senior leadership, managers and supervisors become
personally involved in the transition and not leave the task to
the human resources office.
