Tourists evacuate as Gustav grows near Jamaica

KINGSTON, Jamaica 2008-08-28 15:17:53 UTC

<P>
Tropical Storm Gustav surged toward hurricane force on Thursday
as it drove toward Jamaica and aimed for the Cayman islands,
prompting evacuations of tourists and offshore oil workers. In
its wake, impoverished Haitians scrambled for food. Meanwhile,
New Orleans kept nervous watch, three years after Katrina's
destruction.
</P>
<P>
Gustav -- the cause of flooding and mudslides that killed 23 in
Haiti and the Dominican Republic -- was nearly stationary about
80 miles (130 kilometers) east of Jamaica's low-lying capital,
but it was expected to run west-southwest later in the day, very
close to the shore.
</P>
<P>
Its top sustained winds were just below hurricane strength at
about 70 mph (110 kph), according to the National Hurricane
Center in Miami.
</P>
<P>
Also Thursday, Tropical Storm Hanna formed in the Atlantic,
northeast of the northern Leeward Islands.
</P>
<P>
It was too early to predict whether Hanna will threaten the
United States, but Gustav was already causing jitters from
Mexico's Cancun resort to the Florida panhandle. Gustav was
projected to become a major Category 3 hurricane over warm and
deep Gulf waters, sending oil prices jumping above US$120 a
barrel Thursday on fears of production slowdowns.
</P>
<P>
Royal Dutch Shell PLC has evacuated nearly 400 people and said it
will pull out another 270 Thursday, affecting production. BP PLC
also removed personnel from the region that produces about a
quarter of U.S. crude and much of its natural gas. Transocean,
the world's biggest offshore drilling contractor, is suspending
operations at all of its rigs and pulling nearly 1,600 people out
of the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
Some models showed Gustav taking a path toward Louisiana and
other Gulf states devastated by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita three
years ago.
</P>
<P>
Jamaican authorities urged people in rural areas to seek shelter,
but businesses remained open early Thursday in Kingston, where a
steady drizzle was falling from dark clouds.
</P>
<P>
Emergency officials opened shelters and sent relief supplies to
flood-prone areas.
</P>
<P>
Gustav hit Haiti as a hurricane on Tuesday, causing floods and
landslides that killed 15 people on Haiti's deforested southern
peninsula, where it dumped 12 inches (30 centimeters) or more of
rain. A landslide buried eight people, including a mother and six
of her children, in the neighboring Dominican Republic.
</P>
<P>
Gustav's projected track pointed directly at the Cayman Islands,
an offshore banking center where residents boarded up homes and
stocked up on emergency supplies.
</P>
<P>
Forecasters said Gustav might slip between Mexico's Yucatan
Peninsula and the western tip of Cuba on Sunday, then March
toward a Tuesday collision with the U.S. Gulf Coast -- anywhere
from south Texas to the Florida panhandle.
</P>
<P>
"We know it's going to head into the Gulf. After that, we're not
sure," said meteorologist Rebecca Waddington at the National
Hurricane Center. "For that reason, everyone in the Gulf needs to
be monitoring the storm."
</P>
<P>
New Orleans began planning a possible mandatory evacuation,
hoping to prevent the chaos it saw after Hurricane Katrina struck
three years ago Friday. Mayor Ray Nagin left the Democratic
National Convention in Denver to help the city prepare.
</P>
<P>
Any damage to the Gulf oil infrastructure could send U.S.
gasoline prices spiking.
</P>
<P>
"A bad storm churning in the Gulf could be a nightmare scenario,"
said Phil Flynn, an analyst at Alaron Trading Corp. in Chicago.
"We might see oil prices spike US$5 to US$8 if it really rips
into platforms."
</P>
<P>
Cuba, Haiti and the Dominican Republic were still getting heavy
rain Thursday, and rising waters damaged many homes.
</P>
<P>
In the low-lying Cayman Islands, where Gustav is expected to hit
Friday, tourists flocked to the airport to get out before the
storm.
</P>
<P>
Stacey McLaughlan of Albany, New York, said she and her husband
were told to leave their resort by noon Thursday or prepare to
move to a public shelter.
</P>
<P>
Cayman Airways pilot Chris Witt says a lot of evacuation flights
are planned for Thursday, but McLaughlan said she and her husband
had to pay an extra US$1,000 to get out because their airline
refused to bring in a plane to return them to the U.S.
</P>
<P>
Finding affordable food was an immediate priority for many in
Haiti. Jean Ramando, an 18-year-old banana grower, said winds
tore down a dozen of his family's banana trees, so bushels of 60
bananas they once sold to Port-au-Prince markets for 135 gourdes
($3.55) would have to be moved at prices as high as 300 gourdes
($7.80).
</P>
<P>
"The wind blew them down quickly so we need to make some money
quickly," he said as he carried bushels through floodwaters.
</P>
<P>
In the Dominican Republic, friends and relatives buried a mother
and six of her seven children, smothered when a landslide crushed
their tin-roofed shack.
</P>
<P>
Marcelina Feliz, 32, was found hugging the body of her smallest
child, rescue officials said. A neighbor was also killed.
</P>
<P>
"I don't know how I can live now, because none of my family is
left," said Marino Borges, her husband and father of several of
her children.
