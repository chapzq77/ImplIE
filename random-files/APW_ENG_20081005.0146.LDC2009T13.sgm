Placido Domingo sings at Mexico pyramid

CHICHEN ITZA, Mexico 2008-10-05 05:58:46 UTC

<P>
Tenor Placido Domingo peppered his classical repertoire with a
crowd-pleasing array of popular music and even donned a mariachi
suit and sang along with the audience, smoothing over controversy
surrounding his Saturday concert at the Mayan pyramids of Chichen
Itza.
</P>
<P>
With help from Mexican crooner Armando Manzanero and Puerto Rican
soprano Ana Maria Martinez, an ebullient Domingo won over the
crowd with encores ranging from West Side Story's "Tonight," to
the popular ballad of southern Yucatan state, "Peregrina."
</P>
<P>
Domingo and Martinez also joined forces on a thundering, majestic
tribute to the Mayan ruins in "The Silver Moon of Chichen Itza,"
by Lorena Tassinari, which he called "a kind of Mayan hymn."
</P>
<P>
The singers were dwarfed by the hulking mass of the site's main
pyramid, eerily illuminated in red against a black sky, and the
concert began with Mayan-style music from by The Monumental
Chorus of the Mayab, accompanied by Indian drums
</P>
<P>
The estimated 4,000 fans attending seemed unconcerned about
complaints that the concert and others like it exploit or misuse
the 1,200-year-old Mayan ruins. The concert's name is a reference
to a temple platform at Chichen Itza crowned by rows of columns.
</P>
<P>
"It is marvelous to be here," Domingo said during a break.
</P>
<P>
"It is an honor for us to have a concert like this," said Armando
de Leon from the nearby city of Merida.
</P>
<P>
Herman Segovia came all the way from San Antonio, Texas, to hear
Domingo, whom he called "an artist of high quality."
</P>
<P>
"I don't think the site will be damaged. This is a controlled
event," Segovia said.
</P>
<P>
Karen Eddy, originally of Toronto, Canada, traveled to the
concert from her current home in Mexico City because "I thought
it would be magical, just magical" to see Domingo sing in front
of the towering main pyramid.
</P>
<P>
Archaeologists and activists have complained that concerts like
Saturday's expose ruin sites to additional damage and degrade
their cultural significance by treating them as mere backdrops.
</P>
<P>
Mexico's federal government turns down most requests to hold
concerts at ancient temples. But it faces increasing pressure
from state governors to promote ruins which, critics argue, are
already swamped with tourists.
</P>
<P>
Officials did impose limits on stage and seating structures and
the number of spectators for Domingo's concert, ensuring that it
would be smaller than tenor Luciano Pavarotti's 1997 appearance
at Chichen Itza, which drew 17,000. Since then, more than a half
dozen concerts have been held at or near the ruins.
</P>
<P>
Despite intermittent drops of rain, Domingo opened masterfully
with the inspiring "O Souverain" from Massenet's Le Cid.
</P>
<P>
Domingo and local hero Manzanero won a standing ovation for a
duet -- which the Mexican sang party in Mayan -- on Manzanero's
love ballad "Adoro." Manzanero, a Yucatan native, is best known
for his interpretation of ballads such as "Contigo Aprendi" and
"Nada Personal." The Indian language is still spoken by almost a
million people in the region.
</P>
<P>
The Spanish-born Domingo grew up in Mexico, and enthusiastic fans
in the southern state of Yucatan erupted in applause on Saturday
at his "Concert of 1,000 Columns." Many here see it like a
homecoming; one of Domingo's first performances was in Yucatan in
1957.
</P>
<P>
Domingo sang Zarzuela from his native Spain, and drew a swell of
applause for the classic Granada.
</P>
<P>
But the audience went wild when, in an encore, Domingo donned a
silver-buttoned suit like the ones used by Mexico's cowboy-
singers and belted out mariachi classics like "El Rey", at times
asking the audience to sing along.
</P>
<P>
The program also includes the melancholy, melodic "Lamento di
Federico" from Francesco Cilea's "L'Arlesiana," and the soaring
"Gia nella notte densa" from Verdi's Otello. The classical
repertoire ended on a strong note with "No Puede Ser" from
Sorozabal's La Tabernera del Puerto.
