<P>
German train drivers ended a 30-hour strike Friday morning
against commuter and regional services across the country but did
not get closer to an end of the conflict with the national rail
operator.
</P>
<P>
The GDL union's strike, which started Thursday at 2 a.m.
(0000GMT) and ended Friday at 8 a.m. (0600GMT), was the third
such walkout -- the longest one yet -- in a pay dispute with
railway operator Deutsche Bahn AG.
</P>
<P>
GDL wants better working conditions and a significant pay rise
for train drivers.
</P>
<P>
More than 2,000 train drivers walked off their jobs, according to
GDL, and only one out of every two trains ran in western Germany
on Friday morning. The east was even worse-hit with only 10
percent of all regional trains running.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the union said the motivation among the striking
train drivers was still very strong and that GDL would announce
at a news conference later Friday further plans regarding strikes
next week.
</P>
<P>
"The willingness to strike is high and unbroken," Maik
Brandenburger said.
</P>
<P>
GDL hopes to pressure Deutsche Bahn into giving in to its demands
of a cut in the working week by one hour to 40 hours and a pay
increase of up to 31 percent for its members.
</P>
<P>
It has rejected a 4.5 percent raise that Deutsche Bahn agreed to
in talks with two other unions that represent railway workers.
</P>
<P>
Deutsche Bahn carries some 5 million passengers daily.
