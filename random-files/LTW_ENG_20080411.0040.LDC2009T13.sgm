Raw Drama Under One Roof

"Alice's House," the debut feature of longtime documentary
filmmaker Chico Teixeira, follows the ups and downs (mostly the
downs) of a six-member Brazilian working-class family in Sao
Paulo. Alice (Carla Ribas), who works in a beauty parlor, is at
the center of it all, living with her mother, who's slowly going
blind; a philandering husband; and three sons. One son is a
soldier by day and a male prostitute by night, another steals
from grandma and the angelic youngest sits around in teen
mopiness. When Alice decides to take up with an old flame, who's
also married, the insanity level of the household reaches fever
pitch.

Yes, we seem to be watching all the secrets, unmet aspirations,
hatred, bitterness and frustration that we can cram under one
roof. But "Alice's House" isn't pitched as family farce or even
soap opera. It's more of a naturalistic tableau of humans trying
to negotiate the twists and turns of life with their own
desperations and inadequacies. Even though it sounds awfully
depressing, there's something moving about watching people go at
their lives with everything they have -- or don't have.

As Alice, Ribas has wowed international film festival juries,
winning several awards. She'll wow you, too, with her character's
aching vulnerabilities as all of Sao Paulo seems to sag heavily
on her shoulders.
