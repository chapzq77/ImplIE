European markets helped by oil, Dow down

LONDON 2008-10-17 16:46:33 UTC
</P>
<P>
European markets rose strongly Friday as a recovery in the price
of oil helped oil stocks, but Wall Street was down after further
grim U.S. economic news.
</P>
<P>
The FTSE 100 index of leading British shares was 201.62 points,
or 5.2 percent, higher at 4,063.01, while Germany's DAX was up
158.52 points, or 3.4 percent, at 4,781.33. France's CAC-40 was
up 148.92 points, or 4.7 percent, at 3,329.92. Europe's indexes
were higher through the day in the wake of the Dow's strong
performance Thursday and the recovery on Japan's Nikkei.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, the Dow Jones index underperformed Europe's indexes,
trading 46.28 points, or 0.5 percent, lower at 8,932.98 after
further evidence emerged that the U.S. is heading for a deep and
protracted recession.
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department reported that housing starts fell more
than 6 percent in September to an annual rate of 817,000 units, a
near 18-year low, while and the University of Michigan said its
U.S. consumer confidence index slumped to 57.5 in October from
70.3 the previous month.
</P>
<P>
"The drop back in U.S. consumer confidence in October suggests
that the meltdown in the financial markets, rising unemployment
and the continued weakness in housing more than offset any
positive boost from lower gasoline prices," said Paul Ashworth,
senior U.S. economist at Capital Economics.
</P>
<P>
It's been an erratic week on Wall Street, with the Dow soaring
936 points on Monday, slipping moderately Tuesday, sinking 733
points Wednesday, and then rallying 401 points Thursday. The
volatility is not providing investors with much relief, but it is
a welcome change from last week's seemingly relentless plunge,
during which the Dow logged its worst week ever and Wall Street
lost about $2.4 trillion in shareholder wealth.
</P>
<P>
The long-term key to the health of financial markets is whether
the flurry of activity by governments over the last week or so
can actually break the logjam in credit markets.
</P>
<P>
There are growing signs the coordinated interest rate reductions
announced last week, and massive liquidity boosts by central
banks, are beginning to reduce lending rates between banks.
</P>
<P>
The interbank lending rate for three-month dollar loans fell for
the fifth day running, the first weekly decline in three months.
It dropped 0.08 percent to 4.42 percent, while the three-month
Euro Interbank Offered Rate, or Euribor, fell almost 0.045
percentage points to 5.045 percent.
</P>
<P>
Though the rates are falling, the differential between the rate
at which banks lend to each other and official central bank
lending rates remain high, signalling a strong degree of mistrust
still exists. In the U.S. the base central bank rate is 1.5
percent, while in the euro area it stands at 3.75 percent.
</P>
<P>
"Even if the financial maelstrom may be about to abate it is not
over," said Russell Jones, global head of fixed income and
currency strategy at RBC Capital Markets.
</P>
<P>
"A serious global recession is 'baked in the cake' and this is
bound to mean that there will be further pulses of risk aversion,
further traumas for financial sectors and markets and acute pain
both for corporate sectors and for individuals," he added.
</P>
<P>
Though the rescue packages have helped alleviate the pressures on
the banking system, threats in the financial system remain, from
credit default swaps -- which insure against defaults on
securities -- from the insurance sector and from emerging
markets.
</P>
<P>
Following the bailout of the banks, investor concerns have moved
onto the insurance sector. Dutch bank and insurer ING Groep NV
was the latest to suffer in the stock markets Friday on media
reports that the company is in need of cash. Its shares were down
19 percent at euro8.20 (US$10.98).
</P>
<P>
Concerns about the global economic outlook have taken their toll
on oil prices in recent days, which fell Thursday to near
14-month lows below US$70 before recovering US$1.92 Friday to
US$71.77.
</P>
<P>
Friday's modest recovery in the oil price helped some stocks in
Europe recover ground, notably BP PLC and Royal Dutch Shell on
the FTSE, which both rose 8 percent. Both had suffered major
drops Thursday when oil prices dropped steeply.
</P>
<P>
Despite Friday's rise, oil prices are half what they were just
three months ago and that is weighing on countries dependent on
oil exports, such as Russia. Its indexes continued their losing
streak on Friday, with the MICEX dropping 4.3 percent and the RTS
down 6.48 percent.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Tokyo's Nikkei 225 stock average advanced 235.27 points,
or 2.78 percent, at 8,693.82. The index was still far from
recouping Thursday's 11.4 percent loss -- its biggest one-day
percentage drop since the stock market crash of October 1987. For
the week, the Nikkei gained 5 percent, much better than the 24
percent it lost last week.
</P>
<P>
Compared to the gyrations earlier this week, Asian markets were
moderately more stable.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai's index rose for the first time in a week. But Hong
Kong's Hang Seng index dropped over 4 percent to 14,554.21, its
lowest level in almost three years as selling accelerated late in
the day after banks said they would help investors in Lehman
Brothers-backed bonds recouped some of their money. Australia,
Singapore and South Korea also closed lower.
</P>
<P>
In currencies, the dollar declined slightly to 101.14 yen from
101.30 yen late Thursday. The euro was down at US$1.3450 from
US$1.3492.
