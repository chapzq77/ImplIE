AS JAPAN AGES, UNIVERSITIES STRUGGLE TO FILL CLASSES

DAZAIFU, Japan
</P>
<P>
When Yasunori Iwanaga was choosing universities three years ago,
it was not the academic program, the strong team in judo, his
favorite sport, or even the study abroad program in England that
swayed him to choose Fukuoka University of Economics.
</P>
<P>
It was the hot spring in the dormitories.
</P>
<P>
Perched immodestly on the edge of a steaming bath, a dozen judo
teammates soaking happily near him, the junior in economics said
he picked this university when he saw the spa pictured in a
brochure. The university's resortlike new dormitories also boast
private karaoke rooms, an English garden with pink roses and a
swimming pool.
</P>
<P>
"This was the only university to recruit us by offering a hot
spring," Iwanaga, 21, said. "They really wanted us to come here."
</P>
<P>
Japan has one of the oldest and most established systems of
higher education in Asia, but today its universities are
scrambling to find new ways to attract students. Years of falling
birthrates have rapidly shrunk the population of young Japanese,
leaving more universities unable to find enough students to fill
their classrooms and campuses.
</P>
<P>
The rapid graying of Japan's population has already been felt in
other parts of society, including the lower rungs of the nation's
education system where hundreds of half-empty elementary and high
schools have closed or been merged over the last two decades. But
it has only recently begun to affect higher education. Japan's
postwar baby boom started earlier than America's. As a result,
according to census statistics, the number of 18-year-olds in
Japan peaked at 2.05 million in 1992, when the baby boomers'
children were entering universities, and has fallen steadily, to
1.3 million this year. Estimates show it dropping to 1.21 million
in two years. This year, as a result, nearly a third of the
nation's 707 public and private four-year universities cannot
fill all of their openings, according to the Education Ministry
and university groups. Roughly half of college-age Japanese
attend universities. Only three universities have gone bankrupt
for lack of students. Three years ago, Hiroshima's Risshikan
University became the first Japanese university to fail since
World War II. But the Education Ministry and university groups
are busily writing guidelines to help them deal with a
retrenchment that few developed nations have had to face.
</P>
<P>
"We are entering an era of survival of the fittest," said
Yasuhiko Nishii, an official at the Promotion and Mutual Aid
Corporation for Private Schools of Japan, the national
association of private schools, including universities. "We need
to find ways to let weaker universities close without disrupting
the education of their students."
</P>
<P>
Many universities have responded by hunting for new pools of
prospective students, such as foreigners and "silver students,"
retirees who study for fun. In March, Osaka University gave a
doctorate in mathematics to a 71-year-old former engineer who
entered graduate school after retiring.
</P>
<P>
At Fukuoka University of Economics, in this city on Kyushu, a
southern island, administrators responded to the plunge in
applications with a $50 million project in 1999 to build lavish
dormitories, in which all 700 rooms are singles -- a luxury on
Japan's traditionally Spartan campuses -- and are wired for the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
The university has also halved tuition to 590,000 yen, or about
$5,000. The school also created a "celebrity business" major to
train professional entertainers, after administrators saw a
survey showing many young Japanese now aspiring to creative
pursuits like music, rather than the "salaryman" positions sought
by their parents' generation.
</P>
<P>
The prospect of universities fighting to win students has
prompted national hand-wringing about the future of Japanese
higher education. Since the founding in 1877 of the nation's
first modern university, the University of Tokyo, Japanese
universities and their grueling entrance exams have been the
society's main mechanism for sorting its youth, tracking the
brightest into top business and government jobs. Many fear that
this mechanism could be impaired if universities lower standards
to attract more students.
</P>
<P>
But in a country where higher education has long been viewed as a
four-year break before entering the work force, some
administrators welcome the competition, saying it will force
schools to improve the quality of instruction -- or perish.
Atsushi Hamana, president of Kansai University of International
Studies in Miki, Japan, says that schools are realizing that
young people actually want to study to get the skills to compete
in a globalizing economy.
</P>
<P>
"It's ironic, but it took this crisis to make universities
realize they actually have to educate their students," Hamana
said.
</P>
<P>
Another promising change has been an opening of Japan's doors to
more foreign students, whose numbers have increased in recent
years, but are still far fewer than in America. Ritsumeikan Asia
Pacific University, founded in 2000 in Beppu, a southern city,
could be the shape of things to come in Japan. Almost half its
5,421 students are from overseas, mainly China and South Korea.
About 42 percent of the 128 faculty members are also foreign,
including the president, who is from Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
Half of the classes are taught in English. The university is also
unusual in Japan because it has a full-fledged, American-style
career office to help students find jobs. The university has been
rapidly expanding, and its international environment and solid
academic program have proved a draw for young Japanese: Last
year, 3,753 applied for about 750 spots.
</P>
<P>
What Japanese universities are desperate to avoid is a fate like
that of Hagi International University, one of the three
universities to fail because of too few students.
</P>
<P>
Hagi converted from a two-year junior college to a four-year
university in 1999 with grandiose plans of becoming the region's
top school. But from the beginning, it failed to attract its
annual capacity of 300 freshmen. The campus became increasingly
empty as new enrollees dropped from about 200 the first year to
just three in 2006, the school said.
</P>
<P>
The university first tried to fill its thinning ranks by
recruiting in China, but the immigration authorities stopped that
in 2002 after 26 Chinese students disappeared, apparently to work
illegally in Japan, the university said. Next, it hired a top
professional golfer and offered Japan's first major in golf
culture, but that drew only about 30 students.
</P>
<P>
Deep in the red, Hagi International sought court protection for
bankruptcy in 2005.
</P>
<P>
"We tried to find ways to attract new students," said Masanori
Hatachi, the president of the university, which now has a new
owner and a new name, Yamaguchi University of Human Welfare and
Culture. "Problem was, there just weren't a lot of new students
to be found."
</P>
<P>
After bankruptcy, the university was taken over by a construction
company and revived in April as a smaller university offering
degrees in the health field. Hatachi said the new focus should
make it more competitive because in rapidly graying Japan, care
for the elderly is one of the few guaranteed growth markets for
young job seekers.
</P>
<P>
"It's not enough anymore to offer a traditional education," he
said. "A university has to be a place where students think they
can learn what they need."
