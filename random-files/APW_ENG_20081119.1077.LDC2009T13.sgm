Crisis in paradise: Meltdown leaves ghost resorts

PUNTA CANA, Dominican Republic 2008-11-19 18:22:54 UTC

The ocean glows a milky turquoise. Tiny waves lap at the powder-
beige sand, in no rush to reach the line of postcard-perfect palm
trees.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of luxury villas are positioned to take in the view, but
there are no guests. There are no roofs either; neatly tied
bundles of red tiles are stacked outside. The wind slams doors
and rustles the yellowed newspaper taped to the windows.
</P>
<P>
The paralyzed work scene at the Cap Cana resort, a development
including four luxury hotels, three golf courses and a mega-yacht
marina, is a victim of the global financial crisis that has hit
the Caribbean's tourism industry especially hard.
</P>
<P>
Cap Cana fired 500 workers last month after Lehman Brothers
declared bankruptcy and a $250 million loan fell through. Talks
to re-negotiate a $100 million short-term loan collapsed last
week, and more layoffs are expected.
</P>
<P>
"Our project has been affected by the economic tsunami that has
paralyzed the global financial markets," said Cap Cana President
Ricardo Hazoury.
</P>
<P>
Construction is also paralyzed at the Ritz-Carlton Molasses Reef
resort in secluded West Caicos, where 60 Chinese workers revolted
last month to demand back wages. About 160 workers have been sent
home to China, and it's unclear when construction will resume at
the hotel, marina and condominium project, which is three-
quarters complete.
</P>
<P>
This month, the sprawling Atlantis resort in the Bahamas laid off
about 800 workers, citing low occupancy rates. Baha Mar Resorts
Ltd. laid off about 40 employees at its Sheraton Resort in the
Bahamas and 40 more at the Wyndham Nassau Resort. The Bahamas
Hotel Catering and Allied Workers Union has called a
demonstration Thursday to demand government aid.
</P>
<P>
"I've been in the business 38 years. I have seen the impact of
the Gulf War. I have seen the recession of the '80s. Certainly
Sept. 11," said Robert Sands, senior vice president of external
affairs at Baha Mar. "But nothing has been of a global nature,
which makes the current financial situation we're in much more
worrisome."
</P>
<P>
In Puerto Rico, the Caribe Hilton laid off more than 50 people
this month because of rising costs and sluggish occupancy rates.
The last time the hotel had to lay off workers was after the
Sept. 11 attacks, General Manager Jose Campo said.
</P>
<P>
"What worries me is that this will last longer," he said. "We are
mounting an aggressive campaign, but the situation is what it
is."
</P>
<P>
Even the normally busy holiday season is expected to be
relatively quiet.
</P>
<P>
"There is space available for the holiday season and beyond,"
said Alec Sanguinetti, CEO of the Caribbean Hotel &amp; Tourism
Association. "This is often a time when hotels are sold out and
vacationers are looking for any place that has availability."
</P>
<P>
Workers are spending their days off looking for jobs outside the
tourism industry. Others have already been sent home.
</P>
<P>
Victor Felipe Feliz, 24, has been feeding his two children on
store credit since he lost his construction job at Cap Cana last
month.
</P>
<P>
"I need to work so I can buy Pampers, so I can buy food," he
said. "It has been a couple of months since I bought clothes. I
can't afford anything."
</P>
<P>
Cap Cana plans to fire another 1,000 workers in the coming
months, according to a company official who spoke only on
condition of anonymity because he wasn't authorized to release
the information. But Cap Cana President Ricardo Hazoury said he
expects the project to go forward as the company outsources
certain services.
</P>
<P>
The 50-square-mile (130-square-kilometer) development is nestled
in the Dominican Republic's easternmost point amid lush jungle.
Its developers include Deutsche Bank, the Trump Organization and
the Ritz Carlton Hotel Company.
</P>
<P>
Cap Cana runs more like a city than a private development. It
generates its own power and water and has hundreds of villas and
condominiums -- even a school. Some of the villas and hotels are
inhabited, but most remain under construction.
</P>
<P>
"We used to have a lot of workers -- brick layers, plumbers,
electricians," said Wilkin Cuevamato, who was laid off but later
found work at another Cap Cana property. "The majority have left
and gone home."
</P>
<P>
The crisis has affected air travel as well. American Airlines,
the main carrier to Puerto Rico, has cut back flights by 44
percent, though other airlines are stepping in to reduce the
overall drop to 14 percent.
</P>
<P>
Some hotels are offering cheap, last-minute deals. Scott Berman,
a tourism adviser for Pricewaterhouse Coopers in Miami, says the
picture after the holiday season is bleak.
</P>
<P>
"It's fair to say that '09 is going to be a rough patch," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Getting money to finance new projects will be difficult amid the
credit squeeze. A new U.N. report predicts access to external
financing for the region will be limited, and what is available
will come with high interest rates.
</P>
<P>
But some remain optimistic. In September, even as the financial
crisis was gathering steam, Hilton Hotels Corp. announced plans
to build 17 hotels in the Caribbean, adding to the 13 it already
has.
</P>
<P>
"We have analyzed the region," said Gregory Rockett, who is
overseeing the expansion. "We are very confident that in the next
five years we can do these numbers."
</P>
<P>
And Sanguinetti points out that for North Americans, the
Caribbean remains a quick and attractive getaway.
</P>
<P>
"We provide a relaxing escape from the tensions that people are
facing at work during this economic crisis," he said. "We expect
that pent-up demand will be released."
