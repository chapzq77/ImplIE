Nissan woos young women with " cute marketing "

Ayano Sasao is defying the conventional wisdom that cars targeted
to a niche consumer category like young women are doomed to fail.
</P>
<P>
The 18-year-old Japanese hospital worker just bought the Nissan
Pino, a toylike minicar just 3.4 meters (11 feet) long with star-
stamped upholstery, a hook for a handbag and a chic "milk tea
beige" exterior -- although she says she almost went with the
pink.
</P>
<P>
"It's so cute. I just love it," she said.
</P>
<P>
To make sure women like Sasao get the message, Nissan Motor Co.
launched a merchandise line for Pino, including pink bear-shaped
cushions, seat covers with hearts, a CD case that looks like fat
red lips, and a colorful cover for a tissue box.
</P>
<P>
Ironically, Pino isn't even made by Nissan, Japan's third biggest
automaker. It's made by Suzuki Motor Inc.
</P>
<P>
But under a manufacturing agreement, Nissan packages Suzuki's
Alto model differently, with fancier seat fabric, a distinct
front design and a hubcap inspired by a snowflake so the wheels
appear to sparkle on the road -- all touches to give the car that
cute look.
</P>
<P>
Nissan had 5,500 orders for the Pino in the first month since it
went on sale in January, more than double the company target of
2,500 a month.
</P>
<P>
Sasao knew the Alto looked a lot like her Pino and was quite a
bit cheaper.
</P>
<P>
The Pino starts at about 1 million yen (US$8,600; euro6,500),
while the Alto starts at 650,000 yen (US$5,600; euro4,200). But
she still was willing to spend more -- and take out a six-year
auto loan -- for the Pino because she thought it was so much
cuter.
</P>
<P>
While models such as sportscars or family minivans target
segments of the population, auto companies generally avoid
producing models aimed at narrow niche markets because they
usually don't sell in numbers.
</P>
<P>
Toyota Motor Corp. officials often say they don't believe in
overly specific marketing tactics, which are apt to backfire for
an automaker known for best-sellers like the Camry and Corolla.
</P>
<P>
And in most countries, experts tend to advise against making
autos pink or adding other "cute" features to appeal to female
drivers partly because that may smack of sexism and turn off
women -- except in Japan.
</P>
<P>
Here, young women are extremely powerful in setting trends, and
the culture of cute is so prevalent grown men aren't embarrassed
about dangling little mascots from cell phones.
</P>
<P>
Also, Japanese consumers frequently use personal products to show
off who they are, often buying designer-brand products to make a
statement, said Kazuo Ikegami, marketing expert and professor at
Rissho University.
</P>
<P>
"Product image is far more important for Japanese consumers than
American consumers," Ikegami said. "There's a much bigger element
of personal identity in Japanese marketing."
</P>
<P>
Even the advertising for Pino is tailored to women who are about
20 years old.
</P>
<P>
The pamphlet is manga-style, like a Japanese comic book,
depicting the story of three young well-dressed women going
shopping together, manicuring their nails to match the star-
patterns on Pino seats, using aromatherapy oils in the car. The
TV ads also tell a similar story.
</P>
<P>
Nissan marketing manager Miwa Ishii says one goal for Pino is to
court young drivers to the Nissan brand with hopes they'll move
on to buy more expensive models in the future.
</P>
<P>
Ishii said the Net store Nissan opened especially for Pino
goodies is aimed at attracting online shoppers, who tend to live
in areas far from the glitzy stores of Tokyo and other cities --
exactly the demographics of those who buy minicars.
</P>
<P>
"Rather than talk about the features of a minicar, we thought
it's better to talk about how cute it is," she said. "It's a new
model. We're starting from zero to build public awareness about
it."
