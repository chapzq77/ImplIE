Sri Lanka troops take Tiger bases, blast kills commandos
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Sri Lankan troops Friday captured four Tamil Tiger jungle bases
in the island's northeast, the defence ministry said, as three
police commandos were killed in a blast elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said in a statement that 150 Tigers had been holding
the bases and searches suggested many had been killed or wounded.
</P>
<P>
In the adjoining district of Batticaloa, troops kept up the
shelling of suspected Tiger positions in a new offensive to
advance into a jungle area held by the guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) said they were
resisting the military onslaught.
</P>
<P>
"The Sri Lankan military attempt to move from the Black Bridge
towards the LTTE area of Koduvamadhu was thwarted," the LTTE said
in a statement.  "One body of a Sri Lankan soldier was also
recovered by the LTTE."
</P>
<P>
The Tigers added about 7,000 civilians were on the run to escape
the latest fighting.
</P>
<P>
Further south, in the Ampara district, three commandos were
killed and 16 wounded in a powerful explosion on Friday, military
officials said.
</P>
<P>
Government troops, backed by artillery and multi-barrel rocket
fire, have been on the offensive in the districts of Batticaloa
and Ampara, where the Tamil rebels control a vast jungle area
known as Thoppigala.
</P>
<P>
The latest offensive is the biggest since troops captured the
town of Vakarai from the Tigers in January after weeks of heavy
fighting in Batticaloa district.
</P>
<P>
The government has said it wants to clear the entire eastern
province of Tamil Tiger rebels, and Thoppigala is the last rebel
bastion in Batticaloa and Ampara districts.
</P>
<P>
More than 4,000 people have been killed in escalating fighting
since December 2005 even though the two sides agreed to a truce
five years ago.
