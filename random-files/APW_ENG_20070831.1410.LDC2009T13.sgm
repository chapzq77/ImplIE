Republican senator will not seek sixth term, offering valuable
opportunity to Democrats in US Congress

CHARLOTTESVILLE, Virginia 2007-08-31 19:58:23 UTC

<P>
Republican Senator John Warner of Virginia, one of the most
authoritative voices in the U.S. Congress on the military and a
key figure in the debate over Iraq, said Friday he will not seek
a sixth term in 2008.
</P>
<P>
Warner, 80, has held the seat since 1979, when the dashing former
U.S. Navy secretary campaigned alongside his wife at the time,
Elizabeth Taylor.
</P>
<P>
Warner is leaving what would have been a safe seat for the
Republicans if he had chosen to run again. His departure gives
Democrats a better chance to protect or even expand their one-
seat majority in the U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
Warner, former chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee,
became a respected voice on the Iraq war because of his cautious
views and loyalty to President George W. Bush, as well as his
expertise on national security issues.
</P>
<P>
After returning from the Iraq last week, Warner suggested that
some troops should leave by the end of the year. His remarks
roiled the White House, and Bush administration officials asked
him to clarify that he had not broken politically with the
president. Warner stood by his comments.
</P>
<P>
Warner, a courtly senator with chiseled features and a full shock
of gray hair, chose a sentimental setting for his announcement:
the steps of the University of Virginia's signature structure,
the Rotunda, designed by school founder Thomas Jefferson. Warner
graduated from the university's law school in 1953.
</P>
<P>
The Republican Party nominated Warner for the Senate in 1978 and
Warner was elected by the razor-thin margin of 4,721 votes out of
1.2 million cast. He was easily re-elected in 1984 and 1990.
</P>
<P>
"Public service is a privilege and I urge all to try to find time
some time in their lifetime to serve the needs of others," Warner
said Friday. "I have tried to be not only true to myself, but
true to the people of this great commonwealth I've served for 29
years now."
</P>
<P>
Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton said she will miss her "friend and
colleague."
</P>
<P>
"At a time when the tone in Washington is so often defined by
partisanship and rancor, Senator Warner has always risen above
the fray, focused on what he believed was the right course for
our nation," Clinton said.
