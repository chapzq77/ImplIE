Diagnosed cases of cancer rose by 10 percent in Europe over two
years, an increase attributable to the continent's ageing
population, the effects of smoking and better screening for
breast cancer,  doctors reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In 2006, there were 3.2 million new cases of cancer in 39
European countries, compared with 2.9 million in 2004, they said.
</P>
<P>
For the first time, breast cancer overtook lung cancer as the
commonest diagnosed cancer, with 429,000 new cases in 2006, or
nearly one in seven of the total.
</P>
<P>
It was followed by colorectal cancer, with 412,900 cases, and
lung cancer, 386,300 cases.
</P>
<P>
Lung cancer, though, remains the biggest killer, accounting for
334,800 out of the 1.7 million cancer deaths in Europe in 2006.
</P>
<P>
It was followed by colorectal cancer (207,400 deaths), breast
cancer (131,900) and stomach cancer (118,200).
</P>
<P>
The report was issued by the International Agency for Research on
Cancer (IARC), based in Lyon, southeastern France.
</P>
<P>
"The overwhelming majority of lung cancer is caused by tobacco
smoking," said IARC director Peter Boyle.
</P>
<P>
"Tobacco control is clearly a number one priority in Europe, not
only aimed at men, particularly the male populations of Central
and Eastern Europe, but increasingly targeted towards women,
especially in Northern Europe."
