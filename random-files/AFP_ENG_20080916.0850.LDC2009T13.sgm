Is Wall Street meltdown moment of truth in White House race?
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It took a real-world crisis to wrench the White House race away
from lipstick and pigs, with the Wall Street meltdown offering a
sudden chance of a breakout moment for Barack Obama or John
McCain.
</P>
<P>
After feuding all year over who could best handle a "3 am" call
in the White House, the candidates faced a real judgment call
when iconic investment bank Lehman Brothers went bankrupt,
sparking global stocks contagion.
</P>
<P>
Multiple polls show the staggering US economy is the number one
issue 49 days before election day, but also reveal Democrat Obama
and Republican McCain have yet to convince a majority of voters
they know how to fix it.
</P>
<P>
"Neither one of them has been able to craft a message that has
been able to reach the American people," said Andrew Dowdle,
assistant professor of political science at the University of
Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
Both McCain and Obama went in search of that message Monday,
courting voters who fear seeing their pension funds evaporate in
the stocks freefall amid warnings other revered US financial
instutitions were on the rocks.
</P>
<P>
Their focus on issues issue contrasted with last week's gutter
politics which included the McCain camp accusing Obama of
insulting Republican vice presidential pick Sarah Palin, in a
distortion of his use of the phrase "lipstick on a pig."
</P>
<P>
Obama Monday immediately blamed eight years of Republican rule
for the crisis, and predicted McCain would bring four more years
of the same.
</P>
<P>
His Republican rival promised a regulatory reform drive in Wall
Street, and said Obama would hike taxes and thwart economic
growth.
</P>
<P>
But the Arizona Senator, who now leads his rival by a few points
in national polls, opened himself up by declaring in Florida that
the fundamentals of the economy were "strong."
</P>
<P>
"Senator McCain, what economy are you talking about?" Obama asked
at a campaign event in Colorado, as his supporters immediately
branded McCain as out of touch and the inheritor to the Bush
administration's economic legacy.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the campaign Obama tried to capitalize on a comment by
McCain that he did not know as much about the economy as he
should.
</P>
<P>
Republicans have controlled the US purse strings for eight years,
the unemployment rate is at a five-year high of 6.1 percent,
gasoline and food prices are soaring and house prices are
tumbling.
</P>
<P>
Obama and the Democrats seem yet to have reached the levels of
empathy with hard-pressed voters achieved by his primary rival
Hillary Clinton, or famously by her husband Bill Clinton in the
1992 campaign.
</P>
<P>
"It is amazing that they have not been able to do that to this
point," said Dowdle.
</P>
<P>
An ABC News/Washington Post poll earlier this month found 47
percent of voters trusted Obama to run the economy and 42 percent
trusted McCain. The Democrat had enjoyed a much wider lead on the
issue for much of this year.
</P>
<P>
McCain has struggled to navigate away from Bush economic legacy,
and Democrats argue that his economic policies barely differ from
those of the current president.
</P>
<P>
But Carly Fiorina, a top economic advisor to McCain, blamed Wall
Street, lax regulation by the Bush administration and two years
of Democrats in control of Congress for the economic blight.
</P>
<P>
On MSNBC, Fiorina accused the Bush administration of presiding
over a "Wild, Wild, West," with little regulation -- positioning
McCain as a agent of reform and change -- not a prisoner of the
president's legacy.
</P>
<P>
McCain's spokesman Tucker Bounds issued an acidic response to
Obama's complaints about the Arizona senator's "fundamentals"
comment.
</P>
<P>
"Barack Obama's short career as a public servant has been defined
by pessimism, defeatism and weakness in the face of the great
challenges of our time," he said.
</P>
<P>
"His lack of faith in American workers may explain his
willingness to raise taxes during a struggling economy, but it is
not way to lead our country."
</P>
<P>
That comment appeared to be a direct attempt to draw attention to
Obama's short time as a national figure, and to raise doubts that
he was fit to take on the daunting challenge of pulling the US
economy out of its hole.
</P>
<P>
McCain is expected to press home that argument against Obama in
three potentially decisive presidential debates beginning on
September 26.
</P>
<P>
Obama supporters will see the forums as his best chance to
finally thrust home a winning message on the economy.
