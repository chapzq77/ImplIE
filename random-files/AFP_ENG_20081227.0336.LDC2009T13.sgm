Masses mourn Pakistan's Bhutto, one year on
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
More than 150,000 grieving Pakistanis thronged the tomb of slain
former premier Benazir Bhutto on Saturday, mourning their beloved
leader one year after her assassination.
</P>
<P>
A sea of sobbing mourners, some wailing and beating their chests
in a wrenching outpouring of emotion, flooded through security
checkpoints into the graveyard in rural southern Garhi Khuda
Bakhsh for the commemoration.
</P>
<P>
Thick fog had stranded tens of thousands on the roads leading
into the area early in the day, prompting authorities to delay
the start of the proceedings, but began to lift after noon.
</P>
<P>
Bhutto, 54, was assassinated on December 27, 2007 in a gun and
suicide attack at a campaign rally in the garrison city of
Rawalpindi, just two months after returning to Pakistan from
exile to vie for a third term in power.
</P>
<P>
Her shocking death threw the world's only nuclear-armed Islamic
nation into chaos, sparking violence and leading to months of
political turmoil that ended in September when her widower, Asif
Ali Zardari, claimed the presidency.
</P>
<P>
"In the tradition of a true Bhutto, she faced certain death
rather than abandon her principles or the people," Zardari said
in a message to the nation to mark the anniversary.
</P>
<P>
"The tyrants and the killers have killed her but they shall never
be able to kill her ideas, which drove and inspired a generation
to lofty aims," he said, adding that democracy was the only way
to fight militancy.
</P>
<P>
The masses travelled by train, bus, truck, car, bicycle and even
on foot to mourn the charismatic, Oxford-educated Bhutto, the
first woman to lead a Muslim nation who was hailed in the West as
a face of moderation.
</P>
<P>
Some slept Friday night in the open in near-freezing
temperatures.
</P>
<P>
Tariq Waseem, a 25-year-old student from southwestern Baluchistan
province, walked about 400 kilometres (250 miles) over 10 days
with about a dozen friends in order to be at Saturday's event.
But unlike his friends, he walked barefoot.
</P>
<P>
"These are not painful," he told AFP, pointing with pride at
blisters covering his soles. "These are a gift from my martyred
leader."
</P>
<P>
Local police official Tanvir Odho said about 150,000 mourners had
flocked to the area to pay their respects to Bhutto.
</P>
<P>
Ceremonies are expected to culminate with special prayers at 5:20
pm (1220 GMT) -- about the time Bhutto was attacked.
</P>
<P>
About 7,000 police and paramilitary rangers have fanned out
around the tomb to protect Zardari, who has said he too is a
target for extremists like those who killed Bhutto.
</P>
<P>
"We do not rule out any threat and we have done all things
possible to maintain peace," senior police official Khadim
Hussain Rind told AFP.
</P>
<P>
A special wall has been erected around the mausoleum as part of a
raft of precautions taken to safeguard Zardari. Closed-circuit
cameras have been installed, and mourners were required to pass
through metal detectors.
</P>
<P>
Both Zardari and the United Nations said they hoped a UN
investigation would soon be launched into Bhutto's killing.
Pakistani and US officials have pinned the blame on Taliban
commander Baitullah Mehsud, but he denies any involvement.
</P>
<P>
One year on, Pakistan's reverence for Bhutto continues unabated
-- all television networks ran wall-to-wall Bhutto coverage on
Saturday and the government has issued a 10-rupee coin and stamps
bearing her portrait.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of vendors did a brisk business selling Bhutto
memorabilia -- posters, photographs and recordings of her
speeches -- ahead of the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
The government has declared Saturday a national holiday in
Bhutto's honour, and events were scheduled nationwide.
Candlelight vigils were held late Friday in Rawalpindi and the
southern port city of Karachi.
</P>
<P>
Mohammad Ayaz, 48, from the central city of Multan, sobbed at
Bhutto's graveside, gathering a few flower petals from the pile
of wreaths and arrangements left in her honour.
</P>
<P>
"My children will be blessed when they will touch these petals,"
he said.
