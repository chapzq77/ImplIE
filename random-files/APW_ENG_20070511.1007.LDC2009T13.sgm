SEOUL, South Korea 2007-05-11 15:16:03 UTC

A Seoul court on Friday issued an arrest warrant for a business
tycoon accused of taking part in a sensational revenge attack
after his son was hurt in a karaoke bar fight, officials said.
</P>
<P>
Hanwha Group Chairman and CEO Kim Seung-youn is suspected of
kicking, punching and using a steel pipe to attack bar workers
allegedly involved in a scuffle with his 22-year-old son on March
8 at a karaoke pub.
</P>
<P>
After questioning Kim at a hearing earlier Friday, the Seoul
District Court accepted a prosecution request made on Thursday to
issue an arrest warrant for him, said Hanwha spokesman Ju Cheol-
beom.
</P>
<P>
Judge Lee Kwang-man said the warrant was issued on "concerns that
he may try to destroy evidence," according to Yonhap news agency.
</P>
<P>
Kim, who has been waiting all day at the prosecutors' office for
a court announcement, faces an immediate arrest and will be held
at the Namdaemun Police Station in central Seoul.
</P>
<P>
In a statement released through his company, Kim said he will
"humbly accept the law's judgment."
</P>
<P>
"I plan to explain everything that I know, truthfully and
sincerely," the statement said. "I am very pained and ashamed for
not having been honest for the past two months."
</P>
<P>
Earlier Friday, Kim said he regrets that he "failed to control
impulsive emotion" and apologized for causing trouble.
</P>
<P>
"I hope there will never be a silly father like me again," Kim
told reporters after the court hearing.
</P>
<P>
The dramatic details of the case, which media have likened to a
gangster movie, has drawn intense public interest in South Korea,
where the heads of family controlled conglomerates wield great
economic, political and social clout.
</P>
<P>
The younger Kim, a student at Yale University, reportedly
suffered an injury that required 11 stitches in the scuffle on
stairs outside the karaoke pub.
</P>
<P>
Victims have told police the elder Kim and his bodyguards took
them to a mountainous area south of Seoul, where Kim himself
allegedly assaulted them, including hitting one of them on the
back with a 5-foot (1.5 meter) steel pipe.
</P>
<P>
They have also told police Kim later sought out another man at a
bar in central Seoul and had his son beat him, according to a
police statement.
</P>
<P>
Kim has denied all the allegations.
</P>
<P>
Hanwha was established in 1952 as the Korea Explosives Corp. It
later developed interests in petrochemicals, finance, insurance,
construction and retail. It also owns the Hanwha Eagles
professional baseball team.
</P>
<P>
Kim, South Korea's ninth-richest man, is worth about 900 billion
won (US$971 million; euro720 million), according to Chaebul.com,
a Web site that tracks the fortunes of the conglomerate chiefs
and their families based on current stock prices.
