<P>
Workers at a northern Malaysian airport cargo complex found 2,400
snakes of a protected species in crates bound for Hong Kong sent
by smugglers in Thailand, news reports said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The banded rat snake -- rarely found in Malaysia and protected
under local laws and international wildlife treaties -- is an
expensive delicacy in some Asian countries, the New Straits Times
and The Star reported.
</P>
<P>
Workers handling cargo at the complex near the Bayan Lepas
International Airport in Penang grew suspicious when they heard
hissing and "slithering sounds", the Times reported, and alerted
wildlife officials.
</P>
<P>
The officials found the snakes, worth an estimated 240,000
ringgit (US$68,400; euro52,200) on the market, tied up in plastic
sacks in a total of 86 crates, the Times added.
</P>
<P>
The fate of the snakes was unclear in the reports. Phone calls to
the wildlife department office in Penang went unanswered
Wednesday morning.
