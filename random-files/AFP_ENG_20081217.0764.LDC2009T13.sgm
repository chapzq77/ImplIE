The breakthrough of the Fleet Foxes, the coming of age of TV on
the Radio or the return of Portishead: 2008 was a rich year for
rock, pop and the electronic music scene.
</P>
<P>
Here is a selection of the 10 best albums of the year selected by
AFP.
</P>
<P>
Fleet Foxes, "Fleet Foxes": The revelation of the year. The
Seattle five-piece burst onto the scene with their inventive,
sweet-sounding music that draws from 1960s pop, gospel and folk.
</P>
<P>
TV on the Radio, "Dear Science": A third album from the avant-
gardiste New Yorkers that propelled them from cult heroes to
stardom, with a distinct sound that mixes ambient, electro,
Afrobeat, hard guitar riffs and handclaps.
</P>
<P>
Kanye West, "808s &amp; heartbreak": The American rapper
established himself as the king of hip hop with his fourth album
that borrows from the sounds of the 1980s but still manages to
push his genre forward.
</P>
<P>
Bon Iver, "For Emma, Forever Ago": American Bon Iver (alias
Justin Vernon) recorded his first album in his father's remote
cabin in the woods of north Wisconsin after enduring a traumatic
break-up. A stark album conveying loss and loneliness.
</P>
<P>
The Last Shadow Puppets, "The Age of the Understatement":
Britain's Alex Turner, singer from Arctic Monkeys, and Miles Kane
from The Rascals produced a sumptuous, groove-driven album
stealing unashamedly from the late 1960s.
</P>
<P>
MGMT, "Oracular Spectacular": Wacky young American duo Andrew
VanWyngarden and Ben Goldwasser produced a playful record of
psychedelic rock/electro-pop featuring standout hit "Kids on
French TV".
</P>
<P>
Portishead, "Third": After a decade-long hiatus, the British trio
from Bristol returned with a bristling, experimental album that
moved them on from the trip- hop scene that made them famous in
the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
Santogold, "Santogold": America's Santogold (alias Santi White)
beat stiff competition from singer Erytkah Badu as the best
female artist of the year with her cross-over album mixing rock,
hip hop, reggae et electro.
</P>
<P>
Sebastien Tellier, "Sexuality": The eccentric Frenchman produced
his now- trademark mash-up of R'n'B, electro, pop, and
existentialist angst in his fourth album, produced by one half of
Daft Punk, Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo.
</P>
<P>
Vampire Weekend, "Vampire Weekend": Leading a pack of US indie
rock bands taking an interest in Afrobeat in 2008, these smart
Ivy League graduates made a rich record featuring catchy guitar
riffs, keyboard and string arrangements.
