ANALYSIS: MANY EPISCOPALIANS WARY, SOME DEFIANT AFTER ULTIMATUM
BY ANGLICANS
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There was a time when the Episcopal Church in the United States
was known as "the Republican Party at prayer," but in the last 30
years it has evolved into the Rainbow Coalition of Christianity.
</P>
<P>
There are hip-hop Masses, Native American rituals to install a
new presiding bishop and legions of gay and straight priests who
don the rainbow stoles of gay liberation. Its pews are full of
Roman Catholics and Christians from other traditions attracted by
its aura of radical acceptance.
</P>
<P>
Now the conservatives who numerically dominate the global
Anglican Communion have handed their Episcopal branch in the
United States an ultimatum that requires the church to reel in
the rainbow if it wants to remain a part of the Communion.
</P>
<P>
With a communique issued in Tanzania on Monday after a five-day
meeting, the leaders of Anglican provinces around the world
(known as primates) asked the U.S. branch to bar gays from
becoming bishops, and to stop official blessings of same-sex
unions. The communique even specified a deadline: Sept. 30.
</P>
<P>
There is no certainty at all that Episcopal leaders will now
comply. In interviews on Tuesday, some liberal and moderate
leaders who constitute the church's majority voiced everything
from confusion to serious misgivings to defiance. Many took
umbrage at what they see as meddling by foreign primates who are
imposing their culture and theological interpretations on the
American church.
</P>
<P>
"Being part of the Anglican Communion is very important to me,"
said Bishop Mark S. Sisk of New York. "But if the price of that
is I have to turn my back on the gay and lesbian people who are
part of this church and part of me, I won't do that."
</P>
<P>
On her way home from the meeting in Tanzania, Katharine Jefferts
Schori, the new presiding bishop of the Episcopal Church, wrote
three pages of "Reflections on the Primates Meeting" that were
released late on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Many in her church had been eager to hear her explain why she
signed onto the communique, when she, as much as anyone, is
clearly a product of the church's inclusive rainbow culture. In
her former diocese in Nevada, she allowed the blessing of same-
sex unions and consented to the election of V. Gene Robinson, an
openly gay man, as bishop of New Hampshire in 2003. She is the
first woman to be presiding bishop, and the first woman primate
in the Anglican Communion.
</P>
<P>
In her "reflections," Jefferts Schori struck a tone of respect
for those on both sides: "Both parties hold positions that can be
defended by appeal to our Anglican sources of authority --
scripture, tradition, and reason -- but each finds it very
difficult to understand and embrace the other."
</P>
<P>
She suggested that the struggle for equality for gay men and
lesbians would eventually prevail, just as the slaves in Africa
were eventually freed -- an occasion she and the other primates
commemorated last Sunday at a ceremony at the Cathedral in
Zanzibar, the site of a former slave-trading market.
</P>
<P>
Jefferts Schori concluded by noting that Lent is about to begin,
and said that both sides in this conflict are being asked to
undergo a "season of fasting;" the liberals from blessing same-
sex unions and consecrating gay bishops, and the conservative
primates from "transgressing diocesan boundaries," which is what
happened when some primates from Africa, Asia and Latin America
recently tried taking control of conservative parishes in the
United States that elected to leave the Episcopal Church.
</P>
<P>
Conservatives in the church were also wary about the communique's
plan, but generally far more upbeat than the liberals. The
communique recommends that the Episcopal Church establish new
positions of authority, a council and a "primatial vicar," who
will have oversight of the conservatives within the Episcopal
Church, so they do not have to turn to primates from other
countries.
</P>
<P>
Bishop D. Bruce MacPherson of Western Louisiana, who addressed
the primates in Tanzania on behalf of the conservatives, said of
the communique's recommendations, "I believe it to be the
beginning of a process, a mechanism that will enable us to work
toward healing and reconciliation."
</P>
<P>
He said he expected that the House of Bishops would meet in March
to take up the communique's recommendations, and that the bishops
alone would have the authority to decide whether to accept them.
</P>
<P>
But already there were questions from Episcopalians who said that
such significant decisions as a moratorium on gay bishops and
blessings, and the creation of a council and "primatial vicar"
could not be taken by the House of Bishops alone, but by the
General Convention of the Episcopal Church, which includes lay
and clergy delegates. The General Convention, however, does not
meet this year and is not scheduled for another meeting until
2009.
</P>
<P>
The communique calls for the House of Bishops to "make an
unequivocal common covenant that the bishops will not authorize
any Rite of Blessing for same-sex unions."
</P>
<P>
Some liberals on Tuesday were latching onto what they saw as a
loophole because the wording specifies that the bishops will not
authorize rites. There are many bishops who have not formally
authorized ceremonial rites for gay unions, but who nevertheless
allow priests to perform them. If this is all the communique is
requiring, they suggested, the Episcopal Church can live with
that.
</P>
<P>
"Blessings happen, sure," said Sisk. "But I didn't authorize
them."
</P>
<P>
MacPherson, however, said that his understanding is that the
communique asks the bishops to actually stop the performing of
same-sex blessings in their dioceses.
</P>
<P>
The most despairing reactions came from gay men and lesbians in
the church, who say this is not reconciliation, but capitulation.
</P>
<P>
"They're trying to make people choose between the Communion and
the church's commitment to gay and lesbian people," said the Rev.
Michael Hopkins, a priest in Rochester, N.Y., and the former
president of Integrity, a long-established organization of gay
and lesbian Episcopalians.
</P>
<P>
Although the Episcopal Church is known as an inclusive haven,
Hopkins said, he already knows gay men and lesbians who are
leaving. He said, "People like me can only convince other people
to hang in there for so long."
