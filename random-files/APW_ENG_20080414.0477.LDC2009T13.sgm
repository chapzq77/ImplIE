The governor of Germany's eastern Saxony state announced his
resignation Monday amid turmoil linked to the state's SachsenLB
bank that was battered by its exposure to U.S. subprime
mortgages.
</P>
<P>
Georg Milbradt, 63, has been under pressure since the bank, the
only state-run bank in the former East Germany, announced last
August that it was threatened by its exposure in the U.S. market.
</P>
<P>
The public-sector Landesbank Baden-Wuerttemberg swiftly stepped
in to prevent SachsenLB from going under, but the controversy
continued. The state's finance minister has already quit his job
as a consequence of the bank's floundering.
</P>
<P>
Milbradt, who is a member of Chancellor Angela Merkel's ruling
Christian Democratic Party, also said he was quitting his post as
the head of Saxony's state branch of the party.
