A cold front will drape over Taiwan for about three days

weather forecast Sunday.

CWB meteorologists said that as a result of the cold air mass,
the northern, northeastern and eastern regions of Taiwan, as well
as the offshore islands of Kinmen and Matsu, will see slightly
cooler weather in the next three days, with temperatures slipping
to between 24 and 30 degrees Celsius.

thundershowers over the next three days, with temperatures
ranging from 24 to 33 C.

From Sept. 6 to 8, northeastern and eastern Taiwan will see
additional showers, while central and southern Taiwan will have
thundershowers in their mountainous regions, according to the
