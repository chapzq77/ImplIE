Boxing: Bradley headed for the big time after Witter defeat
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Timothy Bradley has set his sights on becoming the king of the
world's light- welterweights after capturing the WBC belt in
shock split point decision win over Junior Witter.
</P>
<P>
In his first professional fight outside of his native California,
Bradley knocked Witter over in the sixth round and did enough to
claim the World Boxing Council title by judges' decisions of
115-113 and 114-113 for, and 115-112 against.
</P>
<P>
It was a controlled, clever and calculated display from Bradley,
who not only conceded home advantage but ten years to the more
experienced Witter.
</P>
<P>
Englishman Witter looked on the verge of suffering his first
stoppage defeat when Bradley caught him with a looping right.
</P>
<P>
"I always knew I would get to Junior in the second half of the
fight," Bradley told AFP. "He pulls back his chin in the air so I
felt I could throw a counter right and it worked in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
"It’s a punch that I have worked on. I knew the first four rounds
would be hard but through the sixth and seventh rounds I came on.
I knew I had to win it in the second half of the fight."
</P>
<P>
Witter, 34, sank to the canvas in his own corner to take a
mandatory eight count and sensibly avoided any danger by back-
pedalling for the rest of the sixth round.
</P>
<P>
Witter's early control of the fight dissipated and Bradley landed
more blows as the English boxer struggled with his timing.
</P>
<P>
At the end of the fight, Witter looked concerned as to the
outcome and Bradley is now left in line for bigger pay days
against the other world champions in the division -- Andreas
Kotelnik (WBA), Paulie Malignaggi (IBF) and Ricardo Torres (WBO).
</P>
<P>
Bradley, 24, also claimed he is willing to grant Witter a rematch
or face his British rival Ricky Hatton, who is still regarded as
the division's best boxer despite currently not owning one of the
four world title belts.
</P>
<P>
"I love Ricky Hatton and I would love to fight him. If the fight
took place in the USA and the money was right, I would fight
Junior again too," he said.
</P>
<P>
Witter admitted he was not in the sort of form that had seen him
knock out former WBA champion Vivian Harris in September, and
blamed over-training for his poor performance.
</P>
<P>
"My timing and speed just wasn't there. I always thought if I
just turned up I would win, but I didn't turn up.
</P>
<P>
"Getting put down in the sixth cost me the fight, but I still
thought I did enough to win the fight. I was sloppy though and
just couldn’t get my timing right.
</P>
<P>
"I was 70 per cent of what I should have been out there. It had
nothing to do with making the weight, but I never felt great in
the fight and it could be that I overtrained which was why I
wasn't myself.
</P>
<P>
"I've been training for six months non-stop and didn’t take
enough time off."
</P>
<P>
Witter's promoter, Mick Hennessy, will look into the chances of
getting the English boxer a rematch with Bradley later in the
year.
