Venezuela ' s Chavez slams U.S. President George W. Bush on Iraq
war, dismisses concerns

CARACAS, Venezuela 2007-02-01 18:45:16 UTC
</P>
<P>
President Hugo Chavez dismissed Washington's concerns that
Venezuela's democracy is under threat, saying a "dictatorship"
led by U.S. President George W. Bush poses a true threat to
democracy around the world.
</P>
<P>
Condemning the war in Iraq, the Venezuelan leader said that Bush
and John Negroponte, a former director of national intelligence
who is designated for the No. 2 position in the U.S. State
Department, should be tried for "war crimes" committed by the
U.S. military across the globe.
</P>
<P>
"The two of them are criminals. They should be tried and thrown
in prison for the rest of their days," Chavez told a news
conference.
</P>
<P>
"If he had any dignity, the president of the United States would
quit. The U.S. president doesn't have the political or moral
capacity to govern," he added.
</P>
<P>
Chavez was responding to comments made on Wednesday by Bush, who
said he was concerned about Venezuela's democracy.
</P>
<P>
"I am concerned about the undermining of democratic institutions.
And we're working to help prevent that from happening," Bush said
in an interview with Fox News.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Caracas and Washington have been tense
recently, with U.S. officials accusing Chavez -- a close ally of
Cuban leader Fidel Castro -- of becoming increasingly
authoritarian and Chavez accusing U.S. officials of scheming
against his left-leaning government.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Chavez threatened to expel U.S. Ambassador William
Brownfield for "meddling" in Venezuela's domestic affairs.
Brownfield has called for improved relations between the two
countries, but said he's ready to leave if the Chavez
administration decides to expel him.
</P>
<P>
Chavez fiercely denied that his initiative to accelerate changes
in broad areas of Venezuelan society through presidential decree,
which was approved by the pro-Chavez Congress on Wednesday, would
endanger his country's democracy.
</P>
<P>
"The people gave me the power I have, and it's within the
framework of a constitution," Chavez said.
</P>
<P>
Critics have called the measure giving Chavez sweeping powers to
legislate as a move toward dictatorship.
</P>
<P>
The law gives Chavez, who is beginning a fresh six-year term,
more power than he has ever had in eight years as president, and
he plans to use it during the next 18 months to transform this
oil-rich South American nation.
</P>
<P>
Chavez, a former army lieutenant colonel who was re-elected with
63 percent of the vote in December, also announced that his
government would nationalize oil projects in Venezuela's Orinoco
River basin by May 1.
</P>
<P>
Any foreign oil company that resists the nationalization, under
which Venezuela's state oil company Petroleos de Venezuela SA
would take a stake of "no less 60 percent," can leave, Chavez
said.
</P>
<P>
The Venezuelan president said the private companies affected --
British Petroleum PLC, Exxon Mobil Corp., Chevron Corp.,
ConocoPhillips Co., Total SA and Statoil ASA -- would be given
the option to stay on as minority partners in petroleum-rich
region.
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure that they're going to accept this because we are going
to continue being partners. Now, if they aren't in agreement,
they are totally free to leave," he said.
</P>
<P>
The government will also use special decree powers to nationalize
the electricity industry, he said, including Electricidad de
Caracas, an affiliate of the Virginia-based power company AES
Corporation.
</P>
<P>
"One of the first laws will be the one to nationalize the
electricity sector," Chavez said. "It was a mistake to leave that
sector in the hands of local and foreign owned private sector
companies."
