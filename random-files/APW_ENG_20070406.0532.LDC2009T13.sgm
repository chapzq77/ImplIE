The U.S. military issued a statement Friday clarifying that there
were no Iranians in an International Committee of the Red Cross
team who had visited five Iranians in American detention after
they were arrested three months ago in Irbil.

On Wednesday, U.S. military spokesman said Maj. Gen. William
Caldwell said that an ICRC delegation had visited the captive
Iranians and that one of the group was Iranian.

Lt. Col. Christopher Garver, a military spokesman, issued the
clarifying statement Friday in an e-mail statement to The
Associated Press.

"The ICRC committees that visited the five Iranians detained in
Irbil on two occasions did not contain an Iranian national. One
of the two committees contained an individual who speaks Farsi
and lived in Iran, but he is a British citizen by birth," Garver
said.

U.S. Embassy spokesman Lou Fintor, meanwhile, said the United
States was still considering an Iranian government request to
visit the five.

Washington has said the five men, who were arrested in Irbil, the
capital of the Kurdish semiautonomous region in northern Iraq,
were rounded up on suspicion that they were providing aid to
militia fighters who are targeting U.S. and Iraqi troops and
civilians.
