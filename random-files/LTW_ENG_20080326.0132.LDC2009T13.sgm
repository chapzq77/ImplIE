Cable Companies in Talks to Fund WiMax Network
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Comcast and Time Warner Cable are in talks to invest in a
wireless company based on WiMax technology, according to a source
familiar with the talks.
</P>
<P>
The company would be operated by Sprint Nextel and Clearwire,
which have focused over the past year on building a network based
on WiMax, said the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity
because talks are ongoing.
</P>
<P>
With the new company, the cable providers would be taking direct
aim at the nation's biggest wireless carriers, Verizon
Communications and AT&amp;T, which have pushed aggressively into
Internet and television services.
</P>
<P>
Comcast would invest $1 billion and Time Warner would put as much
as $500 million into the venture to create a next-generation,
high-speed wireless network spanning the nation, according to the
source.
</P>
<P>
Comcast and Sprint declined to comment on speculation about the
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Such a venture is part of a race by wireless carriers and cable
companies to become the main source for Internet, phone and
television services, according to Julie Ask, an analyst at
Jupiter Research.
</P>
<P>
Verizon entered into competition with Comcast and Time Warner
Cable through its FiOS fiber-optic network, which offers
television services.
</P>
<P>
"Comcast and Time Warner are home-, broadband- and PC-oriented,
so WiMax as a choice to get into wireless makes sense for them,"
Ask said. "But whether or not they should be their own network or
lease capacity from Sprint or Clearwire is something for Wall
Street analysts to judge."
</P>
<P>
Intel and Google are also involved in the discussions about the
new venture, according to the source. The companies have signaled
their interest in joining with Sprint and Clearwire to form a
WiMax nationwide network.
</P>
<P>
Sprint and Clearwire have been trying to raise $3 billion to
build a WiMax network. Many analysts see WiMax as the biggest bet
for the future for Sprint, which recently moved its headquarters
from Reston, Va., to Overland Park, Kan., in a major
restructuring. Sprint lost 1 million wireless subscribers to
other competitors in the past year.
