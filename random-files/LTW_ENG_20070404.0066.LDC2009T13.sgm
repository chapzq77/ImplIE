HPV: How Much Do You Know?
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Health professionals trying to teach the public about a new
vaccine against human papillomavirus (HPV), a sexually
transmitted virus that causes genital warts and cervical cancer,
say one of their challenges is widespread misinformation about
the virus and the vaccine. Think you know better? Take this true-
false test.
</P>
<P>
1. HPV is a female problem.
</P>
<P>
2. Cervical cancer is primarily a concern for older women.
</P>
<P>
3. If a man uses a condom, neither partner will acquire HPV.
</P>
<P>
4. The chances of getting HPV are slim.
</P>
<P>
5. Only females can be tested for HPV infection.
</P>
<P>
6. The new HPV vaccine called Gardasil is available only for
females.
</P>
<P>
7. HPV is the same thing as herpes.
</P>
<P>
8. The HPV vaccine protects against all forms of cervical cancer.
</P>
<P>
9. The vaccine protects only against cervical cancer.
</P>
<P>
10. The vaccine is not effective if a female is already sexually
active.
</P>
<P>
11. Vaccinating young women against the sexually transmitted
virus is likely to make them more promiscuous.
</P>
<P>
ANSWERS
</P>
<P>
1. False. Both males and females transmit HPV, and both can
become infected. HPV is the leading cause of cervical cancer in
females and may lead to cancer of the vulva and vagina as well.
It is also associated with penile cancer and with anal cancer in
males and females.
</P>
<P>
2. False. Although the median age for cervical cancer diagnosis
is 48, it has been detected in females as young as 17. A recent
national study showed that among females 14 to 59, 2 percent were
infected with two cancer-causing strains of HPV.
</P>
<P>
3. False. Although latex condoms, if used consistently, can
reduce the risk of infection by as much as 70 percent, HPV can
still be transmitted from an infected partner. The virus is
transmitted skin to skin, not through bodily fluids. Infection
can occur in both male and female genitals and in the area
surrounding the genitals such as the inner thighs.
</P>
<P>
4. False. At least half of sexually active people will acquire
genital HPV virus in their lifetime. By age 50, at least 80
percent of females will have been infected. Most infections clear
up on their own.
</P>
<P>
5.True, at least for now. Females are tested during their regular
Pap smear or if they have genital warts, which can be treated and
are not life-threatening. And a DNA test for HPV is also
available.
</P>
<P>
6. True, although a male vaccine is in development.
</P>
<P>
7. False. Herpes (HSV) differs from HPV; it does not cause the
same symptoms or pose the same health problems.
</P>
<P>
8. False. About 70 percent of cervical cancers can be prevented
by the vaccine.
</P>
<P>
9. False. The vaccine has been found to be about 90 percent
effective in preventing genital warts and may provide some
protection against precancers of the vulva, vagina and cervix.
</P>
<P>
10. False. Sexually active females may benefit, though not as
much as females who are not yet sexually active.
</P>
<P>
11. False. There is no evidence that vaccination has any effect
on behavior.
