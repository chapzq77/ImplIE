KLITSCHKO ENJOYS TRAINING AT A SOUTH FLORIDA GOLF COURSE

PALM BEACH GARDENS, Fla. -- This is a place where business is
done on the links and relaxation is an all-day activity.
</P>
<P>
Where the only moment of violence is a golf club tossed on a
quiet championship course.
</P>
<P>
But it is here that a monument to boxing stands in a parking lot
next to the spa.
</P>
<P>
Peak inside the white tent and see a 6-foot-6 Ukrainian nicknamed
"Dr. Steelhammer" throw a barrage of punches. He doesn't need a
9-iron for these rounds.
</P>
<P>
Wladimir Klitschko, the No. 1 heavyweight in the world, is
holding training camp at PGA National Resort &amp;amp; Spa, where
Sugar Ray Leonard trained 12 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Anyone who wants to see Klitschko hurl a medicine ball or hurt a
heavy bag can have a seat on a folding chair and watch.
</P>
<P>
"We have all the people in the gym. It gives spirit to the gym,"
Klitschko said. "Athletes are artists. The ring is the stage. We
need an audience. ... This is perfect."
</P>
<P>
Klitschko (49-3) is preparing for a title-unification bout Feb.
23 at Madison Square Garden against Russian Sultan Ibragimov (22
</P>
<P>
1), who lives in Hallandale Beach and is training in Pompano
Beach.
</P>
<P>
That's two fighters from the old Soviet bloc working out a county
apart in South Florida.
</P>
<P>
Klitschko's trainer, HBO commentator and legendary cornerman
Emmanuel Steward, said it's no surprise.
</P>
<P>
"Florida is the training capital of the world," said Steward, who
lives in Detroit. He has worked training camps for Lennox Lewis,
Michael Moorer and Jermain Taylor in South Florida.
</P>
<P>
Steward said boxers are drawn to Florida for an obvious reason.
</P>
<P>
"Boxers don't want to worry about slipping and falling on ice
when they're running," he said. "Or catching a cold in the cold."
</P>
<P>
Klitschko takes no chances. On a recent chilly day he brought
heat lamps for the tent.
</P>
<P>
"Our guests are enjoying the fact we have the heavyweight working
out in the parking lot," said James Gelfand, vice president of
sales and marketing at PGA National. "We're thrilled to play in a
different world."
</P>
<P>
He said boxing fits in with the resort's effort to be more hip.
Many guests, he said, appreciate the glamorous side of the sport.
</P>
<P>
Friday night, the resort will host its first boxing show in its
840-seat ballroom. The card features local fighters from local
gyms, not the big names training in the tent.
</P>
<P>
Klitschko, 31, will risk his IBF and IBO heavyweight titles when
he faces Ibragimov, 32, who holds the WBO belt.
</P>
<P>
Klitschko is enjoying his training here, where he is surrounded
by members of his team.
</P>
<P>
"The camp represents more than just training for a fighter,"
Steward said. "It's friends and family getting together."
</P>
<P>
At his temporary home here, Klitschko has a full-time cook. But
the fighter also grills lamb chops marinated in wine for his
entourage.
</P>
<P>
He typically trains in the Poconos in Pennsylvania but decided to
come here after a conversation about golf at Oktoberfest in his
adopted hometown of Hamburg, Germany.
</P>
<P>
His pal, Jurgen Rassman, whose company does marketing for PGA
National, was raving about the resort.
</P>
<P>
Soon enough, Klitschko wanted to train in the same time zone as
New York in a city with boxing fans, fair weather and a suitable
gym. Rassman, who has lived at PGA National for 20 years,
arranged for a tent and Klitschko moved in three weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
"It is logic. Conditions here are perfect," Klitschko said.
</P>
<P>
He has not golfed, though, because he says he is a 36 handicap
and can't tolerate the daylong depression a round would bring.
But Steward, 63, played for the first time in his life Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Steward also is working with 10th-ranked cruiserweight Jonathan
Banks and undefeated Irish middleweight Andy Lee in the PGA
National tent.
</P>
<P>
The tent has a ring, a heavy bag, a full-length mirror and three
flat-screen TVs on which Klitschko watches a constant rotation of
Ibragimov's past wins.
</P>
<P>
Klitschko works out to Salt-N-Pepa's "Push It" and attempts to
dance to Tone Loc's "Wild Thing" in between grueling rounds.
</P>
<P>
Klitschko designs his own workout routine, having earned a Ph.D.
in sports science (hence the nickname "Doctor").
</P>
<P>
Despite being 245 pounds of solid muscle, there are no weights
here.
</P>
<P>
"We train the old-fashioned way," Steward said. "Beat the bags,
do the sit-ups. Box."
</P>
<P>
Visitors from Seattle and Cleveland and Lancaster, Pa., stop by
with golf bags draped over their shoulders to gawk at the athlete
they variously describe as "Drago" (from "Rocky IV"), "Robo-Cop"
and "Terminator."
</P>
<P>
Carol Mazanec of Jupiter Island was curious about the tent and
impressed when she learned who was inside.
</P>
<P>
"I'm a big boxing fan. I'm going to be here every day," she said.
"Last week I went to Palm Meadows and watched the thoroughbreds
work out. He's much more physical."
