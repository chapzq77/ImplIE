after suffering organ failure

Former Indonesian dictator Suharto showed slight signs of
improvement, doctors said Saturday, a day after he suffered organ
failure and was placed on a ventilator with dangerous signs of
infection in his lungs.
</P>
<P>
Physicians described his condition as "alarming" Friday, and
family members and friends rushed to his bedside, some reciting
prayers and verses from the Quran as he started to lose
consciousness.
</P>
<P>
Health Minister Siti Fadilah Supari said she was pessimistic,
telling El-Shinta radio the ventilator was a "last attempt" by
doctors to keep him alive. "I don't think it will help," she
said.
</P>
<P>
But chief presidential doctor Marjo Subiandono said there were
signs of improvement overnight.
</P>
<P>
"Generally, his condition is better," he said, adding while
Suharto remained on a ventilator, antibiotics appeared to be
having an effect on his infected lungs. "He's more aware,
responsive."
</P>
<P>
Suharto's blood pressure was also stable, Subiandono said, though
there was some bleeding in the stomach.
</P>
<P>
Suharto, whose regime was widely regarded as one of the 20th
century's most brutal and corrupt, was hospitalized in critical
condition one week ago with anemia and a low heart rate. He
initially responding well to a blood transfusion and kidney
dialysis, but days later his condition sharply deteriorated.
</P>
<P>
The retired five-star general was ousted in 1998 amid massive
student protests and nationwide riots, opening the way for
democracy in this predominantly Muslim nation of 235 million
people. He withdrew from public life, venturing from his
comfortable villa on a leafy lane in the capital only to attend
family functions or for medical emergencies.
</P>
<P>
A series of strokes in recent years have left Suharto with
permanent brain damage and impaired speech -- keeping him from
facing trial. He has been accused of overseeing a purge of more
than a half-million leftist opponents soon after seizing power in
a 1965 coup. Hundreds of thousands more were killed or imprisoned
in the decades that followed -- crimes for which no one has ever
been punished.
</P>
<P>
Transparency International says Suharto and his family also
amassed billions of dollars in state funds -- an allegation he
has denied.
</P>
<P>
Aids said privately that Suharto appeared to be on the verge of
death late Friday, and Health Minister Supari told El-Shinta she
strongly advised doctors against placing him on a ventilator.
</P>
<P>
She said he should be allowed to die in peace.
</P>
<P>
Family members, however, decided to go ahead.
</P>
<P>
A member of Suharto's medical team, Joko Raharjo, said the former
dictator was conscious early Saturday and nodded when spoken to.
His organs appeared to be functioning better, even though there
was still some fluid buildup.
</P>
<P>
"This morning the team of doctors will try to improve his general
condition by giving him a blood transfusion and medicine to
continue fighting the infection in his lungs and to balance his
body fluid," said Subiandono, the other doctor.
