18 years on, Tiananmen overshadows Olympics: rights group
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Almost 18 years after the Tiananmen Square massacre, a top rights
group said Friday that the official Chinese government line on
the crackdown was overshadowing next year's Beijing Olympic
Games.
</P>
<P>
"China's total failure to account for the massacre of June 4,
1989 casts a pall on its efforts to project a new image and
continues to spawn more abuses," New York-based Human Rights
Watch said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The group accused Beijing of harassing survivors, their families
and those who challenged what it called the official "whitewash"
of events and said the Chinese government had failed to bring
justice to the victims of the massacre.
</P>
<P>
"What kind of Olympic host marks the annual anniversary of a
brutal massacre by persecuting victims' families and detaining
dissidents?" asked the watchdog's deputy Asia director Sophie
Richardson.
</P>
<P>
"Beijing -- and by extension, the 2008 Olympic Games -- will
remain tarnished by this legacy until the Chinese government
provides a complete and truthful account of what happened in June
1989," she said.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds, perhaps thousands of unarmed protesters were killed by
military units when the government sent in the troops to end six
weeks of pro-democracy protests. It remains one of the most
sensitive political issues in China.
</P>
<P>
Human Rights Watch repeated its call for Beijing to overturn a
decision labeling the incident a "counter-revolutionary
rebellion" and to give fair and open trials to all those
convicted over the protests.
</P>
<P>
It also wants the Chinese government to issue a list of all those
killed and called on Beijing to stop persecuting those who were
demanding justice and to prosecute those responsible for the
violence.
</P>
<P>
"In the 14 months leading up to the Beijing Olympics, the Chinese
Communist Party wants to be seen as a modern, sophisticated
nation, one governed by the rule of law," Richardson said.
</P>
<P>
"But the image the world should not forget is that of a
courageous individual facing down a column of tanks, as his fate
and that of thousands of other protestors remain unresolved."
</P>
<P>
Beijing has repeatedly dismissed suggestions that hundreds of
people were killed in the crackdown, insisting that its handling
of the protest was necessary to ensure China's economic growth
and stability.
