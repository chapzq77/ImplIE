US doubts Iranians have many 'political choices' in polls
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The United States raised doubts about whether Iranians had a
"full menu of political choices" in Friday's parliamentary
elections, but declined to pronounce them unfair.
</P>
<P>
"I don't know anything about turnout," State Department spokesman
Sean McCormack told reporters when asked to comment on the
elections and voter turnout.
</P>
<P>
"One thing I'd note though is the fact that the government had a
heavy hand in deciding who could and could not run raises some
questions about whether or not the Iranian people had a full menu
of political choices available to them in this election,"
McCormack said.
</P>
<P>
"Then again that is not something that is new. There have been
plenty of past instances in Iran where the government has
summarily scratched names of potential candidates off the list,
telling them they couldn't run for office."
</P>
<P>
Ahead of the vote, Iranian reformists have expressed fury that
hundreds of their candidates were disqualified in vetting for the
polls while conservatives have accused leading moderates of being
too close to the West.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether he could rule out any chance that the elections
would be fair, McCormack replied: "I guess we'll have to wait for
input from my other colleagues before I have something more to
stay about it."
</P>
<P>
White House spokeswoman Dana Perino said Wednesday the
administration had "very low expectations" for the elections,
saying the results were unlikely to reflect the people's will.
</P>
<P>
She spoke after Iran's leaders urged voters to send a defiant
message to the West by participating massively in Friday's
elections after a muted campaign expected to consolidate hardline
control of parliament.
</P>
<P>
Iran's leadership has been keen to minimize political divisions
and make a show of national unity amid the tensions over the
Iranian atomic drive, which Washington charges is an
unacknowledged effort to develop nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
Last week the UN Security Council tightened sanctions against
Tehran over its refusal to heed the world body's calls to freeze
uranium enrichment, a potential weapons-making process.
</P>
<P>
Iran analyst Karim Sadjadpour told AFP the latest resolution's
"goal was to send a signal to Iranian voters" on Friday to chose
"more pragmatic and moderate officials" who can end Iran's
isolation and economic malaise.
</P>
<P>
State Department deputy spokesman Tom Casey appeared to say as
much last week, though he did not actually mention the elections.
</P>
<P>
"I would hold to you that there are political consequences in
that system for that failure, that fundamental failure of
President Ahmedinejad and his (group) to live up to that basic
commitment that they made to their people when they were
elected," Casey said.
