Arab League chief urges rival Lebanese leaders to resume dialogue
</HEADLINE>

BEIRUT, Lebanon 2007-06-23 00:11:45 UTC

<P>
The head of the Arab League pressed Lebanon's feuding leaders to
resume dialogue to resolve the country's deepening political
crisis after failing to mediate such an agreement himself.
</P>
<P>
Wrapping up four days of talks with rival Lebanese factions, Arab
League Secretary-General Amr Moussa said the agenda for the
proposed dialogue should include three main topics: the formation
of a national unity government; the election of a new president
to succeed President Emile Lahoud, whose term expires in
November; and the preservation of Lebanon's security and
stability in the face of a spate of bombings and assassinations.
</P>
<P>
Moussa said at a press conference Friday that "remaining
obstacles" prevented an agreement to restart talks based on the
proposed agenda during his visit, but did not provide further
details.
</P>
<P>
A Cabinet member said Moussa's mission ended in "total failure"
after the Hezbollah-led opposition rejected his proposal.
</P>
<P>
"The opposition, at Syria's instructions, scuttled the Arab
League mission to resume national dialogue," Telecommunications
Minister Marwan Hamadeh told The Associated Press late Friday.
</P>
<P>
Hamadeh, a leading anti-Syrian politician, said that while all
pro-government groups had agreed to Moussa's three-point proposal
to resume dialogue, the opposition rejected it.
</P>
<P>
Members of the Syria-backed opposition could not immediately be
reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon is facing its most serious political crisis since the end
of the 1975-90 civil war, with the Western-backed government and
the Hezbollah-led opposition locked in a fierce power struggle.
Rival Lebanese politicians have not met since a national dialogue
conference ended last year without agreement.
</P>
<P>
The crisis has taken on an increasingly sectarian tone and has
erupted into street clashes between supporters of pro- and anti-
government factions in recent months, killing 11 people.
</P>
<P>
One of the opposition's key demands is the creation of a new
national unity government in which it has veto power. The
existing government has so far resisted such a move.
</P>
<P>
A political crisis is looming over the presidency as well. The
legislature must vote on a replacement for pro-Syrian Lahoud, but
it is highly unlikely that Lebanon's divided leaders can agree on
a candidate -- threatening a power vacuum, or even worse the
creation of two rival governments.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon has also been shaken by a string of bombings and
assassinations in the past two years targeting mainly anti-Syrian
politicians and journalists.
</P>
<P>
The latest victim was anti-Syrian lawmaker Walid Eido, who was
killed along with his son, two bodyguards and six passers-by last
week in a car bombing in Beirut.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese army has also been battling al-Qaida-inspired
militants barricaded in a Palestinian refugee camp in northern
Lebanon for over a month.
</P>
<P>
"There is a chance for all (parties) to sit together and reach an
understanding on the country's problems," Moussa said.
</P>
<P>
"Dialogue is a right, a duty and is in the interest of all the
Lebanese," he said. "The absence of dialogue harms Lebanon's
interest."
</P>
<P>
Without setting a date for the proposed dialogue, Moussa said
such meetings should be held within "a definite time."
</P>
<P>
He said the proposed agenda for the dialogue provided "elements"
for a solution to the political crisis.
</P>
<P>
He said the Arab League would continue its efforts, including
contacts with regional and international powers, to help the
Lebanese reach a solution to the crisis. Moussa, leading an Arab
League delegation, arrived here Tuesday in an attempt to help
rival politicians end the monthslong political crisis.
</P>
<P>
Parliament is not functioning and the government just barely,
after a quarter of Cabinet members resigned. Opposition
supporters have been holding a sit-in outside Prime Minister Fuad
Saniora's office since Dec. 1, calling for his resignation and
the formation of a new government.
</P>
<P>
Saniora, backed by the anti-Syrian parliamentary majority, the
United States and the West, has refused to step down.
</P>
<P>
Moussa said he would soon hold talks with Syria, which strongly
supports the opposition's demand for a new government.
</P>
<P>
The Arab League delegation was dispatched to Beirut after a
foreign ministers' meeting in Cairo last week in the wake of
Eido's assassination, which his supporters blamed on Syria.
