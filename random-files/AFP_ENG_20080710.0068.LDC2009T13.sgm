Bush signs wiretapping law
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
US President George W. Bush Thursday signed a law expanding legal
authority for wiretaps by spy agencies which he hailed as vital
for America's security, after a fierce Congress battle."This law
will play a critical role in helping to prevent another attack on
our soil," Bush said as he signed the bill, calling it "vital to
the security of our people."
</P>
<P>
"The bill will allow our intelligence professionals to quickly
and effectively monitor the communications of terrorists abroad
while respecting the liberties of Americans here at home," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The law includes retroactive immunity for telecommunications
firms which aided warrantless government surveillance operations
following the September 11 attacks in 2001, meeting a key White
House demand.
</P>
<P>
The bill had sparked fierce debate between civil liberties
advocates who argue it eroded checks on the power of government
and intelligence officials who feared the row was compromising
their power to thwart terror attacks.
</P>
<P>
Senators finally voted Wednesday 69 to 28 to pass the measure,
after blocking several attempts to water down the immunity for
telecom firms.
</P>
<P>
"Almost seven years have passed since that September morning when
nearly 3,000 men, women, and children were murdered in our
midst," Bush said.
</P>
<P>
"The attack changed our country forever. We realized America was
a nation at war. Against a ruthless and persistent enemy."
</P>
<P>
The president added: "The most important lessons learned after
9/11 was that America's intelligence professionals lack some of
the tools they needed to monitor the communications of terrorists
abroad.
</P>
<P>
"It's essential that our intelligence committee know who our
enemies are talking to, what they're saying, and what they're
planning."
</P>
<P>
After the September 11 attacks, Bush authorized the National
Security Agency to eavesdrop on calls and emails between the
United States and abroad in cases that federal agents deemed may
have a terror link.
</P>
<P>
The wiretaps went ahead without the permission of a special court
set up to watch over government wiretapping operations inside the
United States, provided for under the Foreign Intelligence
Surveillance Act (FISA) of 1978.
</P>
<P>
The program, revealed in 2005, caused public outcry and opponents
argued that US privacy guarantees meant the intelligence agencies
should seek court warrants from the FISA court to conduct such
spying inside the country.
</P>
<P>
The new law says the FISA court mechanism is the only way the
government can order electronic surveillance of terror suspects.
</P>
<P>
The 1978 law allowed the ultra-secretive National Security Agency
to wiretap for 72 hours while waiting for the FISA court to
approve the action.
</P>
<P>
The new law, however, gives the agency a week, and it also allows
them to use any information they got even if the FISA court
eventually rules that the wiretap is unlawful.
