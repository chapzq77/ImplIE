Recent comments by the Senegal's President Abduolaye Wade and
other senior politicians suggest they want to increase
censorship, media watchdog Reporters Without Borders (RSF) said
Wednesday.

"The repeated scathing comments about the independent media can
only aggravate the climate of hostility between the press and
government," RSF Africa said in a statement from Dakar.
</P>
<P>
"We urge the Senegalese authorities to respect the work of the
media and allow the media regulatory body to do its job," it
added.
</P>
<P>
The group cited comments by Wade during a recent visit to the
United States, when asked about the police beating of two
journalists in Senegal following a football match in June.
</P>
<P>
Asked if he was prepared to condemn the attack, he blamed the
journalists for the incident and went on to suggest that most
journalists were corrupt, said RSF.
</P>
<P>
The group also mentioned a call by Air Transport Minister Farba
Senghor for members of the ruling PDS party members to boycott
pro-opposition media.
</P>

Senghor, a close ally of president Abduolaye Wade and a leading
PDS member, made the comments during on a news broadcast on
Senegal's RTS state television.

RSF said he had also called on government and state-owned
enterprises to suspend all advertising contracts with such media.
