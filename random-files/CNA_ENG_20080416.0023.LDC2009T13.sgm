Panama's first lady Vivian Fernandez de Torrijos extended her
gratitude Tuesday to Taiwan for its contributions to several
social welfare programs in Panama, including the construction of
elementary schools and water conduits.
</P>
<P>
The Panamanian first lady expressed her thanks at a ceremony at
the Presidential Office during which Republic of China Ambassador
Hou Ping-fu pledged funding for the projects on behalf of the ROC
government.
</P>
<P>
Hou noted that the projects, which also include the construction
of highways and the expansion of a football stadium, are all
examples of bilateral cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Once the highways are completed, Hou said, the agricultural
produce grown in rural villages can be easily transported and
sold in urban areas, while the hospital that Taiwan promised to
help build in eastern Panama Province will greatly benefit the
poor in that area.

<P>
According to the first lady, President Martin Torrijos will have
constructed 108 elementary schools in rural areas before he steps
down in August next year, which have improved significantly the
level of education in poorer regions.
</P>
<P>
As to the football stadium Rommel Fernandez in Panama City, which
Taiwan has helped to expand, First Vice President Samuel Lewis
said that it will be able to accommodate some 40,000 people,
double the original 20,000 capacity, once the construction work
is completed and be suitable for international matches.
