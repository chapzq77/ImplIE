Microsoft Corp.'s fiscal third-quarter profit jumped 65 percent,
buoyed by sales of its new versions of Windows and Office and by
upgrade coupons for the operating system issued over the
holidays.
</P>
<P>
Earnings for the quarter ended March 31 rose to $4.93 billion
(euro3.63 billion), or 50 cents per share, from $2.98 billion
(euro2.19 billion), or 29 cents per share in same period last
year.
</P>
<P>
Results included legal charges amounting to 1 cent per share, but
tax benefits boosted profit by 2 cents per share.
</P>
<P>
Analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial forecast a profit of 46
cents per share.
</P>
<P>
Revenue for the quarter rose 32 percent to $14.4 billion
(euro10.59 billion). Wall Street was looking for $13.89 billion
(euro10.22 billion) in sales.
</P>

Microsoft started selling its newest operating system, Windows
Vista, to consumers at the end of January. Its "client" division,
responsible for Windows, brought in $5.27 billion (euro3.88
billion) in sales, 67 percent higher than a year ago.
</P>
<P>
Analysts estimate Microsoft deferred $1 billion (euro0.74
billion) to $1.5 billion (euro1.1 billion) in Windows Vista
revenue to the third quarter, to account for upgrade coupons
given to PC buyers during the holiday season, before the consumer
launch of the new operating system.
</P>
<P>
Microsoft Chief Financial Officer Chris Liddell said the
"excellent quarter" was because of better-than-expected sales of
Vista and Office.
</P>
<P>
Liddell said Vista beat internal forecasts by $300 million
(euro220.65 million) to $400 million (euro294.2 million), and
Office 2007 sales were $200 million (euro147.1 million) better
than expected.
</P>
<P>
The client division sales "are surprisingly ahead of where we
thought they would come in," said Sid Parakh, an analyst at
McAdams Wright Ragen. "They might indicate Vista is doing fine."
</P>
<P>
Microsoft's entertainment and devices division, which includes
the Xbox 360 game console and the Zune music player, posted a 21
percent drop in sales to $929 million (euro683.29 million).
</P>
<P>
Liddell said the company is still on track to sell 1 million
Zunes this fiscal year, and reach the 12 million mark in Xbox 360
units sold since the product hit store shelves.
</P>
<P>
Microsoft trails Google Inc. and Yahoo Inc. in making money from
Web searches, but online services revenue edged up 11 percent to
$653 million (euro480.29 million) in the quarter. Online
advertising revenue grew 23 percent year-over-year, Liddell said.
</P>
<P>
"Monetization of search is increasing with our new AdCenter
platform," said the CFO. "It's still a small base, but it's
growing very well."
</P>
<P>
The client division sales "are surprisingly ahead of where we
thought they would come in," said Sid Parakh, an analyst at
McAdams Wright Ragen. "They might indicate Vista is doing fine."
