US yet to ask Turkey to let hospital ships through: embassy

Washington has made no formal request from Ankara to allow two US
hospital ships to sail through the Turkish Straits to Georgia, a
US diplomat said Saturday, following reports that Turkey was
dragging its feet on making a decision."The United States is
considering a lot of actions" to help Georgia amid its conflict
with Russia over South Ossetia, the spokeswoman of the US embassy
in Ankara, Kathy Schallow, told AFP.

"But as far as I know, we have not made a formal decision about
sending those two ships," she said, adding that "a formal
request" for their passage through the Dardanelles and Bosphorus
straits was not made either.

Turkish foreign ministry officials were not available for
comment.

General James Cartwright, vice chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of
Staff, said Friday that Washington's plans called for sending two
US Navy hospital ships to Georgia, among other assistance.

Unnamed US officials told McClatchy Newspapers that the two
hospital ships likely to go -- the Comfort and the Mercy -- would
take weeks to arrive and complained that Turkey was "sluggish and
unresponsive" in granting them a permission to sail through the
straits to the Black Sea.

Turkey's NTV news channel reported Saturday that the two ships'
tonnage exceeded the limits set by the 1936 Montreux Convention,
which governs international traffic through the Bosphorus and
Dardanelles straits.
