Shareholders in British consulting firm Axon Group PLC have
agreed to accept a 650 pence ($9.78) a share cash offer from
India's HCL Technologies Ltd, company officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
HCL chief executive Vineet Nayar said the economic downturn had
only made the acquisition more attractive.
</P>
<P>
"The deal is significantly more attractive to us today than it
was yesterday," he said.
</P>
<P>
Axon operates in defensive sectors, like utilities, where HCL
doesn't have a strong presence, he said. Moreover, HCL was able
to snap up just over 10 percent of Axon shares on the open
market, at below the offer price, he said.
</P>
<P>
Nayar said the final price of the deal -- initially pegged at 441
million pounds ($662 million) -- would be finalized pending court
approval, expected Dec. 15.
</P>
<P>
Until then, he said "there is still a possibility of a second
bidder."
</P>
<P>
The shareholder vote to accept HCL's offer was nearly unanimous,
he said.
</P>
<P>
The acquisition -- the largest by an Indian IT company -- comes
at a time of difficulty for India's information technology
sector, which depends heavily on U.S. financial services firms
that have been hit hard by the credit crisis.
</P>
<P>
HCL trumped an earlier offer by India's Infosys Technologies Ltd,
offering to buy Axon shares at an 8.3 percent premium to the
Infosys bid.
