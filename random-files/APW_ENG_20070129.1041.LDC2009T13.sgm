Secularism put to task in French hospitals

A young Muslim slaps the chief of a Paris maternity ward because
the doctor manually examined his wife. The case is unusual
because it went to court, but the violence is not.
</P>
<P>
A report issued Monday by a government-appointed panel
recommended that France adopt a charter to keep religious
traditions and beliefs out of its hospitals and other
institutions, to avoid cases like that of the 23-year-old Muslim
convicted last week.
</P>
<P>
Far softer than a 2004 law that banned Muslim head scarves and
other "ostentatious" religious signs from public classrooms, the
proposed charter is, like the head scarf law, an effort to ensure
the secular nature of France.
</P>
<P>
Tensions over religious beliefs in French hospitals, prisons and
elsewhere have mounted in recent years, particularly as Muslim
fundamentalists find a voice. With an estimated 5 million
Muslims, Islam is the second religion in France.
</P>
<P>
Plans to draw the line on what is considered unacceptable
behavior in hospitals, carrying risks for patients, were first
raised three years ago during the debate over Muslim head
scarves. Then-Prime Minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin said that
hospitals were the next target.
</P>
<P>
In May, Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin asked the High
Council on Integration to prepare recommendations to ensure
secularism in public institutions. It submitted its proposal for
a charter on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Male doctors, particularly in maternity wards, say they are
increasingly subject to insults, even blows, most often by men
opposed to nudity or physical contact with their wives and
daughters.
</P>
<P>
The conviction last week of Fouhad Ben Moussa highlighted the
issue. He pulled Jean-Francois Oury, the head of the maternity
ward of Robert Debre Hospital in Paris, from a hospital room in
September and slapped him after the doctor manually examined his
wife, who had hemorrhaged after giving birth, according to court
testimony.
</P>
<P>
"In my religion, a man doesn't touch a woman," Ben Moussa
screamed, according to the testimony. In court, Ben Moussa,
expressing regret, said his real motivation was modesty, not
religion. Still, he was sentenced to a six-month jail term which
can be served in part at home.
</P>
<P>
"I think the Oury case was the straw that broke the camel's
back," said Emile Darai, secretary general of the National
Congress of French Gynecologists and Obstetricians.
</P>
<P>
The group, unusually, issued a statement in October asking, "Do
gynecologists and obstetricians now need police protection to
practice?"
</P>
<P>
The statement affirmed that male and female doctors would treat
patients "whatever their sex," and said it was the woman who has
freedom "to determine contraception, abortion, sterilization
without the opinion of her husband."
</P>
<P>
The experts recommending a charter for public institutions
measured their words, affirming the rights of patients, but
stressing the need for a "balanced approach."
</P>
<P>
The report said there was no need to legislate on the issue, but
stressed that respect for the functioning of the hospital was
vital. It suggested a charter laying out the constitutionally
guaranteed principle of secularism be adopted and that pertinent
sections be posted at the relevant institutions.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the charter would be distributed at key events, such
as the conferring of citizenship on immigrants.
