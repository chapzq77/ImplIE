DETROIT, BUCKLING UNDER REPEATED BLOWS, TAKES ANOTHER HIT NICK

DETROIT
</P>
<P>
Motown left years ago. The city's former mayor is behind bars.
Unemployment hovers around 14 percent. An emergency loan measure
for its automakers died in Washington late Thursday after failing
to generate enough support from Republican senators. Oh, and its
professional football team is 0-13 for the season.
</P>
<P>
How much more, one wonders, can Detroit take?
</P>
<P>
"To me, it's like piling on," Gail Taylor, one of the city's
legions of unemployed men, said Friday of the Senate's decision
on the loan measure. "We've been through enough around here."
</P>
<P>
Taylor, 59, was killing time at Campus Martius, a town-square-
like meeting place in the heart of downtown. Clad in a hooded
gray sweatshirt and a leather jacket, he sipped hot chocolate
near the area's festively decorated 65-foot Norway spruce tree.
</P>
<P>
"The last person to leave Detroit should turn out the lights,
because if it turns out the automakers don't get the money,
there's going to be devastation all around," he said, shaking his
head as snowflakes swirled about. "From our restaurants to the
hair salons to the shoeshine parlors, the fall of the automakers
will affect us all one way or another."
</P>
<P>
James Greenwood, 54, a former auto plant worker taking a break
from his job as a maintenance worker at nearby Cobo Center, where
the North American International Auto Show will be held this
winter, huddled with friends around the Campus Martius ice
skating rink. The Senate's decision, he said, surprised him.
</P>
<P>
"I thought they would help the industry because they should know
how many people would be affected if they didn't," Greenwood said
with a mixture of fatalism and hope.
</P>
<P>
"We've been suffering here for a long time now," he said, but in
the next breath he held out hope that automakers would get some
financial relief from the Treasury and the federal Troubled Asset
Relief Program.
</P>
<P>
"You never know," Greenwood said, turning his collar up against
the freezing temperature, "somebody in Washington could come to
their senses. They could get enough to get through this year. In
the long run, though, I think they'll punt it to Obama."
</P>
<P>
Latrice Jackson, however, had little sympathy for Detroit's
automakers, or its workers.
</P>
<P>
"I just feel like we all need to buckle down, and stop being so
greedy," said Jackson, who lives in suburban Ferndale and takes
care of her disabled brother. "The companies should have seen all
of this coming, but they brought it on themselves. And a lot of
the workers, well, we all have to learn to get by with less. We
need to stop hoarding things, and take better care of our money."
</P>
<P>
Across the street, the popular 91-year-old American Coney Island
restaurant was doing brisk business, with folks streaming in to
take refuge from the cold, and to talk about the car industry.
</P>
<P>
"Honey, the Big Three is Detroit," a waitress, Cindy Williams,
46, said. "We get all kinds of business from auto workers. "If
the companies don't get money, Detroit is done for."
</P>
<P>
Donald J. Andrews, having lunch near steamy windows with a table
of friends, said the Senate's action "was a big mistake" that
would have severe consequences.
</P>
<P>
"As far as I'm concerned, the automotive industry is the arsenal
of democracy," said Andrews, 43, a lawyer from Waterford, about a
half-hour drive from here.
</P>
<P>
Another lawyer, Jeffrey Schwartz, 53, of the suburb of West
Bloomfield, was incredulous that, as he put it, "the government
is for bankers and Wall Street, and then makes the decision not
to support this industry."
</P>
<P>
The restaurant's general manager, Dan Keros, agreed that it was
the government's job to lend the auto industry a hand.
</P>
<P>
"Saving workers' jobs is every American's duty; it's what the
government should have done," said Keros, 62, of Grosse Pointe,
who wore a baseball cap colored like an American flag.
</P>
<P>
Overhearing the conversation, a well-known community activist,
Malik Shabazz, 46, yelled from a nearby table, "Bail out the
people, not the banks!" Between bites of a trademark Detroit
chili dog -- a steamed hot dog slathered with onions, chili and
mustard -- Shabazz went on:
</P>
<P>
"Give the banks money? No problem. But the car companies, man,
they had to do flips, and they didn't get a dime."
</P>
<P>
A local sports radio station dedicated the entire day to
"standing up" for the auto industry with messages of hope from
people like Detroit's new mayor, Kenneth V. Cockrel Jr., and
other politicians.
</P>
<P>
Stores, too, joined the campaign. John Hiller, the chief
executive of Hiller's Markets, a favorite of the area's Asian
residents, felt the need to blog about the importance of buying
American. "These cars have a long, illustrious history, its own
history," he wrote, "for we come from a place of innovation."
</P>
<P>
Thoughts of persistence more than innovation seemed to be the
focus of many people like Ronald Williams, 32, a student at Wayne
County Community College who was waiting for a bus to take him
home.
</P>
<P>
"We're all just going to have to keep on keeping on," Williams
said. "Around here, that's all we know how to do."
