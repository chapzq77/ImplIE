President Chen Shui-bian will visit the Marshall Islands next
month to attend the Taiwan-South Pacific leaders' summit
scheduled to take place Oct. 12, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs
(MOFA) said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
MOFA officials said President Chen will depart for the Marshall
Islands Oct. 11, one day after the Double Ten National Day
celebration activities. He will not visit any other diplomatic
allies during the visit, they added.
</P>
<P>
The ministry is still communicating with the leaders of Taiwan's
six diplomatic allies in the region, namely the Marshall Islands,
the Solomon Islands, Palau, Kiribati, Nauru and Tuvalu, to see if
they can attend the summit in person, the officials added.
</P>
<P>
They noted that President Chen said earlier that he hopes New
Zealand can send officials to the meeting as observers. The
ministry is also actively working to have Australia send
officials as observers, they added.
</P>
<P>
The MOFA is also communicating with the United States on the
feasibility of President Chen making a stopover in Guam en route
to the Marshall Islands, although the ministry is not ruling out
the possibility of arranging transit stops in other locations,
they said.
