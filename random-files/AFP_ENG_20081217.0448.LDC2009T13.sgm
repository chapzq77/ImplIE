New oil giant Angola lowers sights as takes OPEC helm
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Angola took the helm on Wednesday of the oil cartel OPEC at a
time when plunging crude prices are casting a shadow over the
previously glowing prospects of Africa's fastest growing economy.
</P>
<P>
The resurgence of the southern African nation, which was
devastated by a 27-year civil war, has been almost entirely
dependent on its oil output which accounts for a staggering 90
percent of revenue.
</P>
<P>
Angola is OPEC's newest member, only joining in 2007, and sees
its year-long presidency as a chance to forge a new image for a
country more usually associated with conflict.
</P>
<P>
"For us it's very important to associate with this prestigious
institution and for Angola to play a very important role on the
price of oil in the context of the financial crisis," said
Ambassador Nelson Cosme, director for Africa and the Middle East,
at Angola's foreign ministry.
</P>
<P>
Angola has overtaken Nigeria as sub-Saharan Africa's largest oil
producer, pumping around two million barrels per day, and is now
the biggest supplier to China.
</P>
<P>
Months of high oil prices, which hit a peak of 147 dollars a
barrel in July, led the ruling party to announce ambitious
spending plans ahead of parliamentary elections in September such
as building one million new homes.
</P>
<P>
But with price having now slumped to around 45 dollars a barrel,
the government has had to revise its 2008 growth forecast from 20
percent to 16 percent and begin to eat into its reserves.
</P>
<P>
Economy Minister Manuel Junior said last week that the government
may have to rethink its 42 billion dollar spending plans for 2009
if oil prices continue to stagnate.
</P>
<P>
"Should there be the need for a revision of the state budget due
to the drop of the oil price in the world market that will be
done next year," Junior said in parliament.
</P>
<P>
This spending plan is essential for the reconstruction of a
nation decimated by the civil war which ended in 2002, with 70
percent of the population still living on less than two dollars a
day, according to the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
There are also fears that lower oil prices will lead to a
slowdown in investment in Angola's oil industry which could have
a knock-on effect on training and jobs.
</P>
<P>
Salim Abdul, a Luanda-based analyst, said that Angola found
itself in the same boat as many countries that were so heavily
reliant on oil revenue.
</P>
<P>
"Many members of OPEC need oil to go up because they have
calculated their budgets based on high oil prices," he told AFP.
</P>
<P>
"For instance Angola has promised to build one million houses and
they have to find the revenues from somewhere to do that. And you
see the same things happening in Nigeria and Venezuela for
example."
</P>
<P>
Speaking before he left Angola for Wednesday's meeting in Oran,
Algeria, Angola's oil minister Jos√© Maria Botelho de Vasconcelos
said he expected OPEC to make cuts of around 1.5 to 2 million
barrels of oil per day.
</P>
<P>
A formal announcement was expected later after Saudi Arabian oil
minister Ali al-Nuaimi said the cartel had agreed to a record cut
of two million barrels a day, representing nearly 10 percent of
daily output.
</P>
<P>
Justino Pinto de Andrade, director of economics at Luanda's
Catholic University, said Angola still had every reason to count
its blessings as its oil wealth had transformed the country's
image from that of a perpetual vicim.
</P>
<P>
"Angola is a player -- and it's a player because of oil. Today if
you talk about Angola, you talk about oil," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Now with the presidency of OPEC, they are going to have more
visibility and I hope that this mandate goes well to guarantee a
positive image for the governance of Angola."
