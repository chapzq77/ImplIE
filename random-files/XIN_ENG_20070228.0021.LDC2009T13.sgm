BEIJING, Feb. 28 (Xinhua)

<P>
China has investigated more than 6,660 government officials
derelict of their duties for the past 19 months, said deputy
Procurator-General of the Supreme People's Procuratorate Wang
Zhenchuan Wednesday here.
</P>
<P>
Wang said at a work conference that Chinese procuratorates at all
levels have investigated more than 5,840 cases of duty
dereliction involving 6,664 government officials since August
2005, including 218 officials of county and division-level or
above.
</P>
<P>
But he did not disclose the number of government officials
convicted of duty dereliction after being investigated.
</P>
<P>
The duty dereliction investigation has been focused on government
officials and staff of justice department who have misused their
power for private gains, and on officials who have neglected
their duty causing major economic losses for the government.
</P>
<P>
"The investigation has helped maintain market order, secure
judicial justice and regulate use of government power," Wang
said.
</P>
<P>
He said that in 2007 the procuratorates will continue to focus on
investigation of cases in which judicial justice is hampered and
environment damaged due to official's dereliction of duty.
</P>
<P>
China investigated and charged a number of government officials
for dereliction of duty over the past few years.
