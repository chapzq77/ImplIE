<P>
Finland held Serbia to a scoreless draw Saturday, seriously
denting the home team's hopes of qualifying for the European
Championships.
</P>
<P>
Serbia attacked for most of the match but captain Dejan Stankovic
and forward Danko Lazovic missed two clear chances in the first
half.
</P>
<P>
Finland's goalkeeper Jussi Jasskelainen also made a diving save
to stop midfielder Bosko Jankovic's curling free kick in the 37th
minute.
</P>
<P>
Finland concentrated on defending and launching counter attacks.
In the 17th minute, forward Jonatan Johansson had a one-on-one
situation against Serbia goalkeeper Vladimir Stojkovic, but
failed to lob the fall into the net.
</P>
<P>
Serbia lost its dominance in the second half, creating only one
chance when Lazovic intercepted a poor backward pass in the 48th
minute, but Jaaskelainen managed to control his poor shot.
</P>
<P>
Finland has 18 points from 10 matches in Group A, while Serbia
has 15 from nine.
</P>
<P>
"Not everything is lost," said Serbia striker Nikola Zigic, who
came on as a substitute in the second half. "Now we play Portugal
and that is 'to be or not to be' match for us."
