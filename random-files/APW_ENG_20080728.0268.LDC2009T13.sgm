FRANKFURT, Germany 2008-07-28 08:17:29 UTC

Some 5,000 employees of Deutsche Lufthansa AG, Germany's largest
airline, walked off the job Monday to begin a strike for higher
wages, the ver.di union said.
</P>
<P>
Ground crews in Frankfurt, Hamburg, Munich and several other
cities were taking part in the stoppage, union spokesman Erhard
Ott said on ZDF television.
</P>
<P>
Still, Lufthansa said that initial effects of the walkout were
minimal.
</P>
<P>
"So far, all flights are on time," airline spokesman Klaus
Walther told ZDF.
</P>
<P>
Ott said, however, that the goal was not to affect customers with
"as many canceled flights as possible, but to hit the airline."
</P>
<P>
Ver.di, which represents some 52,000 Lufthansa workers, said
Friday that nearly 91 percent of its members voted for an open-
ended strike.
</P>
<P>
The union had sought a pay rise of 9.8 percent this year, and
rejected a Lufthansa offer of 6.7 percent spread through February
2010, plus a one-time bonus payment.
