AIDS victim ' s mother wants meeting with Republican Mike
Huckabee to discuss his AIDS comments

DES MOINES, Iowa 2007-12-11 11:58:52 UTC

The mother of Ryan White, an Indiana teenager whose life-ending
battle with AIDS in the 1980s engrossed Americans, wants to meet
with Republican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee to discuss
his comments 15 years ago that AIDS patients should have been
isolated.
</P>
<P>
The former Arkansas governor and Republican front-runner in the
important Iowa caucuses said Sunday that he stood by the
comments.
</P>
<P>
That has infuriated Jeanne White-Ginder, who said: "It's so
alarming to me."
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview Monday with The Associated Press from
her home in Leesburg, Florida, she said: "It's very important to
me that we don't live in the darkness" when people thought AIDS
was transmitted through casual contact, such as by "kissing,
tears, sweat and saliva."
</P>
<P>
"We have to treat this disease like a disease, and like Ryan
always said, not like a dirty word," she said.
</P>
<P>
White was 13 when he was diagnosed with AIDS in December 1984,
having contracted the disease from the blood-clotting agent used
to treat his hemophilia. He was barred from school the following
year out of fear the disease was spread casually. He died in 1990
at age 18.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the Human Rights Campaign, a gay rights group, and
the AIDS Institute were sending a letter to Huckabee asking him
to meet with White-Ginder -- who declined in the interview to say
what political party she belongs to -- and calling his comments
"completely beyond comprehension."
</P>
<P>
As a Senate candidate in 1992, Huckabee told the AP in a
questionnaire that "we need to take steps that would isolate the
carriers of this plague" if the federal government was going to
deal with the spread of the disease effectively. "It is the first
time in the history of civilization in which the carriers of a
genuine plague have not been isolated from the general
population, and in which this deadly disease for which there is
no cure is being treated as a civil rights issue instead of the
true health crisis it represents," he said then.
</P>
<P>
In an interview on "Fox News Sunday," Huckabee denied that those
words were a call to quarantine the AIDS population, although he
did not explain how else isolation would be achieved. "I didn't
say we should quarantine," he said. The idea was not to "lock
people up."
</P>
<P>
Huckabee acknowledged the prevailing scientific view then, and
since, that the virus that causes AIDS is not spread through
casual contact, but said that was not certain.
</P>
<P>
"I still believe this today," Huckabee said Sunday, that "we were
acting more out of political correctness" in responding to the
AIDS crisis. "I don't run from it, I don't recant it," he said of
his position in 1992. Yet he said he would state his view
differently in retrospect.
</P>
<P>
Huckabee outlined his views in 1992 for the AP more than a year
after President George H.W. Bush, a fellow Republican, urged an
audience of business executives not to fire or otherwise
discriminate against employees infected with HIV, the virus that
causes AIDS.
