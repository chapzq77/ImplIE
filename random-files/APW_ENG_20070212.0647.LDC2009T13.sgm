<P>
Croatia's former prime minister and leader of the main opposition
party, Ivica Racan, was having surgery Monday to remove a
cancerous kidney, his spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
The surgery is being performed at a clinic in Munich, Germany,
said Gordana Grbic.
</P>
<P>
Racan, who heads the Social Democrats, the strongest opposition
party, announced two weeks ago that doctors had found a cancerous
tumor in his right shoulder. Further checkups showed the primary
cancer was on his left kidney and had spread to his shoulder.
</P>
<P>
Racan, 62, temporarily withdrew from politics, saying he would
think of a possible return after the surgery.
</P>
<P>
His illness and absence could harm the party's prospects in
parliamentary elections set for November. The Social Democrats
are trailing the ruling Croatian Democratic Party in polls.
</P>
<P>
Racan was premier from 2000 to 2003, leading Croatia's first pro-
Western governing coalition after the authoritarian and
nationalist rule of late President Franjo Tudjman.
</P>
<P>
Racan was born in 1944 in a Nazi labor camp in Ebersbach,
Germany. In the communist-run former Yugoslavia, he was a
Communist, but later transformed his party into a pro-Western,
center-left group.
