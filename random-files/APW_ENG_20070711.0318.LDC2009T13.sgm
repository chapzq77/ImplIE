Four North Koreans have entered the Danish Embassy in Vietnam in
an apparent bid for asylum, a South Korean activist said
Wednesday.

The refugees included one man and three women, the activist told
The Associated Press on condition of anonymity due to the
sensitivity of the information. The Danish Embassy in Hanoi
confirmed via telephone that a family of two adults and two
children had entered the building, but gave no further
information on how their case would be treated.
