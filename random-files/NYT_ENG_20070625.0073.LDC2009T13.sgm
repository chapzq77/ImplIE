JAILED AND TORTURED, JOURNALIST STILL SEEKS JUSTICE IN LIBERIA
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHELSEA, Mass. - On Oct. 17, 2004, when the Red Sox revived their
World Series hopes by beating the Yankees in the 12th inning of
the must-win fourth game of the playoffs, Liberian-born Hassan
Bility was in a hotel room in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
Almost two years earlier, Bility, a journalist imprisoned and
tortured by the regime of former Liberian president Charles
Taylor, had fled Africa for Boston and heeded a resettlement
official's advice to become a Red Sox fan. Now he was spending
his days testifying against rebel leaders being tried by a United
Nations court for war crimes and helping prosecutors gather
evidence against Taylor. At night he watched baseball with court
officers from New Jersey who were cheering the pinstripes.
</P>
<P>
"I told them we believe," Bility says. "We always believe."
</P>
<P>
What Bility believes in most is the power of an independent
press. In his native Monrovia, he was editor in chief of The
Analyst, a newspaper that regularly reported on the violence and
abuses of Taylor's presidency, both in Liberia and in the arms-
for-diamonds war in neighboring Sierra Leone. "He was one of the
most outspoken and courageous journalists in Liberia," says
Joshua Rubenstein, New England director of Amnesty International.
Today Bility, 38, lives in a third-floor walk-up in Chelsea with
his wife and two sons, and he expects to testify against Taylor,
who is on trial in The Hague on charges of crimes against
humanity in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
"My concentration," Bility says, "has been to bring to justice
people who have abused people in Sierra Leone and Liberia."
</P>
<P>
Bility is a soft-spoken man, dressed in crisp white pants and
plaid shirt, his graying hair shaved close. He suffers hearing
loss in his left ear after being beaten badly in 1997 during his
first arrest. His elbows bear scars from the aftermath of his
seventh and final arrest: For six months in 2002 his jailers
often tied his elbows behind his back until they touched each
other; the tightened rope dug a groove so deep into his skin
Bility could slide a finger inside. He's regained feeling in an
arm numbed by the torture, but his shoulder still bothers him.
</P>
<P>
He is a reluctant refugee, the subject of an international
campaign for his release by Amnesty, Human Rights Watch, and the
US government. He resisted Taylor's insistence that he accept
exile once freed but acquiesced after a prison guard passed him a
note from his mother imploring him to agree to flee. He was
whisked from a Liberian prison to Ghana in December 2002, then
resettled in Boston in early 2003. He now speaks and writes about
his troubled homeland.
</P>
<P>
Boston-educated Taylor, the first African head of state to be
charged with war crimes, refused to attend the opening of his
trial before the United Nations Special Court for Sierra Leone
earlier this month. The trial resumes Monday (eds: June 25) and
is expected to last at least a year. Taylor was president of
Liberia from his election in 1997 until his exile to Nigeria in
2003.
</P>
<P>
Taylor stands accused of 11 counts of war crimes and crimes
against humanity - including mass murder, sexual slavery, rape,
mutilation, and the use of child soldiers - for allegedly
fomenting civil war in Sierra Leone to gain control of its
abundant natural resources. Taylor arrived in Boston in 1972 and
lived here for a decade while studying economics at Chamberlayne
Junior College in Newton and Bentley College in Waltham. He
returned in 1984, after being charged with embezzling Liberian
government funds, only to be arrested here. He escaped from the
Plymouth House of Corrections in 1985 while awaiting extradition.
</P>
<P>
Staying strong
</P>
<P>
Bility traces his interest in journalism to the unrest that swept
his native country after President Samuel K. Doe was killed in
1990. "I had witnessed a lot of abuses, a lot of murders. I
thought the Liberian media wasn't reporting what was happening,
either from fear or censorship," he says. "I felt it was
necessary for somebody to stand up and report what was real."
</P>
<P>
During this period of chaos, West African peacekeepers managed to
ring off the capital city of Monrovia, says Binaifer Nowrojee,
former legal counsel for Human Rights Watch Africa. "Remarkably,
in that little safe haven, Liberia went from having no human
rights community to having a thriving human rights community.
Hassan came out of that moment in time," she says. "In the human
rights community he was very much a household name."
</P>
<P>
Bility was first arrested the year Taylor was elected president.
He was editor of The National newspaper at the time and writing
about the proxy war in Sierra Leone, for which Taylor is now on
trial. "That issue was taboo," Bility recalls. "I reported on it
extensively. My colleagues said, 'You are reckless. That guy
could kill you.' That was the battle line." He was released after
two days without having been charged.
</P>
<P>
Taylor's government took over The National in 1998, and Bility,
who had been arrested two other times by then, moved to The
Analyst. There he reported on gang rapes, mass arrests, and
executions. Twice the government closed the paper for at least a
month, and four more times Bility was arrested, the latest on
June 24, 2002. Government agents pretending to peddle a
corruption story dragged Bility away in front of his crying 4
-year-old son. They blindfolded him, beat him, and took him to
Taylor's home, Bility recalls.
</P>
<P>
"Charles Taylor introduced me. 'Gentlemen, this is the guy who
wants to overthrow me,"' Bility says. "He is sitting at his desk.
There are several chairs and sofas around, but everybody is
sitting on the floor. He said, 'Have a seat.' I sat on a chair. A
minister said, 'What are you doing? Do you compare yourself to
the president?"'
</P>
<P>
Bility denied Taylor's assertions that he was smuggling arms into
Liberia and arranging for the president's assassination. He spent
the next six months incommunicado in various prison cells,
including one underground hole only 3 feet high and half-filled
with water. He describes months of being starved and beaten and
stomped, of having electric shock applied to his genitals. A
guard offered him a cigarette, and he's been a smoker ever since.
</P>
<P>
Once, when he was sitting in a room with government agents who
had been drinking, one, a renowned marksman, poured Scotch down
Bility's throat, then balanced the Dewar's bottle on the
blindfolded prisoner's head. The marksman shot the bottle, and
glass rained down on Bility. "If I had a heart condition," Bility
says, "my blood would have exploded from my head."
</P>
<P>
Once Taylor visited him in prison. "A flock of sparrows flew
overhead," Bility says. "He looked up and said, 'My birds.' That
scared me."
</P>
<P>
Through all this, Bility never made a false confession. "People,"
he says simply, "believe what I say is true."
</P>
<P>
His first inkling that his plight had attracted international
attention occurred in the fall of 2002, when a guard slipped him
a letter from Amnesty urging him to stay strong. "Until then I
thought I would die," Bility says. "From that day on I had hope."
</P>
<P>
Coming to Boston
</P>
<P>
The torture stopped, and for two months Bility's captors worked
to make him presentable to the outside world. They sent a doctor.
They cut his thick, matted hair. He refused to go into exile.
"There was no way Taylor would kill me," he says. "Once the US
government was involved and Amnesty was involved, there was no
way."
</P>
<P>
Finally, Bility agreed to leave Liberia. American resettlement
officials suggested he would like Washington or Boston. He had
had enough of capital cities. And he had heard of the Celtics. In
January 2003, Bility moved to Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
He neglected advice to seek counseling to help him recover from
the torture he'd suffered. "I thought I really didn't need it. I
was completely traumatized. Each time I would see a police
officer my heart would pump up," he says. "What helped me was to
speak about it. The more I spoke about it, the less stressful it
became, and things became normal."
</P>
<P>
Like many other Liberians, Bility is hopeful that President Ellen
Johnson-Sirleaf will bring progress. Bility wants more, however.
He wants Taylor held accountable not only for the atrocities he
committed in Sierra Leone but also for those he committed in
Liberia.
</P>
<P>
"You cannot build a viable democracy," he says, "without justice
being the solid foundation."
