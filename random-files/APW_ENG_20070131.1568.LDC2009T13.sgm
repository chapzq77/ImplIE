Fed leaves interest rates unchanged for fifth straight meeting
</HEADLINE>

WASHINGTON 2007-01-31 19:31:01 UTC
</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve, faced with a strongly rebounding economy,
left interest rates unchanged on Wednesday while repeating
concerns about inflation.
</P>
<P>
The central bank voted to leave the federal funds rate, the
interest that banks charge each other, at 5.25 percent, where it
has been since last June.
</P>
<P>
That decision had been widely expected given an economy that is
exhibiting better-than-expected growth. While the Fed had been
expected to start cutting rates later this year, economists are
now worried that the central bank may feel the need to resume
raising rates for fear that inflation pressures will not keep
easing.
</P>
<P>
The rate action was supported by a unanimous 11-0 vote of the
Federal Open Market Committee, the panel of Fed board members in
Washington and regional bank presidents who meet eight times a
year to set interest rates.
</P>
<P>
At the previous four meetings, Jeffrey Lacker, the president of
the Richmond Fed regional bank, had dissented in favor of a
further boost in rates. However, he is not a voting member of the
FOMC this year.
</P>
<P>
The action means that banks' prime lending rate, the benchmark
for millions of consumer and business loans, will remain
unchanged at 8.25 percent.
</P>
<P>
While the Fed had been widely expected to leave rates unchanged
for a fifth straight meeting, there are growing concerns its next
move could be to raise rates, given a string of indicators
showing stronger-than-expected growth.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday before the Fed announcement, the government reported
that the U.S. economy grew at a solid annual rate of 3.5 percent
in the final three months of 2006 as strong consumer spending and
an improving trade picture offset severe slowdowns in housing and
auto production.
</P>
<P>
In a brief statement explaining its actions, the Fed said,
"Recent indicators have suggested somewhat firmer economic growth
and some tentative signs of stabilization have appeared in the
housing market."
</P>
<P>
The statement also said that "reading on core inflation have
improved modestly in recent months and inflation pressures seem
likely to moderate over time."
</P>
<P>
However, Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke and his colleagues followed up
that comment by repeating its belief that the panel "judges that
some inflation risks remain." It said that the extent of any
future rate hikes will depend on how the prospects for inflation
and economic growth evolve in coming months, repeating the
language it has been using at previous meetings.
</P>
<P>
Since the Fed's last meeting Dec. 12, the economic news has been
uniformly good, with job growth stronger than expected, energy
prices dropping and the overall economy navigating the rough
waters of a severe housing slump.
</P>
<P>
Many analysts have gone from forecasting that the Fed would cut
rates possibly three times this year to thinking that the most
likely outcome is that the Fed will leave rates steady for a
considerable period. And some are worried that there could be
rate hikes in the second half of the year if inflation does not
slow further.
</P>
<P>
The Fed last changed rates back in June when it pushed the
federal funds rate, the interest that banks charge each other, up
to 5.25 percent.
</P>
<P>
It marked the 17th consecutive meeting that the central bank had
nudged rates up by a quarter-point. Before the Fed started
raising rates in June 2004, the funds rate was at 1 percent and
the prime rate stood at 4 percent, both the lowest levels in more
than four decades.
</P>
<P>
The Fed is hoping to engineer a "soft landing" in which the
economy slows and inflation pressures are lowered but the
slackening of business activity does not spell recession.
