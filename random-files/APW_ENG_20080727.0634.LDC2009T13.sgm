About 300 people were evacuated from homes, campgrounds and a
recreational vehicle park Sunday and a helicopter was sent to
rescue others after flooding caused by the remnants of Hurricane
Dolly.
</P>
<P>
Meteorologists said more than 6 inches (15 centimeters) of rain
fell in the mountainous area, and flash flood watches were in
effect for central and eastern New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
The Rio Ruidoso went over its banks about midnight, said Tom
Schafer, Ruidoso's emergency management coordinator.
</P>
<P>
"Water's just going everywhere," Schafer said.
</P>

A police helicopter was sent to rescue people reported to be
standing on buildings and vehicles, state Department of Public
Safety spokesman Peter Olson said. A dive team was also sent to
rescue people from the flooded areas, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said he had no idea how many were stranded.

<P>
Earlier, four people were rescued after being trapped by rising
water, but no one was seriously injured, Schafer said.
</P>
<P>
State officials estimated more than 60 homes have been damaged.

People evacuated from the Bonito Creek Campground was sent to a
nearby church, he said.

<P>
Most of the 40 or so people who showed up at the Angus Hill
Church of the Nazarene were campers "who just came up for a nice
weekend" and were flooded out, said Sue Hutchinson, who operates
a first aid clinic at the church.

<P>
Several campers said they awakened when their tents began
floating down the river, Hutchinson said.
