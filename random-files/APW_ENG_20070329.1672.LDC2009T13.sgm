ALBUQUERQUE, New Mexico 2007-03-29 20:42:33 UTC

Jennifer Wilbanks, the bride-to-be who made headlines by skipping
town just days before her planned wedding in Georgia, has a new
starring role in New Mexico -- as the inspiration for a police
recruiting billboard.
</P>
<P>
The Albuquerque Police Department plans to unveil the ad on 10
digital billboards across the city next week, the Albuquerque
Journal newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"Running away from your current job? Call APD recruiting," the ad
reads, above a photo of Officer Trish Hoffman grabbing the veil
of a bride, adorned in gown and running shoes.
</P>
<P>
Hoffman got national attention two years ago after Wilbanks
landed in Albuquerque claiming she had been abducted before she
was set to marry. Photos of Hoffman leading Wilbanks through the
airport with a blanket over the runaway bride's head appeared on
televisions and in newspapers around the world.
</P>
<P>
Now, Hoffman will be on billboards.
</P>
<P>
"I am sure I am going to get some harassment," she told the
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The ad will be up for a month at a cost of $16,000 (euro12,000).
Depending on the response, the department may incorporate it into
fliers, posters and possibly TV ads.
</P>
<P>
"The runaway bride is one of those stories that people across the
nation still talk about," said Police Chief Ray Schultz. "We hope
we can capitalize off of that."
</P>
<P>
The department currently has fewer than 1,000 officers and is
trying to build the force to 1,100 by this summer.
</P>
<P>
Wilbanks got her nickname "runaway bride" after fleeing before
her wedding and making up a story about being kidnapped and
sexually assaulted. Actually, she got cold feet and fled to New
Mexico. She later recanted, saying she ran away because of
personal issues, and pleaded no contest in Georgia to telling
police a phony story.
</P>
<P>
She was sentenced to two years' probation and performed community
service that included mowing the lawns at public buildings.
</P>
<P>
Wilbanks and her then-fiance John Mason later ended their
engagement and filed lawsuits against each other, which were
dropped last year.
