INSURER SEEKS BIG CAPE HIKE  HOME INSURER SEEKS 25% HIKE ON CAPE
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The state's home insurer of last resort told state regulators
Friday that a 25 percent increase in its base rate on Cape Cod
would be a major step toward covering the company's costs, but
added that it is receptive to offering premium reductions to
consumers who install hurricane shutters and roof tie-downs or
accept higher deductibles.
</P>
<P>
The Massachusetts Fair Plan's rate request, which follows the
approval of a similar-size increase in October, faced near-united
opposition from the attorney general, several Cape lawmakers, and
a number of homeowners who came from the Cape to testify. They
called a 25 percent increase excessive and warned that it could
force many seniors from their homes and trigger an economic
meltdown on the Cape.

"When you add the high cost of home insurance to the high cost of
housing, you're going to cripple the market and eventually the
state," said Harvey Baumann, a retired surgeon from Wellfleet.
</P>
<P>
The price of home insurance is becoming a major issue on the Cape
and islands, in New Bedford, and most of Plymouth County.
Premiums have been rising quickly in those areas because a
handful of little-known companies that use computer models to
forecast the effects of tropical storms and hurricanes have
dramatically raised their damage estimates. These estimates have
had a ripple effect throughout the insurance industry.
</P>
<P>
Reinsurers, the companies that insure insurance companies against
catastrophic events, have raised their rates substantially.
Insurers, in turn, have increased premiums to offset higher
reinsurance costs and set aside money for future hurricanes. Some
companies have decided the risks are too great on the Cape and
either reduced their exposure there or walked away, leaving
homeowners with no choice for insurance but the Fair Plan.
</P>
<P>
State officials Friday said 30,000 homeowners on the Cape have
been dropped by their insurers since 2004. Nearly all of them
have migrated to the Fair Plan, which insures 41 percent of the
homes on the Cape and islands. The Fair Plan, which operates as
an independent company but is financially backed by all of the
state's home insurers, has also become the state's largest home
insurer, with 13.5 percent of the total market.
</P>
<P>
The Fair Plan's current base premium on the Cape is $1,155 and
would rise to $1,444 if the pending rate increase is approved.
The Fair Plan's average premium on the Cape is currently $1,500.
</P>
<P>
Jack Golembeski, chief executive of the Fair Plan, said he
averaged the damage forecasts of the two leading models in
developing his company's proposed rates. He said the Fair Plan is
seeking a 25 percent increase in its base rate on the Cape and
islands, New Bedford, and most of Plymouth County except for
Brockton. He said rates should be higher, but have been adjusted
downward to prevent rate shock. He said the numbers indicate a 75
percent increase in New Bedford is warranted.
</P>
<P>
Jane Logan, an insurance broker from Sandwich, said she doesn't
understand why rates are so much higher on the Cape than in
Boston, which is also on the water. She also charged that the
modeling companies operate under the influence of insurers and
are churning out estimates that benefit them.
</P>
<P>
Other members of the insurance industry question the accuracy of
the models, too. James M. Stone, chairman of Plymouth Rock Co. of
Boston, said in a recent letter to shareholders that he worries
the hurricane models are biased toward higher damage projections.
</P>
<P>
"I worry that all of these models, though well-intentioned, are
biased upward in the states where events are fewest and actual
data therefore most sparse," Stone wrote. "Rating agencies and
the modelers themselves have more to lose by underestimating the
risk in seldom-hit locations than overestimating it."
