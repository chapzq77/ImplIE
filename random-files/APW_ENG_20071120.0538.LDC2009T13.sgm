WARSAW, Poland 2007-11-20 11:26:33 UTC

A Polish court issued a European arrest warrant Tuesday for
Helena Wolinska, a Stalinist-era prosecutor now living in Britain
who is accused of fabricating evidence against suspects in the
notorious show trials of the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
Wolinska, 88, who has lived in England since 1972 and is a
British citizen, is accused of masterminding the wrongful arrest
and execution of Gen. Emil Fieldorf, a World War II-era Polish
hero, and of the wrongful arrest of 24 others. If convicted, she
could be sentenced to up to 10 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
Fieldorf, known by the alias Nil, led the Polish underground Home
Army, which rose up against the Nazi occupiers during World War
II. After the war, he refused to collaborate with the secret
service of the new communist regime.
</P>
<P>
A regional military court in Warsaw said that it had issued a
European Arrest Warrant for Wolinska -- an EU warrant meant to
speed up extraditions within the bloc.
</P>
<P>
However, it wasn't immediately clear if Britain would follow
through. Britain's Home Office refused a previous extradition
request for Wolinska from Poland in 2006, arguing that the
alleged wrongdoing had taken place too long ago.
