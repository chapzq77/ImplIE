News Analysis: APEC pledges "new commitment" to Asia-Pacific
development

LIMA, Nov. 23 (Xinhua)
</P>
<P>
The 16th Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit
concluded Sunday in the Peruvian capital with the leaders
pledging "a new commitment" to jointly tackling the global
financial crisis, regional economic integration and corporate
social responsibility.
</P>
<P>
FINANCIAL CRISIS
</P>
<P>
The leaders issued a special statement on the financial crisis
Saturday, vowing to take action "individually and collectively"
to restore confidence in their economies and keep the region
moving along the path of long-term growth.
</P>
<P>
"We have already taken urgent and extraordinary steps to
stabilize our financial sectors and strengthen economic growth
and promote investment and consumption," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"We will continue to take such steps and work closely, in a
coordinated and comprehensive manner, to implement future actions
to address this crisis," it added.
</P>
<P>
The leaders specifically pledged support for efforts by export
credit agencies, international financial institutions and private
banks to ensure that adequate finance is available to businesses,
including small and medium-sized enterprises, and to keep trade
and investment flowing in the region.
</P>
<P>
They also welcomed continued development and innovation in the
financial sector, while calling for more effective regulatory and
supervisory tools as financial systems become more complex.
</P>
<P>
The APEC leaders also expressed support for the Washington
Declaration adopted at the Group of 20 summit earlier this month
and the common principles that will guide the Action Plan for
financial markets reform.
</P>
<P>
As one of the world's biggest regional blocs with a wide
geographical span and huge diversity among its members, APEC has
sent a strong signal that world economies are ready to do
everything possible to stave off the crisis and restore market
confidence, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
FREE TRADE
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, the leaders highlighted the urgency to curb
any upturn of protectionism that could arise from the crisis and
exacerbate the current economic situation.
</P>
<P>
The leaders reiterated their "firm belief that free market
principles, and open trade and investment regimes will continue
to drive global growth, employment and poverty reduction."
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, they promised not to raise new barriers to
investment and trade in the next 12 months.
</P>
<P>
"We...will refrain within the next 12 months from raising new
barriers to investment or to trade in goods and services,
imposing new export restrictions, or implementing World Trade
Organization (WTO) inconsistent measures in all areas, including
those that stimulate exports," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
On the Doha round of trade talks, APEC leaders expressed their
hope for "an ambitious and balanced conclusion" to lay the
foundation for the economic growth and prosperity in the region.
</P>
<P>
"We are committed to reach agreement on modalities next month on
the basis of progress made to date," they added.
</P>
<P>
The strong call by the leaders for free trade and rejection of
protectionism indicates that world economies are determined to
prevent a repeat of the Great Depression of the 1930s when "a
wrong approach" was taken, as U.S. Trade Representative Susan
Schwab said.
</P>
<P>
CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY
</P>
<P>
One of the highlights of the APEC Leaders' Week from Nov. 16-23
was the leaders' efforts to explore the social dimension of APEC,
especially corporate social responsibility, amid the crisis.
</P>
<P>
"The crisis also highlights the need to develop more effective
standards of corporate governance and risk management as well as
the importance of social responsibility in the financial sector,"
the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The leaders urged companies to incorporate social responsibility
into their business strategies to take account of social, labor
and environmental concerns.
</P>
<P>
Such a move is likely to boost confidence among investors and
consumers who have accused some companies of a reckless pursuit
of profits, which triggered the financial meltdown, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
However, it remains to be seen how companies across the world can
promote the practice "on a voluntary basis" as stated in the Lima
Declaration issued Sunday.
</P>
<P>
More stringent measures need to be taken to prevent a repeat of
the economic turmoil, critics say.
</P>
<P>
As APEC leaders largely refrained from digging into details of
the pledged action before a new U.S. president takes office next
January, world economies should remain strongly vigilant about
the ongoing financial storm, which may get worse before it can
get any better, analysts say.
