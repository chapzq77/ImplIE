SUPPLIERS -- The nation's auto suppliers are taking drastic
measures in the face of a weakening auto market and shift in
consumer demand, cutting spending, laying off thousands of
workers and closing plants around the country. September was an
especially grim month for suppliers, with companies announcing
plans to shutter at least 12 plants and eliminate thousands more
jobs. A recent report by consultant Grant Thornton LLP said one-
third of auto suppliers are in danger of collapse. Many of those
that are struggling are companies with sales tied to Detroit's
Big Three automakers and particularly those entrenched in the
light truck and SUV market. By David Shepardson

TURNOUT-MICH -- National elections officials are predicting a
surge in first-time voters, and an overall large turnout. Some
Michigan elections officials are taking the warning to heart and
are beefing up preparations for Nov. 4. Detroit is hiring
security guards for polling sites. Others are staffing up
significantly from what they usually do. Farmington Hills clerk,
for example, is tripling the number of voting stations and
doubling poll workers that day. And she's trying to deputize some
residents and send them to college campuses to allow Farmington
Hills residents, who are on campus at Michigan colleges, to meet
the requirement that they vote in person for the first time. We
talk to other clerks about what they expect and how they plan to
accommodate what might be a record turnout. Because of the
contested Democratic primary in January, Michigan was spared the
crush of primary voters that swamped some states. But it was a
learning experience for the others that we missed. Although
Monday is the deadline for registrations, state officials report
100k more registered voters this year as of July than at the last
election. Michigan has always been a high-percentage registration
state, however. And getting people to vote is very different from
getting them registered. By Charlie Cain and Mark Hornbeck

KEVORKIAN -- Jack Kevorkian, the euthanasia enthusiast, is a man
of peckish appetite and little need. He lives alone, disavows God
and subsits on less than 500 calories a day. Reducing his
footprint further still, Dr. Death has gone green, having
recently purchased an electric car. His reason for the green car
is not so much to save the human race, he says, since he has
little regard for the human race. But rather, Kevorkian, says he
doesn't really need a gas guzzler since he doesn't stray far from
his rundown apartment complex anyhow. "I don't enjoy flashy cars.
I live in a dump. I don't each much," he says. "Discipline.
Americans don't have discipline." The electric car is a far cry
from the vehicles he used to own before being sent to prison for
8-and-a-half years after lethally injecting Thomas Youk, who
suffered from Lou Gehrig's disease. Dr. Kevorkian taped the
death, admitting on 60 Minutes that he wanted the tape to lead to
his arrest. He got his wish. Still, the cantankerous Kevorkian,
who was paroled a year ago and has been living in relative
obscurity since, has found something new to be cantankerous
about. His driver's license expired while in prison, and to renew
it, he will have to take a driving test in a gasoline powered
car. By Charlie LeDuff

MUSIC-JAYZ -- Hip-hop megastar Jay-Z performed a free concert
Saturday night at Detroit's Cobo Arena. The event was sponsored
by Democratic presidential hopeful Barack Obama's campaign and
aimed toward registering voters. We cover the concert and talk to
attendees about whether it was the music or the message that got
them through the door. By Adama Graham
