DHAKA, Dec. 25 (Xinhua)
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh is eyeing to install its first nuclear power plant by
2015 to meet the country's mounting electricity demand, as the
International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA) has responded
positively to its installation plan.
</P>
<P>
"The IAEA's response received recently was found to be very
positive towards installation of a nuclear power plant," Energy
and Power Adviser Tapan Chowdhury was quoted by local newspaper
The Finance Express as saying on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh is planning to set up the country's first nuclear
power plant having a generation capacity between 700 MW and 1,000
MW at Rooppur in the northwestern Pabna district, 125 km
northwest of capital Dhaka.
</P>
<P>
Tapan Chowdhury said the IAEA, the global nuclear watchdog, also
asked Bangladesh to send a delegation to expedite the process of
installing a nuclear power plant with its assistance.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh submitted the work plan to the IAEA last October,
giving details on how the country planned to install the nuclear
power plant at Rooppur and maintain safeguards with proper
management of wastes.
</P>
<P>
The IAEA was pleased with the government commitment for setting
up the nuclear power plant, selection of the project site and
assurance of utilizing the plant for peaceful purposes, a senior
Power Division official said.
</P>
<P>
A five-member delegation comprising nuclear experts from the
Bangladesh Atomic Energy Commission (BAEC) is expected to visit
Vienna by mid-January 2008 to discuss the subject.
</P>
<P>
The total investment required in setting up a nuclear plant is
anywhere between 1.0 billion and 1.5 billion U.S. dollars,
sources from the BAEC said.
