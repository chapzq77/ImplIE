Sept. 11 families request permit to keep annual commemoration
ceremony at ground zero

NEW YORK 2007-08-01 22:24:38 UTC
</P>
<P>
A group of family members of victims of the Sept. 11 terrorist
attacks, outraged by city plans to move the commemoration
ceremony, filed a request Wednesday asking to hold the annual
event at the site of the destroyed World Trade Center.
</P>
<P>
The coalition filed the request with the Port Authority of New
York and New Jersey, which owns the site. The agency says
construction at the site would make a ceremony there unsafe, but
family members plan to sue if they are denied.
</P>
<P>
"This is the place we have. A precedent has been set in letting
us touch ground zero," said Diane Horning, a representative of
one of the family groups.
</P>
<P>
Rosaleen Tallon, of Advocates for a 9/11 Fallen Heroes Memorial,
said remains of people killed in the 2001 terror attack are still
being found at the site.
</P>
<P>
"How can we possibly not go there to memorialize these people?"
she said. "It is still their resting place, and I want to be
there."
</P>
<P>
The city has said that ground zero, now undergoing
reconstruction, is not safe for the large annual gathering, and
it plans to move the recitation of names to a nearby plaza.
</P>
<P>
Relatives of the victims of the 2001 terrorist attacks will have
some access to the site -- just not to the pit and not for a
ceremony, Mayor Michael Bloomberg said.
</P>
<P>
"It's just not safe," Bloomberg said. "Listen, we've had enough
tragedy on that site. Our first priority, No. 1, is to make sure
that everybody's safe, and nothing's going to get us off that."
</P>
<P>
Attorney Norman Siegel, who is representing the families, said
that if the Port Authority rejects the permit, the families would
consider a federal lawsuit on First Amendment grounds. He said
the groups had gotten consultations on safety and security and
that the site would be safe as long as the construction was
halted the day of the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Port Authority spokesman Stephen Sigmund said construction would
be stopped that day but the site still was not suitable for the
ceremony.
</P>
<P>
"As an agency that lost 84 friends and colleagues on September
11, the Port Authority is sensitive to the needs of those who
lost loved ones," he said. "We are actively looking at ways to
accommodate family members who want to pay their respects on the
World Trade Center site on 9/11, but the substantial construction
activity and current site conditions will not allow the formal
ceremony to be safely conducted on the site."
</P>
<P>
Every year, the names of the dead have been read aloud from a
platform along the western edge of the lower Manhattan site. The
roll call stops only for moments of silence at the times the two
planes hit and the twin towers collapsed.
</P>
<P>
During the reading, and throughout the rest of the day, families
have had access to the seven-story pit that was once the basement
of the twin towers, where they would lay flowers.
</P>
<P>
Bloomberg said family members will be able to leave flowers in an
area along the southern edge of the site, but they will not be
allowed into the pit.
</P>
<P>
"There isn't a place to do that anymore, unfortunately, and next
year there will be even less," he said. "The next time you'll be
able to have a ceremony on the site is really when we complete
the memorial."
</P>
<P>
Construction on the memorial began last year, and it is expected
to open in 2009.
