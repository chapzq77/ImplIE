CHARLESTON, South Carolina 2008-04-19 23:56:01 UTC

Serena Williams reached her third consecutive final and won her
14th straight match when she beat Alize Cornet of France 7-5, 6-3
at the Family Circle Cup on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
In Sunday's final, she faces Vera Zvonareva, who beat Russian
compatriot Elena Dementieva for the first time 6-3, 6-7 (2), 6-3.
</P>
<P>
Williams was 4-1 lifetime against Zvonareva.
</P>
<P>
This will be Zvonareva's third final of the year, and fourth
since her last title at 2006 Cincinnati. She has played two
three-set matches in as many days, but said she has the energy to
beat Williams.
</P>
<P>
"I'll just have to stay focused the whole match," Zvonareva said.
"I'll have to not have ups and downs in the match and play as
even as possible."
</P>
<P>
Fifth-seeded Williams rallied from 4-1 down against the unseeded
Cornet in their semifinal.
</P>
<P>
Williams broke Cornet twice at love before taking the set. In a
second set featuring long baseline rallies, Williams broke Cornet
in the eighth game, then held serve at love to take the match.
</P>
<P>
"In just the whole match I thought she played really well, and I
just wasn't playing my game," Williams said. "I got caught a
little bit on the defensive a lot and I wasn't doing anything I
should have been doing."
</P>
<P>
Cornet, an 18-year-old ranked No. 40 in the world, also made the
semifinals at Amelia Island last week. She was runner-up earlier
this year at Acapulco, her best showing on the tour since joining
it last year.
</P>
<P>
Saturday was the first time she faced Williams.
</P>
<P>
"It was a little bit of a surprise for her because she didn't
know me," Cornet said. "I was like making the pressure on her and
it was working and after 4-1, you know, she played better."
</P>
<P>
Cornet said she has learned a lesson by reaching two consecutive
semifinals. "I have to fight and I have to play my game, and I
think I have the level now for beating the best, so it's a lot of
confidence for me," she said.
</P>
<P>
Williams said she will surely be facing Cornet again.
</P>
<P>
"She gets a lot of balls back, and those kind of players are
usually around for a good 20 years," Williams said.
</P>
<P>
Williams, who ousted No. 2 Maria Sharapova in Friday's
quarterfinals, won her last two tournaments in Bangalore and Key
Biscayne, and was 18-1 on the year. Her only loss was in the
Australian Open quarterfinals.
</P>
<P>
Reaching her latest final ensured the eight-time Grand Slam
winner passed $19 million (euro12 million) in career earnings for
No. 6 on the women's all-time list.
</P>
<P>
She played in the Charleston final previously in 2003, losing to
Justine Henin.
</P>
<P>
A day after No. 9-seeded Zvonareva knocked out top seed and
defending champion Jelena Jankovic, she broke No. 4 Dementieva
for 3-1 in the first set and held on, then rallied from 3-0 down
in the second to force a tiebreaker. In the third, Zvonareva
again rallied in a match in which she took her chances far
better. Zvonareva converted seven of 10 break points, Dementieva
only five of 22.
</P>
<P>
"I was just trying to find a way to win the match. I kept
fighting and I think it worked for me today," Zvonareva said.
