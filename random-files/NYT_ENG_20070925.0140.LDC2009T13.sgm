WRONGED MAN ON A MISSION GIVES SPARK TO ' LIFE '
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
British actor Damian Lewis is a natural lead as an oddball
American in NBC's "Life," which premieres Wednesday night. He
plays Charlie Crews, a cop who spent 12 years in jail for murder
before he was exonerated by DNA evidence. Now back on the force,
extremely wealthy from a settlement, Charlie is altogether loopy.
</P>
<P>
Lewis turns Crews into an amusing figure - almost as comic as
Tony Shalhoub's Monk, as he pronounces Zen platitudes to no one
in particular and constantly munches on fruit. In between bites
of an apple, he blithely admits to anyone who'll listen that he
hates cops. And he is helpless when it comes to all the
technological advances that occurred while he was in jail.
</P>
<P>
But throughout all the silly quips and nonsensical exclamations,
Lewis makes it subtly clear that Charlie's daffiness sits on top
of a gusher of emotion. The guy spent more than a decade in
prison among inmates who don't exactly take kindly to cops; we
can tell that his lightheartedness is but a thin veneer. And when
he's interrogating suspects, his fury clearly rears its head. Is
Charlie about to go off the deep end? Lewis, with his red hair,
pale face, and nonchalant expression, is compelling as he toys
with Charlie's balance.
</P>
<P>
The actor, who uses a flawless American accent, makes "Life"
worth a gander. And he is surrounded by a distinctive cast. Sarah
Shahi, from "The L Word" and the "Sopranos" episode in which Tony
ate magic mushrooms, is likable as Charlie's untrusting new
partner. Robin Weigart, who was Calamity Jane on "Deadwood,"
exudes a strong but ambiguous presence as the lieutenant. And
Adam Arkin is sweet as Charlie's former cellmate who now lives
above the garage at Charlie's mansion.
</P>
<P>
And, on top of it all, the "Life" back story, which appears to
involve the people who set up Charlie for the murder charge in
1994, is promising. While each episode will focus on a particular
criminal case and its resolution, like most TV procedurals, the
larger mystery about Charlie will unfold gradually. After one
episode, I was already curious about what landed Charlie in jail.
The premiere is presented partly as a documentary about Charlie,
on the occasion of his release from jail, and clearly some of
those featured in the reel were responsible for his
incarceration.
</P>
<P>
So why do I fear that, despite all its pluses, this show is not
long for the world? For one thing, as good as Lewis is, Charlie
may be too strange for mainstream consumption. He's a hard
character to understand, although I am certain that, ultimately,
he is understandable.
</P>
<P>
And then with the TV lineups so dense with cop shows, "Life" may
not have a flashy enough gimmick to attract viewers in the first
place. Somehow, a show known as "the Damian Lewis vehicle" or
"the kooky cop's show" does not exactly call out for an audience.
Up against "CSI: NY" and "Dirty Sexy Money," the lifespan of
"Life" will likely be short.
