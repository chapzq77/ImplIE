US aircraft carrier Stennis to arrive in Gulf

<P>
A new US aircraft carrier will arrive in the Middle East in about
a month, increasing the number of US Navy carriers in the region
to two, a Navy spokesman said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The USS John C. Stennis, with four accompanying ships, will soon
join the US Navy forces based in Bahrain, which includes aircraft
carrier Dwight D. Eisenhower, said Commander Kevin Aandahl of the
Fifth Fleet.
</P>
<P>
"It could be weeks, it could be more or... less," he said,
refusing to give a more precise date of arrival.
</P>
<P>
It is scheduled to sail Tuesday from its home port of Bremerton,
Washington, he said.
</P>
<P>
Stennis will have around 5,000 sailors, as well as around 80
fixed wing aircraft, including F/A-18 Hornet and Superhornet
fighter-bombers, he added.

US President George W. Bush earlier this month ordered a second
US aircraft carrier battle group to the Gulf and announced the
deployment of a Patriot missile defense battalion to the region
to protect allies against potential missile strikes.
</P>
<P>
Bush vowed at the time that US forces would "seek out and
destroy" any networks funneling weapons or fighters from Syria or
Iran into Iraq.
</P>
<P>
A senior US military official added that the United States
planned to keep two aircraft carrier battle groups in the Gulf
for months -- the first such deployment since the first year of
the Iraq war.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether the buildup was aimed at Iran and signaled a more
confrontational stance with its Islamic regime, Defense Secretary
Robert Gates said Monday the United States was simply reaffirming
the strategic importance of the Gulf region.
</P>
<P>
The US Central Command said last week that the US aircraft
carrier Eisenhower was dispatched to operate off the coast of
Somalia as US gunships pounded Al- Qaeda hideouts in the war-torn
country.
