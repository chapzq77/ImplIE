Taiwan may ease China-bound investment restrictions: reports
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Taiwanese government might ease China-bound investment
restrictions by the March 22 presidential poll, to woo support
for the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), reports said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Authorities are studying different ways of defining the net worth
of local enterprises, many of which have reached or come close to
the China investment ceilings, the Economic Daily News and United
Daily News said.
</P>
<P>
Currently, China-bound investment is capped at 40 percent of a
local company's net worth.
</P>
<P>
A more relaxed policy towards China, the island's largest export
market and favorite investment site, has been a focus of the two
presidential candidates.
</P>
<P>
Ma Ying-jeou, candidate of the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT),
is in favor of friendly ties with the mainland and has called for
a further liberalisation and raising of the investment ceilings.
</P>
<P>
The KMT scored a landslide victory in the January 12
parliamentary vote and the win prompted the pro-independence DPP
to amend its China policy, observers said.
</P>
<P>
DPP candidate Frank Hsieh also says the government should review
restrictions and permit investments to China on a case-by-case
basis instead of applying the 40 percent limit across the board.
</P>
<P>
Local business have channeled about 150 billion US dollars into
China since Taiwan lifted an investment ban in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
China took some 41 percent of the island's total exports in the
first 11 months of last year.
</P>
<P>
The two sides split in 1949 after a civil war, and while the
island has since governed itself, Beijing considers it part of
its own territory awaiting reunification.
