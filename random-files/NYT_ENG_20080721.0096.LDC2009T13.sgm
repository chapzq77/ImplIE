FOR MANY, EMERGENCY VISIT ENDS IN DISCONNECT
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The vast majority of patients don't fully understand the
instructions they receive from doctors when they leave the
emergency department, according to a new report.
</P>
<P>
Further, the vast majority of those patients weren't aware that
they didn't understand.
</P>
<P>
The study, published online this month in the Annals of Emergency
Medicine, followed 140 patients or their primary caregivers at
two hospitals in southeastern Michigan. Researchers asked
patients to recall what their doctors told them about their
diagnosis and cause, emergency department care, post-emergency
department care, and return instructions. Researchers then
compared their responses with their actual charts, and asked
whether the patients thought they had fully understood the
instructions.
</P>
<P>
The biggest source of confusion: what they were supposed to do
when they left the hospital.
</P>
<P>
That is "at minimal, distressing," said Dr. Kirsten G. Engel, the
study's lead author and a clinical instructor of emergency
medicine at Northwestern University's Feinberg School of
Medicine. "If there's one aspect of a patient's care and
instructions that I would hope they'd leave the emergency
department with, it's ... what they should be doing when they get
home.
</P>
<P>
"This means that those people are likely to have difficulty
following the directions," Engel said.
</P>
<P>
It's a problem Dr. Richard Wolfe, chief of emergency medicine at
Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, is familiar with - but he
said the article gave doctors their first hard data.
</P>
<P>
"This confirms what we've been suspecting for a while," he said.
In response to those concerns, the hospital is now rewriting
discharge instructions and uses nurses - instead of doctors - to
slowly and carefully walk patients through what they should do
when they get home.
</P>
<P>
Another important aspect of the paper was the degree to which
patients either weren't aware - or weren't willing to admit -
that they didn't understand instructions from doctors, Engel
said.
</P>
<P>
"If they have a deficit, the vast majority - four out of five -
of these people are not going to tell us they have a problem,"
she said. "They won't even say ((their comprehension is)) only
very good - they'll say it's excellent."
</P>
<P>
While the study's design is sound, its small size and limited
area - two hospitals within 15 minutes of each other - makes it
hard to generalize to patients throughout the country, said Dr.
Richard Bachur, chief of emergency services at Children's
Hospital Boston.
</P>
<P>
"The design was very nice, and the journal that it's in is, to
me, the premiere journal in emergency medicine," he said. But
because of its size, "it's almost like a pilot study."
</P>
<P>
The fact that patients were given handwritten discharge notes,
instead of the printed, bullet-point style fact sheets that have
become standard, he said, was also problematic.
</P>
<P>
Still, the study exposes a vulnerability in a field that is
constantly stretched because of pressure to see patients rapidly,
he said.
</P>
<P>
"Whatever strategy people develop for a discharge procedure
should be sure it includes real-time communication and an
opportunity to ask questions," Bachur said, particularly in
emergency departments. "That could make some of the concerns in
this article obsolete."
</P>
<P>
Tips for emergency department patients
</P>
<P>
Always ask for printed discharge information - and be certain you
understand what it says. "Making sure you really get what you're
supposed to do when you go home is important," said Dr. Kirsten
G. Engel, a clinical instructor of emergency medicine at
Northwestern University's Feinberg School of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
Bring a friend or family member. "Patients are sick, they're
anxious, tired, frustrated," Engel said. "It's hard to absorb
information when you're like that."
</P>
<P>
Understand that healthcare providers are there to help you, and
that you can trust them. "The issue of trust between patient and
physician ... has eroded over time," said Dr. Richard Wolfe,
chief of emergency medicine at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical
Center. "And that's really where the whole secret to successful
medical care lies."
</P>
<P>
Ask questions. "If you don't know or are uncomfortable, ask or
tell," Wolfe said. "There's no symptom or issue that's too small
to communicate - it's more the unanswered questions that can
create problems."
</P>
<P>
Get your provider's name and phone number in case you have any
follow-up questions.
</P>
<P>
Pick up any documentation related to your care and read it
thoroughly.
