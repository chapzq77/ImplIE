SKorea court upholds spy charges for activist
</HEADLINE>

<P>
A South Korean activist convicted of spying for North Korea lost
his appeal Thursday but had his prison term reduced.
</P>
<P>
Park Jong-Ki, a member of South Korea's minor leftist Democratic
Labor Party, was sentenced to a three-year jail term by a lower
court last November.
</P>
<P>
Park was found quilty of providing secrets to North Korea such as
information on US troop movements during his unauthorised visit
to Pyongyang in 2003. He was also convicted of posting pro-North
Korea material on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
The high court upheld the verdict but reduced the sentence to two
and a half years, saying Park had "sincerely repented of his
wrongdoing," a court official told AFP.
</P>
<P>
The court did not say whether Park was among five people,
including Democratic Labor party members, who were arrested last
October in the biggest case of alleged espionage since a
watershed inter-Korean summit in 2000.
