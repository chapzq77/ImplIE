Israel's Labor Party chooses new leader to challenge Sharon's Likud
Party in January

JERUSALEM (AP)
</P>
<P>
Israel's Labor Party members chose a relative newcomer to national
politics, former general Amram Mitzna, as their leader Tuesday to
challenge Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's Likud in January elections, an
exit poll showed.
</P>
<P>
The poll gave Mitzna, the dovish mayor of the coastal city of Haifa,
57 percent of the vote, compared to 35 for the current Labor Party
leader, Binyamin Ben-Eliezer. Legislator Haim Ramon was a distant
third with 8 percent, the poll of 1,000 Labor Party members showed.
</P>
<P>
While surveys had indicated Mitzna would win the primary, polls also
point to Sharon's hawkish Likud party winning the largest number of
seats in Jan. 28 general elections, benefitting from the Israeli
public's shift to the right after two years of Israeli-Palestinian
violence.
</P>
<P>
Mitzna said Tuesday that if elected prime minister, he would reverse
Sharon's course by withdrawing unilaterally from the Gaza Strip and
negotiating with any Palestinian leadership. ''The Labor Party is
embarking on a new path to present the Israeli public a real
alternative,'' he said at his headquarters after initial results were
announced.
</P>
<P>
Addressing supporters at Labor Party headquarters in Tel Aviv early
Wednesday, Ben-Eliezer conceded defeat but said he would keep his
supporters together, hinting that he would continue to challenge
Mitzna's supremacy from inside the party. He said Mitzna called him,
and Ben-Eliezer pledged the Mitzna his support in the election
campaign.
</P>
<P>
Ben-Eliezer's reputation among many Labor supporters was tarnished by
his stint as defense minister in Sharon's ``national unity''
government.
</P>
<P>
During his 20-month tenure, Ben-Eliezer oversaw military strikes
against Palestinian militants, and when he resigned last month,
soldiers were reoccupying many Palestinian towns.
</P>
<P>
``The voters are saying we want a different leadership and (Ben-
Eliezer) lost because he has been a party of the leadership for the
past 20 months,'' said political commentator Akiva Eldar.
</P>
<P>
Nabil Abu Rdeneh, an aide to Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, said
the election was an internal Israeli matter. ''We are concerned to
find leaders who are committed to work with us for peace,'' he said,
''therefore we welcome any Israeli leader who is going to be committed
to make peace with us and work according to the signed agreements.''
</P>
<P>
Ronnie Milo, a former Likud Cabinet minister, said the outcome would
only help Likud in January since the dovish Mitzna would alienate
centrist voters. ``I think the outcome is excellent for the Likud,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
Weizman Shiri, a Ben-Eliezer backer, confronted leading party dove
Yossi Beilin on television, accusing Beilin, a key Mitzna backer, of
destroying the party by moving it to the left.
</P>
<P>
About 120,000 registered Labor members were eligible to vote and
Israeli media said turnout was about 55 percent just before polls
closed. The actual vote was expected to be trickle into party
headquarters in Tel Aviv in the course of the evening.
</P>
<P>
Sharon called an early election at the beginning of the month after
Labor left the government in a fight over funding for Jewish
settlements. Sharon is currently battling Foreign Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu for Likud leadership, which will be decided in a primary
next week.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, 1999 and 2001 Israel held direct elections for prime minister
_  but that system has now reverted to the past parliamentary one in
which the prime minister is the party leader able to muster a majority
in the 120-member Knesset. Likud leads the hawkish bloc of parties,
and Labor the dovish one.
</P>
<P>
Mitzna, 57, was already looking ahead to January's election Tuesday
and his top priorities in office, saying he would reverse Sharon's
policy and unilaterally withdraw soldiers and settlers from the Gaza
Strip, the crowded coastal strip where about 5,000 Jewish settlers
live among more than 1 million Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
``There's no reason in the world for us to be in the Gaza Strip,'' he
said in an interview Tuesday morning as he toured party branches in
the Tel Aviv area. ``We will put our forces around Gaza, around the
fence, protecting Israel.''
</P>
<P>
Mitzna said a Gaza withdrawal wouldn't depend on negotiations with the
Palestinians, but that he also intended to resume talks without
conditions.
</P>
<P>
Peace talks collapsed nearly two years ago, and Sharon has refused to
resume negotiations without a cessation of violence and has sought to
marginalize Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
The bearded Mitzna said that if he became convinced that no agreement
with the Palestinians was possible, he would pull out unilaterally
from parts, but not all, of the West Bank. Jewish settlements in areas
evacuated by Israel would be uprooted.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian Planning Minister Nabil Shaath said the Palestinians were
looking for a Labor leader, and an Israeli government, that followed
in the footsteps of the late Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, who was
assassinated in 1995 by an ultranationalist Israeli Jew who opposed
Rabin's peace efforts and the negotiations with Arafat.
</P>
<P>
``We would like to see a government that offers the Israeli people an
alternative to war and to aggression,'' Shaath said.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli public has veered to the right following the collapse of
peace talks championed by Labor and more than two years of Israeli-
Palestinian fighting, and polls indicate Sharon's Likud would reap the
benefits in general elections.
</P>
<P>
Mitzna acknowledged he might lose in January, but said his election as
party leader would give Labor a stronger showing in parliament that
would allow it to be a ``fighting opposition'' if it didn't win
office.
</P>
<P>
Ben-Eliezer had said his appeal among more hawkish voters made him the
better challenger to Likud since Mitzna would ``take us further to the
left and keep us as the opposition for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
Ramon told voters to cast their ballot for the person who will
``present a real alternative of hope to Sharon's government of
failure.''
</P>
<P>
Mitzna said he wouldn't join a new unity government under the same
formula that Labor joined Likud in the past, but said he would
consider a coalition if Likud accepts his positions on disengaging
from the West Bank and Gaza and dismantling settlements.
</P>
<P>
``If we can make unity around separation from the Palestinians, OK.
But to go back to the Likud government of 2001-2002, no way in the
world,'' he said.
