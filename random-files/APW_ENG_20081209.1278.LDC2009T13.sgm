Werder Bremen beat Inter Milan 2-1 on Tuesday in its final
Champions League match and secured a place in the UEFA Cup.
</P>
<P>
Goals by Claudio Pizarro and Markus Rosenberg in the second half
gave Bremen its only win in Group B and allowed it to claim third
place, which took the team into the UEFA Cup when the European
competition resumes next year. Zlatan Ibrahimovic pulled one back
for Inter late in the game.
</P>
<P>
Bremen jumped over Anorthosis, which lost 1-0 at Panathinaikos.
Panathinaikos won the group with 10 points, while Inter, which
had qualified before Tuesday's match, finished second with 8.
Bremen ended with 7 and Anorthosis with 6.
</P>
<P>
Pizarro put Bremen ahead in the 63rd minute after a sloppy Inter
clearance and Rosenberg secured the win in the 81st with a low
shot that beat Inter's goalkeeper Julio Cesar although he had his
fingers on the ball.
</P>
<P>
Ibrahimovic, who came on at the start of the second half, scored
in the 88th, curling in a shot from 20 meters (yards) out that
bounced off the post into the net.
</P>
<P>
Inter coach Jose Mourinho rested striker Ibrahimovic in the first
half but with Adriano, Amantino Mancini and Ricardo Quaremsa up
front, his side seemed to have enough firepower to sink Bremen.
</P>
<P>
Still, Inter had only one clear chance, but Adriano's effort was
spoiled by goalkeeper Tim Wiese.
</P>
<P>
Bremen, weekend by several injuries and the suspension of
playmaker Diego, did not threaten much either, except for a
header from close range from Pizarro that was palmed away by
Cesar.
</P>
<P>
Ibrahimovic came on for Adriano at the break, but Bremen had the
first chance, with Pizarro sending a volley high over the net.
</P>
<P>
Although Inter appeared to be doing only the necessary, it nearly
took the lead early in the second half but Clemens Fritz cleared
Nicolas Burdisso's header off line.
</P>
<P>
With the game picking up pace, Cesar did well to parry Pizarro's
strong shot from the edge of the penalty area.
</P>
<P>
Pizarro finally found the target after 63 minutes. A bad
clearance by Inter gave Mesit Oezil some space, Cesar parried his
shot but could not hold onto the ball and Pizarro tapped in the
rebound.
</P>
<P>
Cesar was in trouble again after another shot by Oezil but this
time the Inter defense cleared the ball. Inter's Brazilian keeper
also fumbled a shot by Jurica Vranjes but recovered the ball.
</P>
<P>
Cesar could not hold Pizarro's next powerful shot either, but he
did well to turn the ball away from any Werder players. Aaron
Hunt threatened with a low shot but it narrowly missed the net.
</P>
<P>
Substitute Mario Balotelli was left unmarked at the far post of
Bremen's goal in the 79th, but he headed high from close range.
</P>
<P>
Two minutes later, Oezil broke down the left wings and sent in a
low ball behind the Inter defense and Rosenberg pounced to score
the goal that took Bremen into the UEFA Cup.
