WASHINGTON
</P>
<P>
Well, The Washington Post's Web site screwed up the John Edwards
story, too.
</P>
<P>
For 51 seconds.
</P>
<P>
And it was an accident, of the cringe-inducing variety.
</P>
<P>
The Democratic presidential candidate had already announced@ that
he was continuing his campaign, despite the recurrence of his
wife's cancer, when washingtonpost.com put up a headline at
12:32:20 p.m. Thursday: ``John Edwards Suspends White House
Bid.''
</P>
<P>
By 12:33:11 it was down -- replaced by ``Edwards: Wife's Cancer
is Back'' -- but not because anyone had caught the mistake.
</P>
<P>
``You don't like a bad story on the Web site for one second or 51
seconds,'' said Jim Brady, executive editor of
washingtonpost.com. ``It's embarrassing it got out there.''
</P>
<P>
Especially embarrassing because The Post reported Friday that
Politico.com and Reuters, each quoting an unnamed source, had
carried pieces that Edwards was going to suspend his campaign
before the former senator's news conference in North Carolina.
The news was already out at the time of The Post's online
screwup.
</P>
<P>
Brady said the Web site had prepared three different versions of
the headline and story summary -- on Edwards suspending his
campaign, dropping out or staying in -- so that it could move
quickly once the candidate announced his plans. Brady still isn't
sure how the mistake happened.
</P>
<P>
``It was not an error of journalism,'' he said. ``It was an error
of production ... Nobody knows how it got up because nobody hit
the publishing button,'' Brady said.
</P>
<P>
Leonard Downie Jr., the newspaper's executive editor, said he was
upset that the newsroom was not notified. ``This was a big
story,'' Downie said. ``The fact that we had a wrong report up
for 51 seconds -- even though it was unintentional -- should have
been known to us in the newsroom.''
</P>
<P>
Brady said he learned of the foulup early Thursday afternoon
after a tip had been carried on the Media Bistro blog Fishbowl
DC.
</P>
<P>
``The mistake I made was in not alerting people that it had
happened because it was a high-profile story,'' Brady said. ``We
should have been up front.''
</P>
<P>
Fishbowl DC posted a screen shot of the erroneous
washingtonpost.com headline Friday morning. Brady said his staff
is investigating possible defects in their publishing tools to
prevent a recurrence.
</P>
<P>
``At least we know we have a problem with the tool now,'' he
said, ``but that's not the way I'd prefer to find out about it.''
