ATLANTA -- During the recent NCAA Final Four weekend, I
participated in a sports information panel for parents whose
children want to play basketball at the college level. Here are
some of their questions that may help other parents of young
athletes.
</P>
<P>
Q: How do the nutritional needs of a 13-year-old middle school
athlete differ from those of a college athlete?
</P>
<P>
A: There are several differences, but the biggest difference is
that the 13-year-old is still growing and maturing (although I
have seen some college players sprout several inches between
their freshman and sophomore years). Girls need at least 1,700
calories a day and, depending on practice and competition
schedule, up to 2,800 calories. Boys need between 2,000 and 3,800
calories a day. Adolescent athletes also have greater needs for
iron, calcium and vitamin D. School-age athletes need help from
their parents in planning and packing snacks. It is not unusual
for an adolescent to have an 11 a.m. lunch period, with practice
at 4 p.m. That child will need a snack before practice to help
keep his or her energy level high. Peanut butter sandwiches,
yogurt, fruit, crackers and juice can be carried in a gym bag or
backpack for a pre-workout snack.

<P>
Q: My daughter doesn't like milk, so how can she get the calcium
she needs?
</P>
<P>
A: If she is not able to tolerate the milk sugar, or lactose, she
can try yogurt or hard cheeses as these have low levels of
lactose. If she just doesn't like milk, there are other good
sources of calcium including green vegetables (collards, turnip
greens, kale and broccoli), beans (navy, baked, great northern,
kidney and black), blackstrap molasses, soy nuts, figs and almond
butter. An orange has about 50 milligrams of calcium, and so does
a handful of almonds. She could also drink calcium-fortified
orange juice, rice milk or soymilk.
</P>
<P>
Q: My son plays basketball and is 6-foot-2 and still growing. He
is hungry all the time. What can I feed him?
</P>
<P>
A: This is a typical lament from a mom of a growing athlete - I
often think the household food bills must go down drastically
when a young athlete goes off to college! Three meals and three
snacks are a must. Many young athletes don't eat much during the
day and therefore are starving at night. Plan to feed your son
calorie- and nutrient-dense foods - that means a lot of calories
and nutrients in smaller volume. Examples are cream soups;
potato, chicken or tuna salads; nuts and trail mix; dried fruit;
peanut butter; and cheese. Milkshakes or smoothies are also
calorie-rich.
</P>
<P>
Q: I coach an after-school basketball team. The kids come
dragging into practice after school - is there a magic-bullet
food they can eat to keep their energy level high?
</P>
<P>
A: Everyone wants the magic bullet, but unfortunately, there
isn't one. However, I suggest that every child involved in after-
school sports carry an "energy pack" in his gym bag. This pack
could include a bottle of frozen sports drink (it will still be
nice and cold before practice), an energy bar (or granola or
cereal bar) and a fruit cup. That will give budding basketball
stars needed fluid, carbohydrates, B vitamins and sodium to help
power them though practice.
