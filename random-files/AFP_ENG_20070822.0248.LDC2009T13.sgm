RugbyU: More than two million tickets sold for rugby World Cup
</HEADLINE>

<P>
More than two million tickets have been sold for the rugby union
World Cup which kicks off on September 7, the organising
committee of rugby's showpiece four- yearly event said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"We have sold around 2.05 million tickets and it's not finished
since we're still shifting some 1,500 a day, and the tickets
returned to us are regularly put on sale," said committee head
Bernard Lapasset, adding that the goal of selling 85 percent of
the tickets had been fulfilled.
</P>
<P>
"We're encountering some difficulties in Edinburgh for the
Scotland v Romania match, and in Cardiff for Wales v Japan and
Fiji v Canada, for which 20,000 tickets have been sold with one
month to go before the game," Lapasset said.
</P>
<P>
"I regret not having signed an agreement in 1999 with the Welsh
so they could hand back some matches to us," said Lapasset, the
president of the French Rugby Federation.
</P>
<P>
"I think that the organisation of a World Cup in the future must
stay in one country so the same approach is applied everywhere."
