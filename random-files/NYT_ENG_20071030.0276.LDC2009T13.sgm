Kay Lipper Anderson, a woman with learning disabilities whose
marriage to Troy Anderson, who has similar disabilities, was the
subject of the Vows column of The New York Times on Sept. 16,
died on Friday near her home in Summit, N.J. She was 41.
</P>
<P>
The cause was cancer, diagnosed a week after Lipper and Anderson,
known as Andy, were married on Sept. 1 at Central Presbyterian
Church in Summit, said her father, A. Michael Lipper of Summit.
</P>
<P>
The column told how Lipper and Anderson connected at a party at
Our House, an organization in New Providence, N.J., for
developmentally disabled adults.
</P>
<P>
On their first date, Anderson, 46, came straight to the point,
asking if she wanted to get married. "I said, 'No, let's give it
a while,"' she recalled. "He said, 'OK, I'll wait a month,' and I
said, 'No, try a year."'

Kathleen Lipper Anderson was born in Westfield, N.J., on Nov. 17,
1965. She was a volunteer receptionist at the church. Her husband
works at two supermarkets.

In addition to her husband and her father, Anderson is survived
by her mother, Betty May O'Brien of Boulder, Colo.; her
stepmother, Ruth Lipper; and three brothers, Kenneth, of
Westfield; Steven, of New Providence; and Donald, of Davis,
Calif.
