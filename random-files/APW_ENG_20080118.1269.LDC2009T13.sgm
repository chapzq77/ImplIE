Report: Officers joked about dying immigrant in NY case
</HEADLINE>

NEW YORK 2008-01-18 19:14:34 UTC
</P>
<P>
Police officers were taped joking about a dying, homeless
Guatemalan immigrant after he was found on the side of a deserted
road in their suburban town, a television station reported.
</P>
<P>
"You wanna hear something really funny? ... He's alive," a
Bedford police officer tells a sergeant on a taped phone call
aired Thursday on WCBS-TV.
</P>
<P>
The two go on to marvel -- with the officer chuckling -- that
Rene Perez had apparently revived himself temporarily after
authorities thought him dead on April 28, 2007. The television
station said Perez died an hour after the officers' taped
exchange.
</P>
<P>
Perez had had a series of encounters with police in Bedford and
neighboring Mount Kisco that night. A Mount Kisco police officer
has pleaded not guilty to manslaughter charges in Perez's death.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors say the officer drove the drunken Perez to Mount
Kisco, dealt him a deadly blow to the abdomen and left him to
die.
</P>
<P>
In a later phone call to another Bedford sergeant, after Perez'
death, a Bedford officer sings the title line from the 1966 hit
record "Walk Away Renee" by The Left Banke.
</P>
<P>
Bedford Police Chief Chris Menzel defended the department,
telling WCBS, "We are not callous or indifferent." He said he
could not comment further on the ongoing case.
</P>
<P>
Fernando Mateo, president of Hispanics Across America, said in a
statement Friday that the incidents "show a clear indication that
we have troubled and hateful police officers and bosses who
clearly don't like Hispanic immigrants."
</P>
<P>
Mateo called for the suspension of the officers involved.
</P>
<P>
A lawyer for the Mount Kisco officer charged in the case, George
Bubaris, did not immediately return a telephone call late
Thursday. The lawyer, Edward Hayes, has subpoenaed all Bedford
police records about Perez. Prosecutors have called the subpoenas
improper and are trying to quash them; a hearing is set for next
week.
</P>
<P>
Perez, 42, an illegal immigrant, had a history of making drunken
calls to the police emergency dispatcher. He called Mount Kisco
police complaining of stomach pain on April 28, and police
records show Bubaris reported there was no need for further
action.
</P>
<P>
Lawsuits filed on behalf of Perez' family maintain that Mount
Kisco and Bedford made a practice of "dumping" each other's
undesirables in the neighboring town. Bedford police had taken
Perez into Mount Kisco hours before Bubaris allegedly took him to
Bedford.
</P>
<P>
Through a translator, Perez' brother, Anival Perez, called the
Bedford officers' taped conversations "unrespectful."
</P>
<P>
Bubaris, who said he is engaged to a woman of Puerto Rican
heritage, has said he is deeply troubled by implications that he
was racially insensitive
</P>
<P>
The friction created by large influxes of immigrants moving into
Westchester County, north of New York CIty, has led to recent
court cases alleging police bias against immigrant day laborers
and voting rights violations against Hispanics. Several municipal
officials have expressed frustration with the failure of the U.S.
Congress to come up with a national policy to deal with illegal
immigration.
