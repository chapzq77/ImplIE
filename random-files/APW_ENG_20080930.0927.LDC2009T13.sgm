McCain focusing on Iowa despite polls

DES MOINES, Iowa 2008-09-30 16:49:22 UTC

<P>
John McCain's second visit to Iowa in less than a month is
heartening Republicans who say it is proof their presidential
candidate intends to compete for the Midwestern state, despite
polls showing him behind Democrat Barack Obama.
</P>
<P>
Democrats counter that McCain's event Tuesday in Des Moines shows
he cannot be elected president without winning in states where he
trails his rival.
</P>
<P>
Republicans acknowledge that McCain is behind, but say the race
is closer than the polling indicates.
</P>
<P>
"I honestly believe right now in Iowa that Obama is ahead but it
is less than five," said former Iowa Republican Chairman Michael
Mahaffey.
</P>
<P>
A Des Moines Register poll conducted Sept. 8-10 showed Obama
ahead, 52 percent to 40 percent, while a Big Ten Battleground
Poll a few days later, conducted Sept. 14-17, found the rivals
tied at 45 percent.
</P>
<P>
The visit is McCain's second in less than two weeks. He held a
small-business round-table in Des Moines, following up on a Sept.
18 stop in Cedar Rapids with running mate Sarah Palin. His
campaign also has continued television advertising in the state
at roughly the same level as Obama.
</P>
<P>
"I don't believe Sen. Obama has the lead that one or two polls
indicate he does," said veteran Republican strategist Eric
Woolson.
</P>
<P>
That Republican optimism comes despite voter registration trends
that show Democrats have gained a more than a 100,000-person edge
in Iowa. Still, the last two presidential elections were decided
by razor-thin margins of 1 percentage point. Democrat Al Gore won
the state in 2000, and President George W. Bush won it during his
re-election in 2004 -- and independent voters still outnumber
those in each of the major parties.
</P>
<P>
Dennis Goldford, a political science professor at Drake
University, said McCain could still improve his standing in Iowa.
</P>
<P>
"They still have the time, they still have the money. It's too
early for them to bail out of Iowa," he said, noting the fairly
cheap cost of advertising here.
</P>
<P>
Veteran Republican strategist Bob Haus said all candidates should
be nervous about the Nov. 4 election.
</P>
<P>
"I have never seen an election that has had this many violent
mood swings," he said. "Six months ago we were talking about
Iraq, two months ago we were talking about flooding and now we're
talking about federalizing the financial system."
</P>
<P>
McCain used the roundtable discussion to issue his latest call
for dealing with the U.S. financial crisis, saying he spoke
earlier in the day with Bush and urged action. He asked Treasury
Department officials to use their stabilization funds to shore up
money market accounts, and to purchase mortgages.
</P>
<P>
"Housing and mortgages are at the root of this crisis," McCain
said. "I urge Treasury to take action to shore up mortgage
values."
</P>
<P>
McCain aides say Iowa has made the list of competitive states he
is focusing on. Iowa has seven electoral votes; it takes 270
decided in state-by-state contests to win the presidency.
</P>
<P>
"John McCain views Iowa as a key battleground," said spokeswoman
Wendy Riemann. "He intends to fight here until Nov. 4."
</P>
<P>
Obama aides read something else into McCain's focus and argued it
was simply electoral math.
</P>
<P>
"It's pretty clear John McCain believes he needs Iowa to win,"
said spokesman Brad Anderson.
</P>
<P>
Jerry Crawford, a veteran Democratic activist who has advised
presidential candidates for more than 20 years, said the ground
organization Obama built to help him to a surprise win in
January's caucuses has been fine-tuned since then. He said
Obama's operation was "the best presidential organization in the
history of Iowa" and noted that McCain is only now creating one.
</P>
<P>
"You can't catch up," Crawford said.
</P>
<P>
But Gov. Chet Culver, a Democrat, said McCain's problem in Iowa
has less to do with organization than where he is on the issues,
such as a new farm bill and incentives for alternative fuels.
Both are popular throughout the Midwest, and McCain opposed both.
</P>
<P>
"I think he has a lot of explaining to do," Culver said. "I don't
think the farmers and rural Iowa in particular are going to
forgive him."
