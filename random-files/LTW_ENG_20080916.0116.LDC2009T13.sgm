Candidates Shed No Light on Dim Economic Future
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., the turmoil is the product of cozy
relationships and corruption in Washington that can be cleaned up
only by "reformers" like him and running mate Gov. Sarah Palin of
Alaska.
</P>
<P>
The two presidential candidates have battled for weeks over which
one offers the most dramatic change from the current unpopular
administration. On Monday, they seized on the financial chaos to
make their cases anew but offered no new proposals.
</P>
<P>
The McCain campaign quickly released a television advertisement
after the disclosure that one financial giant, Lehman Brothers,
had filed for bankruptcy and another, Merrill Lynch &amp; Co.,
Inc., had been bought out.
</P>
<P>
"Our economy in crisis. Only proven reformers John McCain and
Sarah Palin can fix it," the ad said.
</P>
<P>
On the campaign trail in Florida, however, McCain sounded a
slightly different note when he said the fundamentals of the
economy remained "strong." The Obama campaign immediately pounced
on that as evidence that McCain is out of touch with ordinary
people.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in Saint Clair Shores, Mich., Obama's running mate, Sen.
Joe Biden, D-Del., said: "I could walk from here to Lansing, and
I wouldn't run into a single person who thought our economy was
doing well -- unless I ran into John McCain."
</P>
<P>
The growing sense of urgency about instability in the housing and
financial sectors may pressure both McCain and Obama to flesh out
economic policies that have been vague or overshadowed by a
blizzard of character attacks and negative campaigning. The past
week, for example, has included bickering over the McCain
campaign's charge that Obama was making a sexist reference to
Palin in talking about "putting lipstick on a pig."
</P>
<P>
For months, Obama has been calling for increased regulation and
accountability for financial institutions. On Monday, he issued a
statement that blamed the current administration for the problems
and implied again that as president he would push for new
regulation of the financial services sector.
</P>
<P>
"Eight years of policies that have shredded consumer protections,
loosened oversight and regulation, and encouraged outsized
bonuses to CEOs while ignoring middle-class Americans have
brought us to the most serious financial crisis since the Great
Depression," Obama's statement said.
</P>
<P>
McCain signaled some openness to increased regulation of
financial institutions to increase transparency of their dealings
-- though he was more cautious than Obama.
</P>
<P>
McCain, in a statement, said he would "replace the outdated and
ineffective patchwork quilt of regulatory oversight," but also
that a "highest priority" of his administration would be to
ensure that the U.S. "remains the pre-eminent financial market of
the world."
</P>
<P>
Such language is sometimes interpreted as a caution that too much
regulation will damage Wall Street's standing as an economic
powerhouse.
</P>
<P>
Both candidates said they supported the federal decision not to
bail out Lehman Brothers with taxpayer funding.
</P>
<P>
There are signs that Obama has not managed to capitalize on
economic anxiety as decisively as might be expected. The latest
ABC News/Washington Post poll last week showed Obama's advantage
on who would best handle the economy had dwindled to 5 percentage
points: 47 percent picked Obama, 42 percent chose McCain.
</P>
<P>
"That's shocking," said Bill Whalen, a GOP analyst at Stanford
University's Hoover Institution. "If you are a Republican, you
should be tagged on the economy. If there is such a thing as
Republican Teflon, McCain enjoys it on this matter."
</P>
<P>
But some of Obama's allies in the labor movement started trying
to scratch McCain's Teflon even before the Lehman collapse.
</P>
<P>
The AFL-CIO has sent out a mailing to about 800,000 union voters
in battleground states that attacks McCain's proposal to divert
some Social Security revenues into private stock and bond
accounts. The flier pokes fun at McCain's family fortune, his
multiple homes, even his pricey loafers and asks: "If John McCain
lost his Social Security, he'd get by just fine. Would you?"
</P>
<P>
A labor-backed group, Americans United to Protect Social
Security, is also trying to capitalize on the market turmoil to
question McCain's support for private Social Security accounts.
In a statement Monday, the group called the Lehman collapse and
the Merrill Lynch sale "perfect examples" of how a privatization
would "turn Social Security from a guarantee into a guaranteed
gamble."
