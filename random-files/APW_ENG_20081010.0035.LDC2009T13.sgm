Afghans request NATO Afghan counter-narcotics role

Afghanistan has appealed for more NATO help to attack heroin
dealers whose thriving trade is blamed for bankrolling the
widening insurgency against the pro-Western government and
international forces.
</P>
<P>
Afghan Defense Minister Gen. Abdul Rahim Wardak made the appeal
Thursday at a meeting with his NATO counterparts against the
backdrop of spreading violence that has sparked doubt about
whether Western forces can win the war against the Taliban.
</P>
<P>
"We've asked NATO to please support us, support our effort in
destroying the labs and also the interdiction of the drugs and
the chemical precursors that are coming from outside the country
for making heroin," Wardak told reporters after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Wardak's appeal follows lobbying by the United States to persuade
allies to hit back against the insurgency by striking against the
drug lords who are estimated to provide up to US$100 million
(euro72.83 million) a year to the Taliban and their al-Qaida
allies.
</P>
<P>
"If we have the opportunity to go after drug lords and drug
laboratories and try and interrupt this flow of cash to the
Taliban, that seems to me like a legitimate security endeavor,"
said U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates.
</P>
<P>
Most allies agree, but Gates complained that some allies were
balking at the plan for NATO to take on a task currently the
responsibility of Afghanistan's fledgling police force.
</P>
<P>
Germany, Spain and others are concerned that a counter-narcotics
campaign could spark a backlash against the 50,000 NATO troops
even if, as NATO commanders insist, the campaign will not target
poor farmers who depend on growing opium poppies for a living.
</P>
<P>
They also fear widening the mission could overstretch the hard-
pressed troops and undermine NATO's long-term goal of handing
more responsibility to Afghan forces. However Germany's defense
minister hinted they could change their position in the light of
Wardak's appeal.
</P>
<P>
"If this remains under Afghan leadership, it is in our own
interest to support this activity," Franz Josef Jung, told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
NATO's top diplomat said he was optimistic the 26 allies will
agree when the meeting resumes Friday.
</P>
<P>
"I hope that tomorrow morning ministers will be able to come to
some form of a conclusion," said Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop
Scheffer. "Our guys are killed by the weapons bought by the
Taliban, financed by drugs money."
</P>
<P>
Gates said one option on the table was to allow some nations who
are opposed to the plan to "opt out" without blocking others from
participating. NATO officials explained that it could, for
example, allow U.S. planes to bomb drug labs in northern
Afghanistan without involving the German troops based there.
</P>
<P>
Gates was also seeking more troops, equipment, funding and other
contributions to the Afghan war from the allies, including
training teams for the Afghan security forces which are seen as
key to an eventual withdrawal of international forces.
</P>
<P>
Reflecting concerns that Afghanistan is becoming the critical
battlefield in the fight against terrorism, the U.S. has already
said it would send about 8,000 troops to Afghanistan by early
next year. De Hoop Scheffer said several allies had come forward
with more contributions, but he declined to give details, and
said it was not enough.
</P>
<P>
"I'm not satisfied and I'm not happy about the way the allies are
performing in this regard," he told reporters, saying a lack of
helicopters and transport planes remained a particular problem.
</P>
<P>
The Afghan government is seeking talks with elements in the
Taliban leadership in an effort at reconciliation and the
Taliban's former ambassador to Pakistan said the two sides have
had contacts in Saudi Arabia. NATO says any decision to open
talks with the Taliban is up to the Afghan government, but it
will offer support.
</P>
<P>
"This is a matter for the Afghan government," de Hoop Scheffer
said.
</P>
<P>
Thirty-three thousand U.S. troops make up the bulk of the
international forces in Afghanistan, including 13,000 with the
NATO-led force, and 20,000 fighting the insurgency and training
Afghan forces outside NATO command.
