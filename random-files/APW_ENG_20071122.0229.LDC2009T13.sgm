Koreas to run train on cross-border rail everyday

North and South Korea agreed Thursday to run a cargo train
service every day on a reconnected track across their heavily
armed border starting next month, the Unification Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was a follow-up to a deal reached last week at the
first prime ministers' talks between the two sides in 15 years,
which calls for starting regular cross-border freight train
service on Dec. 11.
</P>
<P>
Working-level officials met this week to specify details,
including how often trains will run on the short track linking
the South to the North's border city of Kaesong, home to an
industrial zone for dozens of South Korean factories.
</P>
<P>
A South Korean train will make a round trip every day to the
North on the 25-kilometer-long (16-mile-long) rail, transporting
cargo to and from the factory park, the ministry said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
It would be the first regular train service between the two
sides, which were divided more than half a century ago.
</P>
<P>
South Korea hopes the inter-Korean railway will ultimately be
linked to Russia's Trans-Siberian railroad and allow an overland
route connecting the peninsula to Europe -- significantly cutting
delivery times for freight that now requires sea transport.
