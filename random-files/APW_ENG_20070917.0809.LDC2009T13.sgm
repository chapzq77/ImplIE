Three Slovenian volunteer firefighters have been detained on
suspicious of arson in 60 fires since December in a northeastern
city, a police chief said Monday.
</P>
<P>
They were detained last week and two of the suspects are 17,
Maribor police chief Marjan Fank said.
</P>
<P>
"It seems that their motive primarily was to prove their
readiness and skillfulness in putting down the fires," Fank said,
according to the state-run news agency STA.
</P>
<P>
The fires included ones at an abandoned psychiatric clinic, a
sports field under construction and a warehouse, Fank said. The
damages caused are estimated at euro750,000 (US$1 million), he
said.
</P>
<P>
If formally indicted and convicted, the three face up to eight
years in prison.
</P>
<P>
The head of the volunteers' brigade in Maribor, Milan Erzen, told
reporters they would never suspect the three of wrongdoing and
said that they were devoted firefighters.
