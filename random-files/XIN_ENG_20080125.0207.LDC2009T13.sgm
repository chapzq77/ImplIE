Some Palestinians were seen to use a bulldozer trying to open new
passages into Egypt at the Egyptian- Gaza border on Friday as
Egyptian troops moved to close the border town of Rafah, the pan-
Arab television al-Jazeera reported.

A large number of Palestinians rushed into the Egyptian side
again after the bulldozer knocked over a new section of the
border wall separating Egypt and the Gaza Strip.

Egyptian border guards shot in the air as the bulldozer continued
breaching the border wall at the small town where many
Palestinians are gathering in the streets and trying to cross
into Egypt.

TV footage showed that small scale violence occurred as water
cannons were seen fired above the heads of the gathering people
to keep them back.
