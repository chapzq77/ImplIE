SAfrican parliament rubberstamps Mbeki resignation
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
South African lawmakers rubberstamped President Thabo Mbeki's
resignation Tuesday, as he attempts to mend his bruised
reputation from charges he interfered in the prosecution of rival
Jacob Zuma.
</P>
<P>
The ANC-dominated parliament voted overwhelmingly in favour of
effecting Mbeki's resignation from Thursday, September 25, with
only 10 votes against the motion.
</P>
<P>
African National Congress deputy chief Kgalema Motlanthe was
named as the party's candidate to take over as head of state.
Parliament will on Thursday vote on his election, and he will be
sworn in later in the day.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki, who announced his resignation Sunday after pressure from
the ANC, attempted to salvage his reputation in the
Constitutional Court, as he challenged a court ruling which he
says cost him his job as president.
</P>
<P>
In a September 12 ruling, judge Chris Nicholson dismissed a
corruption case against Mbeki's political rival Jacob Zuma,
hinting that Mbeki had interfered in the decision to prosecute
his foe.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki, 66, who succeeded Nelson Mandela as president in June
1999, becomes the country's first democratically elected
president to be forced out of office before the end of his term.
</P>
<P>
"It is unfair and unjust for me to be judged and condemned on the
basis of the findings in the Zuma matter," said Mbeki in his
application.
</P>
<P>
"The interests of justice, in my respectful submission would
demand that the matter be rectified," he added.
</P>
<P>
"These adverse findings have led to my being recalled by my
political party, the ANC -- a request I have acceded to as a
committed and loyal member of the ANC for the past 52 years,"
Mbeki said.
</P>
<P>
"I fear that if not rectified, I might suffer further prejudice,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
The court ruling that was to prove Mbeki's final downfall found
that the executive might have interfered in the decision to
prosecute the ANC chief.
</P>
<P>
"I am not convinced that the applicant (Zuma) was incorrect in
averring political meddling in his prosecution," said Nicholson.
</P>
<P>
He was ruling on an application by the state to strike out
sections of an affidavit filed by Zuma's legal team that
insinuated political interference in the decision to charge him.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki had been increasingly at loggerheads with his party, which
split into two camps behind him and Zuma, after deciding to run
for a third term as party president at a crunch ANC conference in
December last year.
</P>
<P>
Zuma toppled him as chief at the conference, and is the
frontronner to be president after elections in April 2009.
</P>
<P>
The ruling throwing out corruption charges against Zuma led to a
week of heavy political debate, and a lengthy meeting by the ANC
executive who decided on Saturday to "recall" Mbeki in the
interests of party unity.
</P>
<P>
When announcing his resignation in a live address on Sunday,
Mbeki denied he had " compromised the right of the National
Prosecuting Authority (NPA) to decide whom it should prosecute
and not prosecute."
</P>
<P>
Following Mbeki's resignation, Deputy President Phumzile Mlambo-
Ngcuka, Minister in the Presidency Essop Pahad, and Science
Minister Mosibudi Mangena have also tendered their resignations.
</P>
<P>
According to Fitch Ratings, Mbeki's resignation adds a level of
political uncertainty to South Africa's economy already
challenged on both international and domestic fronts.
</P>
<P>
"The interim president and his or her team will have to carefully
manage the transition so as to not worsen already weak investor
sentiment and add to macroeconomic risks," it said.
</P>
<P>
Motlanthe, who will take over from Thursday as president, is
considered a key ANC strategist who has appealed to supporters of
both Mbeki and the outgoing president's rival Jacob Zuma.
</P>
<P>
"Motlanthe will be the president, not interim, he will be the
president of the republic until the election," spokesman for the
ANC parliamentary caucus KK Khumalo told AFP.
