Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert on Sunday politely turned down
an offer by Pakistan's President Gen. Pervez Musharraf to serve
as a go-between Israel and the Palestinians.

<P>
Speaking in a radio interview, Olmert said he preferred to
maintain direct contacts with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas
and not depend on an intermediary. "We don't need someone to come
from afar in order for me and Abu Mazen to meet," he said,
referring to Abbas.
</P>
<P>
Musharraf made the surprise offer Friday in an interview with the
Arab satellite station Al-Arabiya. He told the Dubai-based
station that he would even be willing to visit the Jewish state
to help bring peace to the Middle East.

<P>
Pakistan -- a key ally in the U.S.-led war against terrorism --
has no formal diplomatic ties with Israel.
