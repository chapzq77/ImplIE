Afghan and U.S.-led coalition soldiers battled Taliban militants
in Afghanistan and called in airstrikes, in fighting that killed
more than 20 insurgents, the coalition said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The battles on Tuesday and Wednesday came after Afghan forces
claimed to have killed a Taliban commander involved in the
kidnapping of 23 South Korean church workers in central
Afghanistan in July.

Afghan and coalition soldiers in Shah Wali Kot district, in
southern Kandahar province, came under attack while on patrol
Tuesday. They fought back before calling in support from the
skies, a coalition statement said.
</P>
<P>
"Surgical and precision airstrikes were carried out on positively
identified enemy positions from where machine gun and rocket-
propelled grenade fire was originating," it said. "Over a dozen
insurgents were killed in this engagement."

About 30 kilometers (18 miles) away, insurgents sheltering in a
traditional low-walled Afghan compound attacked another joint
patrol on Tuesday. Airstrikes later pounded the position, killing
six insurgents, the statement said.

Taliban-led militants are waging a bloody resistance campaign
against the Western-supported government of President Hamid
Karzai, which replaced the hard-line Islamic militia after the
U.S. invasion in 2001.
</P>
<P>
In Ghazni province, insurgents early Wednesday attacked a joint
coalition and Afghan force, triggering a clash that left "several
militants" dead, a coalition statement said. A number of
civilians were injured in the clash, the coalition said.

On Tuesday, Afghan officials claimed to have killed a Taliban
commander called Mullah Mateen, who they said was involved the
kidnapping of the South Koreans on July 19. The Taliban denied
the claim.
</P>
<P>
Two of the captives were killed soon after the kidnapping, two
were released in August, while the remaining 19 were freed last
week after Seoul repeated a long-standing commitment to withdraw
its 200 troops by year's end, and prevent Christian missionaries
from traveling to Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Afghan authorities often make claims that they have killed
Taliban commanders that turn out to be false. Taliban spokesmen
have also downplayed or lied about the extent of their
battlefield losses.
