Leader of top US civil rights group resigns
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People --
the oldest and best-known US civil rights group -- announced
Monday that its president, Bruce Gordon, has resigned just 19
months after taking the job.
</P>
<P>
"The NAACP is sad to announce the resignation of CEO Bruce
Gordon," the Baltimore, Maryland based group said in a press
release.
</P>
<P>
NAACP Board Chairman Julian Bond went on in the statement to
"wish Mr. Gordon well in his future pursuits."
</P>
<P>
Gordon, a former senior executive at Verizon, is credited with
reversing a precipitous membership slide in the African-American
rights group, which counts some 300,000 members in its ranks, but
as recently as a decade ago boasted about a half-million.
</P>
<P>
No official reason was given for Gordon's departure, but US media
reported that he clashed repeatedly with board members over
charting a new direction for the group, management style and
other matters.
</P>
<P>
NAACP officials said the group's general counsel, Dennis Hayes,
has been named interim president, and that the search for
Gordon's successor would begin without delay.
</P>
<P>
"We will immediately begin a widespread search for a replacement,
examining candidates from the non-profit, corporate, and civil
rights communities and others, seeking a new president who can
insure our mission of social justice advocacy strengthens and
grows as we approach our centennial anniversary in 2009," Bond
said.
