MOGADISHU, Nov. 5 (Xinhua)
</P>
<P>
Three Somali government security forces were killed and a number
of other people were wounded Monday in separate attacks in the
capital, Mogadishu, while several mortar rounds were slammed into
an Ethiopian military base in the city as reinforcement for the
Ethiopian troops pour into the Somali capital, witnesses said.

<P>
Two soldiers were killed when assailants threw a hand grenade at
an army base in Medina district in the west of Mogadishu and an
unknown number of civilians were wounded after the troops fired
in response, Yusuf Gedi, a witnesses, told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
"I saw two dead soldiers being put into an army van after the
blast," said Gedi. "The soldiers fired at the direction of the
attackers and many people were wounded."
</P>
<P>
Residents said the attackers escaped from the scene and the
soldiers cordoned off the area and started searches.
</P>
<P>
Separately, a government policeman on patrol in Baad market in
the north of the Somali capital was killed and his gun taken by
suspected Islamist insurgents armed with pistols.
</P>
<P>
"They shot him twice in the head. Then they took his gun away
after he fell to the ground," Ali Gure, a businessman at the
market, told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Traders at the market said government forces arrived at the site
of the attack minutes after the attackers left. The police began
questioning bystanders and searching for the assailants.
</P>
<P>
Businesses activities at the market were mainly stopped as
business people closed their shops.
</P>
<P>
Somali government officials, who do not often speak to the media
on security matters, were not readily available for comment.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a number of mortar rounds hit Ethiopian troops based
in a former pasta factory building in Huruwa district in the
south of the restive city, witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian troops, who have been receiving daily attacks from
insurgents opposed to their presence in Somalia, are deployed in
the country following their crossing of the border last December
to help the interim government oust an Islamist movement in
control in southern and central Somalia.
</P>
<P>
The troops were getting reinforcement for the past week after
days of fierce battles in Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
Huge columns of Ethiopian military trucks carrying troops and
military supplies have been coming from the southern Somali town
of Baidoa, the seat of the transitional federal parliament,
towards the capital, residents along Mogadishu- Baidoa Road said.
</P>
<P>
A number of roadside bombs targeted the convoys along the road
this week but it is not clear if the blasts left any casualties
on the Ethiopian military.
