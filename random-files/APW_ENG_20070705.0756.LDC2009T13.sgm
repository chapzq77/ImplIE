Police have detained a man in eastern Belgium after a dinner
guest found the bodies of the host's wife and stepson in the deep
freeze, authorities said Thursday.

<P>
The female guest opened the freezer while helping to clear up
after a dinner with a group of friends Tuesday at the man's home
in the city of Verviers, 125 kilometers (78 miles) east of
Brussels, said Christine Wilwerth of the city prosecutor's
office.

"It was a lady who at the end of the meal at a friend's house,
and after washing the dishes ... decided to take the leftovers of
the meal down to the basement to store in the deep freeze,"
Wilwerth said. "Once she opened the deep freeze, she discovered
the bodies."
</P>
<P>
Guests alerted police, who identified the bodies of the man's
wife and her 12-year-old son. The bodies appeared to have been
kept in the deep freeze for several weeks.

<P>
Wilwerth said the suspect acknowledged that a domestic quarrel
had escalated and his wife received stab wounds, but she said he
had not explained the circumstances of the child's death.
