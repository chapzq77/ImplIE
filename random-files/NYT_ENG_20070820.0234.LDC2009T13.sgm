<HEADLINE>
RATE HIKE LOOMS FOR MANY TEXAS ALLSTATE POLICYHOLDERS

Allstate Texas Lloyds is raising home insurance rates 5.9 percent
statewide, the company said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Coastal residents in counties once and twice removed from the
Gulf of Mexico, such as Harris and Montgomery counties, will also
see an additional average 2 percent rate hike.
</P>
<P>
That's to help cover the cost of reinsurance, or insurance the
company buys for itself to help pay for claims in the event of a
catastrophe, the company said.
</P>
<P>
Residents of Galveston County and a sliver of Harris County will
not be hit with the average 2 percent increase because the
company dropped windstorm coverage in counties that touch coastal
waters last year.
</P>
<P>
The rates will change on policies as they come up for renewal,
Allstate said. Rising construction costs also contributed to the
rate hike, the company said.
</P>
<P>
About 700,000 of Allstate's 917,000 Texas policyholders are
insured by Allstate Texas Lloyds.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, Allstate withdrew a proposed 6.9 percent
statewide increase in homeowners rates after the Texas Department
of Insurance signaled that it wouldn't approve rates.
</P>
<P>
"Updated information indicated a slightly reduced rate change,"
said Bill Mellander, a spokesman for Allstate. The range of rates
coastal residents will pay was not available, he said.
</P>
<P>
Insurance companies in Texas are allowed to implement their rate
increases upon filing them with regulators without prior
approval. However, regulators can disapprove the rates after
they've been implemented and order refunds.
</P>
<P>
Rod Bordelon, of the Texas Office of Public Insurance Counsel
that represents consumers, said he anticipates the office will
oppose the rates.
</P>
<P>
"I see no basis for any such increase," said Bordelon, the public
counsel. "We're still looking at it."
</P>
<P>
Jerry Hagins, the spokesman for the Texas Department of
Insurance, said Monday his office is reviewing the actuarial
information to see if the hike is justified. He said that if
Bordelon opposes the increase "that opinion has a great deal of
weight to it."
</P>
<P>
Allstate stopped selling new homeowners policies in counties once
removed from the coast -- such as Harris, Fort Bend and Liberty
-- in March 2006 and dropped windstorm insurance for
policyholders in September 2006 in counties that front the Gulf
of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
Farmers which also withdrew proposed rate increases last month in
anticipation of opposition from the state has yet to file a new
proposal, a spokeswoman said.
