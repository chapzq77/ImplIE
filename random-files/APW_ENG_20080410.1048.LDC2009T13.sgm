<P>
Arsenal midfielder Mathieu Flamini was ruled out for three weeks
Thursday because of an ankle injury, hitting the club's challenge
for the Premier League title.
</P>
<P>
Flamini, who has been a key part of the team this season, was
hurt in Tuesday's 4-2 Champions League loss at Liverpool and
could now miss the next three matches, including a crucial trip
to leader Manchester United on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Gilberto Silva came on as a substitute for Flamini on Tuesday and
is likely to fill in for the French midfielder, who could be set
to leave Arsenal when his contract expires at the end of the
season.
</P>
<P>
Arsenal is six points behind Man United, the defending champions,
with five games remaining, suggesting that victory on Sunday is
essential to keep it in contention.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Arsenal reserve goalkeeper Jens Lehmann said in
Thursday's edition of Kicker magazine that he is "very angry" at
being left out of Tuesday's team.
</P>
<P>
Lehmann has spent most of the season as understudy to Manuel
Almunia, who conceded four goals in the second leg at Anfield as
Arsenal lost 5-3 on aggregate to Liverpool.
</P>
<P>
Lehmann said he didn't think Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger was
right to leave him out.
</P>
<P>
"The results speak against it," he said.
</P>
<P>
The 38-year-old Lehmann, who remains Germany's No. 1 goalkeeper,
said he had decided to remain with Arsenal in the hope of winning
the Champions League.
</P>
<P>
"I saw a good chance (for me) to play. That I didn't get it makes
me very angry," Lehmann said.
</P>
<P>
Asked if he had been give a "fair chance" against Almunia,
Lehmann replied: "No, I don't think so. If the coach had told me
before the season, I could have decided if I wanted to sit on the
bench or not."
</P>
<P>
Lehmann said he might continue playing next season if he got to
play in the Champions League again.
