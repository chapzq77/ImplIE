Thousands of Georgians are rallying in an emphatic show of
support for President Mikhail Saakashvili after the country came
under attack from Russian forces.
</P>
<P>
Red and white Georgian flags fluttered over the crowd in central
Tbilsi, which filled a square and nearby streets as far as the
eye could see.
</P>
<P>
People held posters saying "I love Georgia" and "I love you
Misha" -- the familiar form of the president's first name.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Prime Minister Gia Baramidze told the crowd they should
hold their flags high and stand together, saying "we shouldn't be
afraid of the enemy."
</P>
<P>
Russian President Dmitry Medvedev ordered a halt to the military
action Tuesday, but it was unclear whether all fighting had
stopped.
