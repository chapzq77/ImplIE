U.S. defends controversial nuclear deal with India

WASHINGTON, Oct. 16 (Xinhua)
</P>
<P>
The United States said Tuesday that the controversial nuclear
deal with India is "not dead" amid reports saying that the deal
appears close to collapse.
</P>
<P>
"India is a thriving democracy and they have work to do and they
may need some additional time on their end to get their part of
this deal done," White House spokesman Tony Fratto said.
</P>
<P>
"The president is willing and is very understanding that the
Indians may need more time for this. But no, it's not -- it's not
dead," Fratto said.
</P>
<P>
According to a report by the Washington Post Tuesday, Indian
Prime Minister Manmohan Singh told U.S. President George W. Bush
on Monday that "certain difficulties" would prevent India from
moving forward on the pact for the foreseeable future.
</P>
<P>
Besieged over the past two months by growing opposition to
nuclear energy cooperation with the United States, Singh
indicated over the weekend that he would rather save his
coalition government than the nuclear pact, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The United States and India reached a historic agreement on civil
nuclear cooperation in March 2006, under which India will get
access to U.S. civil nuclear technology, and open its nuclear
facilities for inspection.
</P>
<P>
Bush in December 2006 signed into law a bill approved by
Congress, a major step toward letting India buy U.S. nuclear
reactors and fuel for the first time in 30 years.
</P>
<P>
But U.S. Congress attached several conditions to the law and the
two countries have returned to negotiations. According to the
conditions, the United States would be required to end the export
of nuclear materials if India tests another nuclear device. India
had nuclear tests in 1998.
</P>
<P>
It also does not guarantee uninterrupted fuel supplies for
reactors and prevents India from reprocessing spent fuel. Indian
critics say the agreement will put restrictions on the country's
nuclear weapons program.
