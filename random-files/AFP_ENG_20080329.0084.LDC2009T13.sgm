Football: Unstoppable Ronaldo keeps United on a roll
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cristiano Ronaldo continued his outstanding campaign with a goal
and three assists as Manchester United cruised to victory over
Aston Villa to open up a six-point gap at the head of the Premier
League.
</P>
<P>
Wayne Rooney, twice, and Carlos Tevez were the players to benefit
from the winger's service in a game that confirmed the scale of
the task facing Arsenal and Chelsea if they are to overhaul the
reigning champions.
</P>
<P>
This was the perfect response to Arsenal's impressively resilient
victory at Bolton earlier in the day that appeared to revive the
London club title claims.
</P>
<P>
That win meant United kicked off just three points ahead of
Arsene Wenger's side and, with Chelsea set to face Middlesbrough
the following day, anything less than three points would have
given the three-way battle at the head of the table a new twist.
</P>
<P>
As it was Ferguson's side didn't just get the job done, they
triumphed in a style that will undoubtedly suggested there is
little chance of them throwing away such a commanding lead at
this stage of the season.
</P>
<P>
So comfortable was this win that Ferguson could afford to make
three substitutions early in the second half when his side was
already leading 3-0 to ensure fresh legs for the trip to face
Roma in the Champions League quarter- final first leg in the
Italian capital on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
An impressive early start from Villa suggested Martin O'Neill's
side could make a contest of the game and possibly boost their
own hopes of qualifying for next season's UEFA Cup.
</P>
<P>
But from the moment Ronaldo produced an impudent back-heel flick
from ten yards out to divert the ball through Martin Laursen's
legs and beyond Scott Carson for the 17th minute opener, United
were almost completely in control.
</P>
<P>
The home side's supremacy was confirmed 12 minutes before the
interval when an exhilarating move took the ball from United's
right hand flank to the left and back again before Ronaldo
delivered a perfectly weighted far post cross that Tevez headed
home.
</P>
<P>
Villa already looked a beaten side but they did at least rally
after half-time, applying a brief period of pressure and, after
Rooney had missed a sitter at the other end, should have scored
when substitute Shaun Maloney pulled the ball wide when clear on
Tomasz Kuzsczak's goal.
</P>
<P>
But that simply stirred United back into life and it took a
superb reaction save from Villa keeper Carson to divert Ronaldo's
volley onto the cross bar and deny the Portugese a second goal.
</P>
<P>
That was only a brief reprieve for the visitors and within 60
seconds United had their third when Ronaldo again turned
provider, flicking a long pass into the path of Rooney who
rounded Carson and rolled the ball into an empty net.
</P>
<P>
And the England striker claimed his second, again courtesy of his
in-form team- mate, when he collected Ronaldo's neat reverse pass
and finished from close range.
