Virginia Left Behind: Opting Out of No Child Left Behind Would Be
a Costly Mistake

The following editorial appeared in Thursday's Washington Post:

Legislation is progressing in the Virginia General Assembly that
would pull the state out of the No Child Left Behind law's
oversight. No matter that the law has helped boost student
learning and narrow the achievement gap, that schools are more
accountable, and that students who go to failing schools now have
options. Not even the threatened loss of millions of dollars in
federal education aid seems to worry lawmakers more intent on
making political points than good public policy.

Both the House and Senate passed bills that would drop Virginia
from the federal education program unless the U.S. Education
Department waives some requirements. The legislation directs the
state Board of Education to come up with a plan for withdrawal,
with one version even setting a deadline of June 30, 2009. Del.
R. Steven Landes, R-Augusta, a sponsor of the House bill, said
that he hopes to clarify it so that the legislature would have to
act again to sign off on any withdrawal. The bills are in
conference, where one hopes that they will die as the legislature
rushes to adjourn. Gov. Timothy M. Kaine, D, has said he won't
support the measure, and the state board, while wanting more
flexibility, doesn't favor a state withdrawal. They undoubtedly
are mindful that Virginia would stand to lose an estimated $300
million a year, a hole in the state budget that couldn't be
tolerated. Nonetheless, the bills passed by overwhelming margins,
a product of Republicans averse to f!

ederal involvement and Democrats mindful of teachers unions'
opposition to No Child Left Behind. The result could produce the
dubious distinction of Virginia becoming the first state to try
to opt out of the landmark bill.

The initiative isn't all that surprising, given Virginia's past
complaints about the law and the state's efforts to seek
exemptions. Most notable was its ill-advised rebellion over the
testing of children with limited proficiency in English. The
state eventually backed down in the face of a loss of federal
funds, but the reluctance to hold all students to the same
standards says much about why No Child Left Behind is needed. The
federal law surely has flaws, but Virginia lawmakers are kidding
themselves in claiming that state practices are sufficient. Until
No Child Left Behind came along, school districts were able to
mask the low achievement of poor and minority students, there was
no recourse for parents and children in failing schools, and no
one was held accountable. In passing the measures, lawmakers
talked about sending a message to Washington. Too bad it's one
that ignores the interests of children.
