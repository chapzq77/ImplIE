Global Food Crisis: A Return to Wheat?
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Whether 2008's high prices will lure many farmers back to wheat
is still a matter of debate.
</P>
<P>
The ethanol boom, in particular, is providing strong incentives
to keep former wheat acres in corn. Within a year, David Braaten,
a farmer in Kindred, N.D., will be able to truck his corn to
three modern ethanol refineries, one already built and two others
near completion. These huge distilleries will need corn from an
area about the size of Rhode Island, and many of the acres will
come at the expense of such traditional crops as wheat and sugar
beets.
</P>
<P>
Corn has even begun to make inroads in the western part of the
state, where sparse rainfall and the short growing season
traditionally have ruled out most crops except wheat, barley and
oats. Spurred by the availability of cheap coal for power and a
local cattle industry that will buy the dry byproducts for feed,
a new ethanol plant opened last year in Richardton, west of
Bismarck, the capital.
</P>
<P>
"There's getting to be more and more corn all the time," said
Clark Holzwarth, the refinery's commodity manager.
</P>
<P>
At current prices, farmers like Braaten can make more money from
an acre of corn than from an acre of wheat, according to North
Dakota State University economist Dwight Aakre. But wheat's
biggest problem is susceptibility to disease, which has turned
many farmers against it.
</P>
<P>
They remember the 1990s, when fusarium head blight, commonly
called "scab," devastated successive wheat crops. After that,
many farmers switched to new varieties of hybrid corn and
genetically modified soybeans.
</P>
<P>
These seeds are protected by patents and licensing agreements,
requiring farmers to buy a new batch each year. That produces
strong financial incentives for the companies. Research might
solve many of wheat's problems, but commercial companies say the
opportunities for profit are limited. In 2004, Monsanto, the
world's largest seed company, shelved its research on a wheat
plant that had been genetically modified to tolerate chemical
weed killers.
</P>
<P>
The milling industry has been resistant to using such genetically
modified wheats, so wheat plants have to be improved the old-
fashioned way, by laboriously selecting those with the desired
qualities in test plots. That is an expensive and time-consuming
process.
</P>
<P>
Even then, there is no assurance that farmers will buy the seed
year after year. That is because of the nature of the wheat
plant, an unusually complex organism originating in the Middle
East thousands of years ago. Unlike hybrid corn, which loses its
productivity after the first year, seeds from improved wheat
varieties can be saved and replanted for several years without
significant loss of yield.
</P>
<P>
Syngenta, a large seed company, is still working to improve
wheat, but Rob Bruns, who heads the North American cereal seed
operation, acknowledged that it's difficult to create "enough
critical mass to pay for the higher tech investments."
</P>
<P>
The upshot is that most wheat research is now consigned to public
colleges with limited amounts of federal and state funds.
</P>
<P>
At North Dakota State University, wheat breeder Mohamed Mergoum
helped develop Glenn, a new wheat based on a cross with Chinese
plants. "It's a joy to make a difference in the life of the
growers," said Mergoum, who worked earlier in the international
program that developed higher-yielding "green revolution" wheats.
</P>
<P>
Glenn has proved resistant to scab, but it hasn't achieved
universal acceptance among farmers.
</P>
<P>
Don Strickler, a farmer in Euclid, Minn., gave it a try one year
but stopped using it after finding that a lot of the kernels
cracked when they were separated from the chaff during threshing.
As he sees it, Glenn is another example of how devilishly
difficult it is to develop positive new traits in wheat without
other problems arising.
</P>
<P>
James A. Anderson, a plant breeder at the University of
Minnesota, predicted that the seed companies will continue to
make inroads in wheat country with new kinds of corn and
soybeans.
</P>
<P>
"They've definitely moved into the spring-wheat region with
dedicated breeding," he said. "They're trying to get whatever
acreage they can and sell more of their seed."
