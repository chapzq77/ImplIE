Attacks on journalists in the Philippines are undermining press
freedom and putting the country's democracy "under siege," the
country's Supreme Court chief justice warned Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Reporters also face harassment through abuse of defamation and
libel laws, Chief Justice Reynato Puno said.
</P>
<P>
"It is a dangerous time for those who report the truth," Puno
said in a speech at an international conference in Manila on
press freedom.
</P>
<P>
"Democracy is all about the voice of the people," Puno said.
"Democracy in this country is under siege because bullets fired
at the direction of journalists pierce not only human flesh, but
also our republican ideals."
</P>
<P>
Since 1986, when democracy was restored after dictator Ferdinand
Marcos' ouster in a "people power" revolt, 70 journalists have
been killed in the Philippines, according to the Manila-based
Center for Media Freedom and Responsibility, one of the
organizers of the conference.
</P>
<P>
The number of journalists murdered is the fifth-highest in the
world, Puno said, citing 1992-2008 figures from the New York-
based Committee to Protect Journalists.
</P>
<P>
Puno decried "censorship by killing" and the harassment of
democracy advocates, especially journalists.
</P>
<P>
"It is this enforced silence that we ought to break, for if there
is anything that democracy can ill afford it is the sovereignty
of the deaf and the dumb," he said.
</P>
<P>
Media and human rights groups have accused the administration of
President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo of suppressing the press,
citing most recently an incident in which two busloads of
journalists who covered a failed coup on Nov. 29 were rounded up
by police for several hours. Officials said the journalists
refused to leave the site of the attempted coup despite warnings
and hampered police operations.
</P>
<P>
Arroyo has denied accusations of media harassment, citing efforts
by her government to stop the growing number of killings of
journalists and left-wing activists.
</P>
<P>
In October, the Justice Department ordered the speedy resolution
of cases of human rights violations and killings allegedly
committed by "agents of the state."
</P>
<P>
The chief justice said only one of 33 cases filed in connection
with the killings of journalists has been resolved. Six are
undergoing trial, 18 are still under investigation, four have
been dismissed and four are pending prosecution.
