Singapore key exports drop 17.5 percent in November: govt

Singapore's key exports tumbled 17.5 percent in November from a
year ago as shipments to the recession-hit United States and
Europe fell, the government said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Last month's drop in non-oil domestic exports (NODX) was worse
than the 15.4 percent fall posted in October, and marked the
seventh month they have fallen in the city-state's trade-oriented
economy, which is already in recession.
</P>
<P>
It was also worse than the average 15 percent slide tipped by
analysts in a Dow Jones Newswires poll.
</P>
<P>
NODX was worth 12.06 billion Singapore dollars (7.83 billion US)
last month.
</P>
<P>
On a month-on-month seasonally adjusted basis, key exports
declined 2.8 percent in November, said International Enterprise
Singapore, the trade promotion agency.
</P>
<P>
Total trade fell 10.6 percent last month to 66.6 billion dollars,
it said.
</P>
<P>
Shipments to Europe plunged 25.6 percent to 1.75 billion dollars
while those to the United States dropped 27.4 percent to 1.56
billion dollars, the trade agency said. Both destinations are
major markets for Singapore.
</P>
<P>
Overall NODX shipments to Singapore's 10 biggest markets,
including the United States and Europe, declined in November, it
said.
</P>
<P>
Electronic exports sank 17.3 percent to 4.9 billion dollars last
month while non-electronics, which include drugs and
petrochemicals, dropped 17.6 percent to 7.1 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Singapore's official growth forecast for 2008 has been slashed to
about 2.5 percent, but Minister for Trade and Industry Lim Hng
Kiang said the target looks unattainable.
</P>
<P>
"Singapore is a very small, open economy and therefore the
economy is very volatile and very vulnerable to global
conditions," Lim told reporters Tuesday on the sidelines of a
regional economic meeting.
</P>
<P>
"We are looking at a very difficult trade environment... So I am
afraid the economy will come in lower than what we expected," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Singapore's economy, valued at 243 billion dollars in 2007, is
heavily dependent on external demand which makes it vulnerable to
any slip-ups in the global economy.
</P>
<P>
For 2009, the government forecasts the economy could contract by
1.0 percent or grow as much as 2.0 percent.
</P>
<P>
Joseph Tan, chief regional economist with Credit Suisse, said
Singapore will struggle to meet the high end of the government's
2009 forecast because the external environment will deteriorate
further.
</P>
<P>
"We know for a fact the orders from the US and other developed
countries have been bad so it's a matter of time before it starts
to affect the trade figures for Asia," said Tan.
</P>
<P>
"We haven't been able to turn the corner on this financial
crisis... I would expect the NODX figures to continue to
deteriorate," he said.
</P>
<P>
Singapore was the first Asian economy to sink into a recession
after two straight quarters of economic contraction, government
figures released in October showed.
