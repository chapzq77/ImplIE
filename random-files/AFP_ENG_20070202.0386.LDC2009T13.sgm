British broadcaster pulls sex shows after 'Bullywood' furore
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
British broadcaster Channel 4 said Friday it would shelve a
series of sex programmes after facing a storm of criticism over
the "Celebrity Big Brother" race row.
</P>
<P>
A three-show season of programmes dubbed "Wank Week," including a
"masturbate-a-thon," has been ditched, although a spokeman
insisted they would be aired "in due course."
</P>
<P>
The move comes after glamorous Bollywood actress Shilpa Shetty
suffered alleged racist bullying on the reality television show,
sparking condemnation from around the world.
</P>
<P>
The so-called "Bullywood" row drew in top politicians in Britain
and India, while Ofcom, Britain's media regulator, is reviewing
the channel's funding after receiving its biggest number of
complaints.
</P>
<P>
London Mayor Ken Livingstone attacked programme makers for
"deliberately" broadcasting racist comments.
</P>
<P>
Channel 4 wants a slice of the publicly-funded television licence
fee -- viewers currently pay 131.50 pounds (260 dollars, 200
euros) per year for BBC services.
</P>
<P>
The money would pay for the switchover from analogue to digital
broadcasting, which will take place gradually from November 2007
up to 2012.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile the row over "Celebrity Big Brother" continued to burn.
</P>
<P>
One of Shetty's three alleged tormentors, glamour model Danielle
Lloyd, has met police for a three-hour discussion about the race
row, her spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
A second, former S Club singer Jo O'Meara, issued a lengthy
public statement saying she was "shattered and totally
devastated" by the show's fallout but insisted she was not asking
for pity.
