Suspected separatist insurgents in Thailand's turbulent Muslim
south have shot dead a policeman and a civilian, police said
Wednesday, as the official death toll topped 2,300.

In Pattani province on Wednesday, a 41-year-old sergeant major
was shot dead and his pregnant wife wounded, while on Tuesday in
nearby Yala province a 37-year- old food seller was killed by
gunfire.

Local police in the south told AFP that as of Tuesday, 2,312
people had been killed in the bloody insurgency plaguing the area
since violence erupted in 2004. The figure included militants
killed in the unrest.
</P>
<P>
Despite an upsurge in violence, army-appointed Prime Minister
Surayud Chulanont insisted that his government would adhere to a
peaceful approach.
</P>
<P>
"My government has declared the unrest in the south as a top
priority that needs urgent address, and my government still holds
on to peaceful means," he told a gathering of hundreds of
Japanese investors in Bangkok.
</P>
<P>
"The problem in the south is complicated and it cannot be solved
overnight," he said.
</P>
<P>
The violence has continued despite peace-building measures by
Surayud, who came to power following a coup in September 2006.

The Muslim-majority region was once an autonomous sultanate,
until it was annexed by mainly Buddhist Thailand a century ago.
Separatist unrest has erupted there periodically ever since.
