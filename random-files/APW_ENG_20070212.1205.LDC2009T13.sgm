Three Saudi border security men were wounded, two seriously, in
exchanges of gunfire Monday near the border with Yemen, the Saudi
Interior Ministry spokesman said.

Two men in a speeding car driving toward Yemen opened fire with
machine guns on the border guards at the Wadiaa checkpoint on the
Saudi side of the border, said Gen. Mansour al-Turki, the
spokesman, in a statement carried by the official Saudi Press
Agency.

The guards returned fire, seized the vehicle and detained the two
men, the statement said. It did not give the nationalities of the
men in the car or any information on what was in the car.

<P>
Saudi officials believe most of the weapons used in militant
operations in Saudi Arabia -- including some suicide attacks --
were smuggled from Yemen, an impoverished country at the southern
tip of the Arabian peninsula that has long been awash in small
arms.
