Robert Rubin, new head of world's top bank
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Robert Rubin, named chairman of the world's biggest banking group
Citigroup Sunday, is a former secretary of the US Treasury
credited with boosting the United States' economy in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
He was hailed as an economic hero by Time magazine, one of three
influential economists credited with saving markets from the
late-1990s Asian financial crash and setting Wall Street on top
of the world.
</P>
<P>
The other two were his Treasury successor Larry Summers and
former Federal Reserve chief Alan Greenspan.
</P>
<P>
Rubin replaces Charles Prince, who resigned Sunday, paying
personally for the group's poor performance in the subprime
mortgage crisis, The Wall Street Journal reported.
</P>
<P>
He was until now the influential chairman of Citigroup's
executive committee.
</P>
<P>
The 69-year-old New Yorker and graduate of Harvard and Yale
started out in banking with the business lender Goldman Sachs in
1966, later to become one of its four partners.
</P>
<P>
Jay Tenenbaum, one of the Goldman Sachs bosses who first hired
him, has said Rubin has a remarkable tolerance to risk. Former
colleague Stephen Friedman describes him as a pragmatist.
</P>
<P>
A committed Democrat, he left Wall Street in 1993 to join the
administration of Bill Clinton as the then-president's economic
policy adviser and head of the National Economic Council.
</P>
<P>
He was named head of the Treasury in 1995, where he set about
promoting a stronger dollar and helped the United States weather
the Mexican financial crisis in 1995 and the Asian crash of 1997.
</P>
<P>
He joined Citigroup in 1999 after quitting the Treasury and
returning to New York to spend more time with his family.
</P>
<P>
He worked on the bank's strategic and operational activities, and
was regarded as the closest adviser of Prince, his outgoing boss.
