A missing suitcase containing potentially lethal radioactive
geological material was found on Thursday, in front of a suburban
school near Spain's capital Madrid, a police source said.  A
local neighbour raised the alarm after she found the bright
yellow case marked "radioactive" on Thursday morning outside the
secondary school.

<P>
Police cordoned off the area and recovered the suitcase intact, a
Madrid police spokeswoman told AFP.

Spain's nuclear safety agency (CSN) issued an alert on Wednesday,
a day after the material went missing, presumed stolen.
</P>
<P>
It warned the public of the dangers of opening the suitcase,
saying it contained "two sources of low-level radioactivity".
</P>
<P>
The material could "pose risks if it is opened or if the
equipment is destroyed," the CSN warned.
</P>
<P>
The case was part of a kit for geologists to measure the density
and humidity of the earth.
