BEIJING, April 12 (Xinhua)
</P>
<P>
China on Thursday voiced deep concern over the latest situation
in Kyrgyzstan, calling for international efforts to play a
constructive role in maintaining stability in the country.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry spokesman Qin Gang made the remarks when asked
to comment on whether the current situation in Kyrgyzstan would
affect a summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) to
be scheduled in the country's capital Bishkek in August.
</P>
<P>
According to reports, thousands of opposition members launched
protests and rallies since April 9 to press President Kurmanbek
Bakiyev to step down. The president's decree last December to
reverse several constitutional amendments and recover the
authority to form the cabinet had triggered anger among
opposition members.
</P>
<P>
Qin said the August summit is very important for the SCO
development, noting the member states agreed to give full support
to Kyrgyzstan, who is the present SCO's rotating chair, to well
prepare for the summit.
</P>
<P>
He said China sincerely hopes that Kyrgyzstan keep stability and
develop its economy, and its people live a better life.
</P>
<P>
This is in the fundamental interests of the people in and beyond
Kyrgyzstan, Qin added.
