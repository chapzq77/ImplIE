O.T. ISN ' T AS SIMPLE AS TELLING TIME
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A woman in a Chicago workplace caused quite a stir recently when
she submitted her time sheet. She had worked 800 hours of
overtime in 17 weeks, meaning she had been on the job about 12 or
13 hours a day, seven days a week, January through April.
</P>
<P>
Because the woman, Carla Bird, is an assistant at Oprah Winfrey's
production company, Harpo Studios, and because some seemingly
jealous co-workers spread the word to the news media, her $32,000
payout was the talk of those who pay attention to workload for a
living. The work/life experts were predictably appalled that Bird
had logged so many hours.
</P>
<P>
And the labor lawyers?
</P>
<P>
They were impressed -- that she had actually collected her
overtime pay.
</P>
<P>
Time was when overtime was extra money for extra work, which in
its simplest form it still is, but there is nothing simple about
it anymore. In today's perpetual workplace, where downtime has
merged with work time, where you can carry your office in your
pocket, where collars are no longer distinctly blue or white, how
does one measure overtime?
</P>
<P>
Most states have dense rules about overtime, of course, and the
federal government has the Fair Labor Standards Act, which says
that unless you are an "exempt worker" you must be paid time and
a half after a 40-hour workweek.
</P>
<P>
It is worth noting that the language is backward when it comes to
overtime. Usually "exempt" is a relief, as in "exempt" from jury
duty. But here it means you are not entitled to overtime under
the law.
</P>
<P>
The multibillion-dollar question is who is exempt and who gets
paid. When the Fair Labor Standards Act was first written, while
FDR was president, it was fairly clear who was a worker and who
was a manager, and who was a professional and who wasn't.
</P>
<P>
But as the economy has moved from manufacturing toward services,
professionals do not necessarily manage anymore, and even low-
level workers often need technical expertise, making the
categories murkier.
</P>
<P>
In 2003, the Bush administration set out to "clarify" the law,
revising income-level tests in various job categories (above
them, you are a salaried manager and don't get overtime; below
them, you are not a manager and you do) and specifying that more
than half a manager's time actually has to be spent managing. But
greater clarity was not necessarily a result.
</P>
<P>
"All that's clear is that it clearly didn't work," said Robert
Fox, the deputy director of Working America, founded four years
ago by the AFL-CIO to address the needs of working families who
do not belong to unions.
</P>
<P>
The most common question posted on the "Ask a Lawyer" section of
the group's Web site, Fox said, is about overtime: "Who's
eligible? Who's exempt? What counts toward overtime?"
</P>
<P>
Let's take those one at a time. The "who's eligible, who's
exempt?" question is one increasingly heard in a courtroom.
Lawsuits brought under the Fair Labor Standards Act, by employees
claiming they had been illegally declared ineligible and
demanding back overtime pay, have increased by 50 percent since
the changes were made, mostly in the form of large class-action
suits.
</P>
<P>
Which leads to the question of "what counts toward overtime?" It
used to be, for instance, that to do personal errands (go to the
bank, shop, pick up groceries), you had to leave the office at
lunch. Now you can do all that while sitting at your desk. So if
you are spooning your yogurt and ordering from Amazon, you are on
your lunch break, right? But what if you get an IM from the boss?
Or an e-mail message from a client? And you respond? Are you
working again?
</P>
<P>
"That counts as working time," said Mark Thierman, a plaintiffs'
lawyer in Reno, Nev., "particularly if you don't feel you can
turn around and say 'I'm on my lunch break and I'll get to it
later.' If you have to jump on every e-mail that you get then
you're on call, and that isn't a lunch break."
</P>
<P>
What if that same message comes over a BlackBerry or cell phone
when you are technically off the clock? "BlackBerry time is work
time," said Dan McCoy, a partner in the employment practices
group of Fenwick &amp;amp; West, a law firm. "It absolutely
counts."
</P>
<P>
The law has long and consistently excluded commuting from hours
worked.
</P>
<P>
But as commutes grow longer, and workers use time on the train
(and, heaven help us, in the car) to tap on their laptop or
BlackBerry, the exceptions are starting to define the rule. And
while the people most likely to be working while commuting are
exempt-category workers like managers, experts say, the need to
bring the office onto the bus is creeping into the lives of
workers qualified for overtime, too.
</P>
<P>
Robin Bond, founder of Transition Strategies, an employment law
firm in Wayne, Pa., said: "If a nonexempt employee gets in his
car and immediately gets on a conference call where his
participation is required, or not stopped by management, that is
work time."
</P>
<P>
So if so many of us qualify for overtime, and there are so many
opportunities for overtime, why aren't more of us getting more
extra pay?
</P>
<P>
There are several reasons, all of which reveal much about the new
realities of work.
</P>
<P>
First is the practical fact that time worked outside of work is
hard to track. Of course, there are electronic records of work
calls, and e-mail trails are time/date stamped, but the five
minutes here, 15 minutes there don't often rise to the level of
logged work time.
</P>
<P>
"It is daunting to keep an accurate record," said John Thompson,
a partner in the Atlanta office of Fisher &amp;amp; Phillips, a
labor and employment firm. "In a wireless world, nobody actually
knows what the employee does or when he or she does it."
</P>
<P>
Put another way, many workers themselves can't even separate when
they are working from when they are not.
</P>
<P>
A second reason is the prevalence of an office culture that says
overwork is rewarded with bragging rights, not money. It is
illegal for a boss to send a message, directly or obliquely, that
filing for overtime will be frowned upon, but it happens.
</P>
<P>
It is unclear exactly what took place with Bird and Harpo,
because she did not return phone calls, but her co-workers were
quoted in The New York Post as suggesting that only because she
was a favorite could she get away with filing for so much
overtime.
</P>
<P>
Finally, experts say, there is the status factor.
</P>
<P>
Plaintiffs' lawyers have stopped being surprised by the fact that
workers wrongly classified as "exempt" are reluctant to change
their job title, because being a salaried manager, even at a loss
of income, carries the intangible benefit of respect.
</P>
<P>
Thierman, the lawyer from Reno, tells of a suit he brought and
won against a brokerage firm, proving that employees were
entitled to overtime. The company paid a substantial settlement,
"then went back to doing things the old way," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I asked their lawyer 'Don't they know we're just going to sue
them again?"' Thierman recalled. He said the opponent answered,
"They don't think they can go onto college campuses and tell
people 'We pay hourly."'
