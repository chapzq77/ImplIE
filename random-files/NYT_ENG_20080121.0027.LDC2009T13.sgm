ECHOES OF DR. KING IN FINANCE, POLITICS AND THE DAILY GRIND
</HEADLINE>

NEW YORK
</P>
<P>
The leader of one of America's most venerable civil rights groups
kicked off his annual celebration of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther
King Jr. in what might have once seemed an unlikely fashion: by
ringing the opening bell Friday morning at the Nasdaq stock
exchange.
</P>
<P>
Roy Innis, the national chairman of the Congress of Racial
Equality, clapped and cheered beside Dennis Bassford, the chief
executive of Moneytree Inc., a chain of check-cashing stores, as
the towering video screen outside Nasdaq's media center beamed
the scene onto Times Square.
</P>
<P>
At its dinner on Monday night in honor of King's birthday, the
civil rights group plans to salute Bassford for providing access
to credit for poor communities and spreading financial literacy.
Niger Innis, the group's national spokesman and Roy Innis' son,
explained, "You want to have leverage in our society, the color
is not black or white -- it's green."
</P>
<P>
As the federal holiday approached, many New Yorkers, from
Caribbean business leaders to labor organizers taking aim at
Starbucks, found a resonance in King's birthday that was almost
post-racial. They talked about empowering the poor and the
working class, and about identities more complex than just black
and white.
</P>
<P>
Strikingly often in those discussions, they mentioned a name that
they said had brought fresh meaning to the holiday: that of Sen.
Barack Obama, the first black candidate widely seen as having a
shot at the presidency.
</P>
<P>
"Barack's campaign -- like him or not, support his policies or
his politics or not -- the brilliance of this black man winning
in Iowa and nearly winning in New Hampshire is a huge victory for
Dr. King's dream," Niger Innis said. "It doesn't mean that the
fight is over, but the battlefield certainly has changed."
</P>
<P>
To some, Obama's candidacy recalls the way King expanded his
focus to include economic and foreign policy issues shortly
before he was assassinated 40 years ago in Memphis, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
"Dr. King had become very unpopular before his death, talking
about things that black men did not have the right to talk
about," George Hulse, aboard member of the Caribbean American
Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said over bagels Friday at the
chamber's King breakfast.
</P>
<P>
"They could not talk about economic issues. They could not talk
about international affairs. They could not talk about world
issues," said Hulse, vice president of external affairs for
Healthfirst, an HMO.
</P>
<P>
Many of the people who had Obama on their minds as King's
birthday celebration approached emphasized that they had not
decided whether to vote for him. His main opponent, Sen. Hillary
Rodham Clinton, also enjoys support among civil rights leaders
and blacks. And many of the organizations that commemorate the
holiday are nonprofit groups that by law cannot endorse
candidates.
</P>
<P>
Rather, Obama's name came up alongside King's as people declared
that the civil rights leader was no longer a symbol only for
blacks, or as they expressed hope that the two senators would
resist temptations to focus the campaign on race and gender.
</P>
<P>
Roy Innis said he was glad they seemed to have pulled back from a
dust-up over Clinton's remark that King's work came to fruition
after President Lyndon B. Johnson pushed through the Civil Rights
Act of 1964.
</P>
<P>
"It's so funny when someone tells the truth and they have to
apologize for it," he said of Clinton. "LBJ knew the redneck
opposition and busted their kneecaps and broke their arms. So it
was a collaboration between King and the civil rights movement
and LBJ."
</P>
<P>
Debra Lesane, who is helping the Caribbean business group plan
seminars on banking and credit, said at the breakfast that if
King were alive today, he would be deploring the subprime
mortgage crisis, which has disproportionately affected minority
homeowners.
</P>
<P>
Paraphrasing King, Bassford, the Moneytree executive, agreed.
"It's not good enough to have all the rights to engage in all the
areas of commerce, if you don't have the ability," he said at the
Nasdaq ceremony. "What good is it to be able to sit at the lunch
counter if you don't have the money to buy a hamburger?"
</P>
<P>
Economic issues also were at the forefront for people who felt
disconnected from the holiday.
</P>
<P>
The Industrial Workers of the World has chosen the King holiday
to protest against Starbucks for not providing holiday pay to its
workers on that date. But some baristas said they had never heard
of the campaign by the union, which is fighting to organize them.
"It's just a day like any other, like all holidays," said
Fernando Heredia, 22, who often works holidays at the Starbucks
at Eighth Avenue and 43rd Street.
</P>
<P>
Just outside the Nasdaq ceremony, Jordan Ramos, 19, on a
cigarette break in Times Square, said that he would not get the
holiday off from his media services job, and that King loomed
larger for his Puerto Rican grandmother, who lived through the
civil rights struggle.
</P>
<P>
But he said he had come to connect King's message to issues of
more immediacy for him, like immigrants' rights. "It's not just
about African-Americans but about all minorities, how we're all
treated," he said.
</P>
<P>
Nearby, Idris, 35, an immigrant from Ghana who declined to give
his last name, said he could not take the holiday off because he
is paid on commission for selling tour bus packages to passers-
by. He said that he felt excluded in the United States, and that
King's message held little reassurance.
</P>
<P>
"It's an American thing to me," he said.
