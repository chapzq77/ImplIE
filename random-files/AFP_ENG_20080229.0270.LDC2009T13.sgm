Dexia reports 7.9-pct profit fall, sees opportunity in credit
crisis

<P>
The French-Belgian bank Dexia, which specialises in financing
local authorities, reported a 7.9-percent fall in net profit on
Friday but said it had been little affected by the US home-loan
subprime crisis.
</P>
<P>
Dexia, saying it could benefit from new conditions on troubled
markets, reported a net profit of 2.533 billion euros (3.85
billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
This was more than the figure of 2.296 billion euros expected by
analysts polled by Thomson Financial.
</P>
<P>
Chief executive Axel Miller said: "The financial crisis has
created a new environment from which only banks with an optimal
level of liquidity, asset quality and capital will be able to
draw benefit.
</P>
<P>
"In view of these results and events in 2007, Dexia is showing
that it is one of these banks."
</P>
<P>
Dexia forecast average annual dividend growth of 10.0 percent and
said it was recommending a 12.3-percent rise in the dividend for
2007 to 91 cents per share.
</P>
<P>
Sales fell by 1.6 percent to 6.896 billion euros, which was
slightly more than forecast by analysts.
</P>
<P>
But in the fourth quarter of the year, net profit fell by 25.3
percent to 587 million euros and sales by 10.0 percent to 1.695
billion euros.
</P>
<P>
Dexia said that the results demonstrated its financial strength
and said: "The subprime mortgage crisis (in the United States)
and in the financial sector has not had a significant impact on
the quality of the group's assets."
</P>
<P>
It added that it had steered clear of the collateralised debt
market at the root of the subprime crisis and that "the credit
risk arising from subprime mortgage loans does not particularly
worry Dexia."
</P>
<P>
Many banks have had to write off billions of dollars from their
assets because they were exposed through securitised debt to a
collapse of the US subprime market.
</P>
<P>
However, Dexia said that some of its assets had lost value in
connection with its subsidiary FSA involved in underwriting debt,
and that its treasury activities and activity on financial
markets had also had some setbacks.
</P>
<P>
For these asset reductions it gave a figure of 75 million euros
in the fourth quarter, but said that this was a purely book-
keeping figure because the assets remained fundamentally sound
and would recover.
</P>
<P>
Financial Security Assurance (FSA) had also announced on February
22 that it had written down its portfolio of assets by 418
million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Dexia said that further writedowns might become necessary for the
first quarter of this year.
