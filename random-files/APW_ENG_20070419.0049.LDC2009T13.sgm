Please sir, can we have some more? Dickens World theme park
recalls a bygone age

CHATHAM, England 2007-04-19 00:22:05 UTC

<P>
In Dickens World, rat-catchers hunt vermin on London's cobbled
streets, pickpockets roam the alleys -- and visitors line up for
a fun-tastic water ride.
</P>
<P>
A new theme park inspired by the work of 19th-century novelist
Charles Dickens aims to transform a 70,000 square foot (6,500
square meter) warehouse near London into a teeming -- and family-
friendly -- corner of Victorian England. Literary purists may
balk, but the attraction's backers are confident.
</P>
<P>
"Would Dickens approve? Yes," said Thelma Grove of the Dickens
Fellowship, a global association of the writer's fans. "He loved
to see people enjoy themselves, and he had a very sharp eye for
the latest fad."
</P>
<P>
In more than a dozen sprawling novels, from "The Pickwick Papers"
to "The Mystery of Edwin Drood," Dickens created a rich tapestry
of 19th-century England, peopled by struggling workers, aspiring
clerks, jaded lawyers, ambitious orphans, rogues, runaways and
thieves. Still in print after more than a century, the books have
inspired numerous film and television adaptations and a popular
musical, "Oliver!"
</P>
<P>
Dickens World's backers say they are trying to capture that
vibrant landscape in their 62 million pound (US$125 million;
euro92 million) theme park. They insist it is "based on a
credible and factual account of Charles Dickens' works and the
world in which he lived."
</P>
<P>
"You can't Disney-fy Dickens," said managing director Kevin
Christie, "because he was better and he was first."
</P>
<P>
The indoor attraction includes a central square of cobbled
streets and crooked buildings, where staff dressed as pickpockets
and serving wenches will mingle with the crowds. Visitors who pay
the 12.50 pounds (US$25; euro18) admission charge -- 7.50 pounds
(US$15; euro11) for children -- will have the chance to see the
Ghost of Christmas Past in Ebeneezer Scrooge's haunted house, be
hectored by a schoolmaster at Dotheboys Hall -- the dismal school
from "Nicholas Nickleby" -- and peer into the fetid cells of
notorious Newgate Prison.
</P>
<P>
Tourists can also have a meal in the cafeteria, which has
resisted the temptation to offer "Please, sir can I have some
more?" 2-for-1 specials. The little ones can play in Fagin's Den,
an area for preschoolers named -- alarmingly, some might think --
after the gangmaster of the band of thieves in "Oliver Twist."
</P>
<P>
There may be a whiff of kitsch in the air at Dickens World, but
its supporters include some serious Dickens buffs.
</P>
<P>
"It's like a dream come true," said Grove, who acted as an
adviser on the project. She helped ensure that everything from
the names on the faux shopfronts to the pharmacy offering "syrup
of squirrels" was true to the Victorian period.
</P>
<P>
"People who don't know their Dickens won't know whether they are
authentic or not," she said. "But I want to be above criticism."
</P>
<P>
At the moment, Dickens World is a work in progress. A planned
opening this week was postponed at the last minute until May 25
due to a glitch with the "4D animatronic theater show" about
Dickens' life and work.
</P>
<P>
As journalists toured the site Wednesday, hard-hatted
construction workers unfurled a banner featuring a Victorian
skyline across the front of the hangar-like building in Chatham,
35 miles (56 kilometers) southeast of London.
</P>
<P>
Promotional literature for Dickens World promises the "sounds and
smells" of the 19th century. For now it sounds like a
construction site and smells of sawdust and fresh paint.
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be a few weeks, but you can see we're getting
there," Christie said.
</P>
<P>
One aspect of the attraction is inarguably authentic -- Dickens'
links with this corner of southeast England run deep. The writer
spent several years of his childhood in Chatham, where his father
worked as a clerk at the Royal Navy dockyards, and he returned to
the region late in life. The nearby marshland was memorably
evoked in "Great Expectations."
</P>
<P>
Chatham's docks are long closed, and Dickens World -- sandwiched
between an outlet mall and a multiplex cinema -- is part of the
region's attempt at redevelopment.
</P>
<P>
Management and staff alike are embracing the project with
enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
"It's a living experience where you can go back in time," said
Eddie Sampson, who plays rat-catcher and "gentle rogue" Ned
Fiendish, one of several characters who wander the streets of
Dickens World adding Victorian color and dispensing directions to
visitors.
</P>
<P>
Sampson has taken to his work with gusto, creating an elaborate
biography for his character. He says Ned never knew his father,
fought at the battle of Waterloo, supplements rat-catching with a
bit of housebreaking but has a good heart.
</P>
<P>
"I invented the entire story," Sampson said with pride.
</P>
<P>
Managers hope the staff's enthusiasm will rub off on
visitors.They want Dickens to be thought of as fun.
</P>
<P>
Asked for the park's mission statement, Grove quotes the
admirable Mr. Sleary from Dickens' "Hard Times": "People must be
amused, squire, somehow. They can't be always a-working, nor yet
they can't be always a-learning."
