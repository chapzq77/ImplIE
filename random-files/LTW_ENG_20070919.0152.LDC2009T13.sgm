`Religious Enlightenment' Part of Detainee Reeducation Effort
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The U.S. military has introduced "religious enlightenment" and
other education programs for Iraqi detainees, some of whom are as
young as 11, Marine Maj. Gen. Douglas Stone, the commander of
U.S. detention facilities in Iraq, said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Stone said such efforts, aimed mainly at Iraqis who have been
held for more than a year, are intended to "bend them back to our
will" and are part of waging war in what he called "the
battlefield of the mind." Most of the younger detainees are held
in a facility that the military calls the "House of Wisdom."
</P>
<P>
The religious courses are led by Muslim clerics who "teach out of
a moderate doctrine," Stone said, according to the transcript of
a conference call he held from Baghdad with a group of defense
bloggers. Such schooling "tears apart" the arguments of al-Qaida,
such as "Let's kill innocents" and helps to "bring some of the
edge off" the detainees, he said.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the increased U.S. troop presence in Iraq this
year, the number of Iraqis in U.S. detention has swelled from
about 10,000 last year to more than 25,000. The effort to reshape
attitudes among the growing detainee population is aimed at
addressing a problem that has vexed U.S. troops in Iraq for the
past four years: Military detention facilities have served as
breeding grounds for extremist views, transforming some prisoners
into hard-core insurgents, according to military analysts.
</P>
<P>
Stone said he wants to identify "irreconcilables" -- those
detainees whose views cannot be moderated -- and "put them away"
in permanent detention facilities. Psychiatrists, psychologists,
counselors and interrogators help distinguish the extremists from
others, he said.
</P>
<P>
After reassessments and interrogations, Stone said, some
detainees are recommended for release. "If a detainee is an
imperative security risk ... then I'm going to reduce that risk
and I'm going to replace that destructive ideology," he said.
"And then when he's assessed to no longer be a threat, I'm going
to release the detainee being less likely to be a recidivist."
</P>
<P>
Since May, Stone said, he has released about 2,000 detainees "and
we've not had any coming back." He said his goal is to keep those
who are released from harming U.S. troops or anyone else.
"They're not going out of here unless I can feel comfortable
about that," Stone added. "I'm not doing mass releases."
</P>
<P>
Other initiatives at the facilities include vocational training
and basic education programs for about 7,000 detainees. Stone
said he believes his approach is "compelling because it's how you
win this war, not only the one in Iraq, but the one on a greater
basis." He quoted Iraqi Vice President Tariq al-Hashimi as saying
that "America could win the war if they just applied the exact
process that you're putting in detention to the rest of the
entire nation," in Stone's words.
</P>
<P>
The 25,000 detainees now being held in U.S. facilities in Iraq
include more than 820 juveniles, Stone said, most of whom are
held in the House of Wisdom, which opened last month and is
located at the Camp Victory military base near Baghdad's airport.
He said that six additional young people had been sent to him
just Tuesday, and that "the trend is towards the youth,"
including 11-, 12- and 13-year-olds. He described older juveniles
-- the 15-, 16- and 17-year-olds -- as "harder nuts" and said
that 50 to 60 of them have been removed from U.S. detention
facilities and turned over to Iraqi authorities for trial.
</P>
<P>
Stone said that youths grow up to become insurgents by starting
out as messengers, guards and even planters of makeshift bombs.
He said his staff members include a specialist in Islamic youth
programs and he has also put together "a positive program that
has been proven in Islam to actually turn the kids around to sort
of reject some of these other things." Stone, who speaks Arabic
and said he reads the Koran daily, noted that his facilities have
30 classrooms staffed with teachers and counselors. He has also
started "four very large soccer programs" aimed at young
detainees.
</P>
<P>
The new religious training, Stone said, helps U.S. forces
pinpoint the hard-core extremists. "I want to know who they are,"
he said. "They're like rotten eggs, you know, hiding in the
Easter basket."
</P>
<P>
Stone said his staff conducts polygraph tests for detainees who
promise to change after undergoing the religious training
program. "We were trying to figure out if they're messing with
us. ... You're not talking about radicals going to choirboys."
But he also added that they're succeeding in countering
extremists in the facilities. "We're busting them down, we're
making whole moderate compounds that didn't exist before."
</P>
<P>
Stone described a sort of religious insurgency that occurred at
one detention facility on Sept. 2. "We had a compound of
moderates for the first time overtake ... extremists. It's never
happened before. Found them, identified them, threw them up
against the fence and shaved their frickin' beards off of them.
... I mean, that is historic."
</P>
<P>
Jack Holt, the spokesman for the Pentagon's new media operations,
said that 60 people were invited to join the Stone interview
Tuesday but that only four bloggers did so. Of those four, at
least two appear to be active-duty military, but as of Tuesday
evening none so had discussed Stone's presentation online.
</P>
<P>
Other elements of Stone's program are being developed. He said he
has created a "transition-out barracks" where detainees being
released discuss civics and human rights. He has also begun a
"huge, expensive" Rand Corp. research study on detainee
motivation and morale and has plans for a major communication
campaign.
</P>
<P>
He said he also wants to provide jobs for released detainees.
"I'm not naive," Stone said. "If they don't have any income,
they're going to go back" to the insurgency.
