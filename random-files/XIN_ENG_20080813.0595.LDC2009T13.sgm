QINHUANGDAO, East China, Aug. 13 (Xinhua)
</P>
<P>
Brazilian men's soccer team defeated host China 3-0 in their last
group match in the Olympic tournament here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Brazil thus advanced to the finals with an unbeaten record from
Group C, and would take on Cameroon in their quarterfinal match.
</P>
<P>
The loss of China was the fourth consecutive time that the
Olympic host countries failed to progress to the knockout stage.
</P>
<P>
Brazil's first goal came in the 18th minute into the match. Alves
Diego ran after a through pass by Ronaldinho, and avoided Chinese
goalkeeper Liu Zhenli on their one-on-one encounter before he
coolly sent the ball into the empty net.
</P>
<P>
In the 68th minute, Han Peng, a usual striker but played a
defensive position in today's match, received a yellow card after
pulling down Brazil's striker Sobis Rafael.
</P>
<P>
Brazil's Neves Thiago then extended their lead in the awarded
free kick with his left-foot shot. The goalkeeper Liu didn't make
any response to the shot.
</P>
<P>
In the 73rd minute, Thiago again enlarged the victory with a
left-foot low shot from outside the penalty box.
</P>
<P>
"China should have played more aggressively in front of their
home crowds," Brazilian head coach, Dunga, said at the post-match
press conference. He was a key defensive midfielder for the
Brazilian squad that won the 1994 World Cup.
</P>
<P>
The only threat from the Chinese side came in the 37th minute in
the first half, when Jiang Ning dodged Brazil's defenders and
struck from the left side of the penalty box, but his effort was
warded off by defender Silva Thiago's outstretched right foot.
</P>
<P>
"This is not a normal match for us, as three of our four
defenders were suspended due to yellow-card accumulations and
red-card suspensions," Chinese head coach Yin Tiesheng said.
</P>
<P>
"Indeed our players are far behind the Brazilians in terms of
techniques, tactics as well as physical abilities. We just wanted
to give them more punches and pressures, and I believe we already
did it," he said.
</P>
<P>
"If we could finish our shots better, we could have threatened
their goalmouth," he said.
</P>
<P>
After three group matches, China got only 1 point and stood at
the bottom in the group.
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to make any excuses for our loss," Chinese captain
Li Weifeng said. "This is the end of our Olympic tournament, but
this is not the end of our football."
</P>
<P>
"I hope we could give more tolerances and time to Chinese
football, so that our younger players would play better in the
future," he said.
