Italian party urges review of EU borders pact: report
</HEADLINE>

The head of Italy's anti-immigration Northern League, flush from
a strong showing in elections two weeks ago, on Wednesday urged a
review of the Schengen treaty allowing free circulation in 22 EU
member states."There are things to negotiate," Umberto Bossi told
lawmakers, according to the ANSA news agency. "We should review
Schengen because we cannot go on like this," he added, without
elaborating.
</P>
<P>
EU members can travel freely in the Schengen zone, which includes
22 of the bloc's 27 member states.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, another Northern League stalwart, former reforms
minister Roberto Calderoli, said "allowing free circulation to
new members like Romania was a mistake."
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the weekly Gente, Calderoli said: "The
Schengen treaty was for European countries that were socio-
economically homogeneous, which the new members are not.
Inevitably, the poorest sections of these populations spread
west, increasing petty crime."
</P>
<P>
The mid-April elections marked a breakthrough for the Northern
League, which nearly doubled its strength in parliament with more
than eight percent of the vote, prompting fears that the small
anti-immigration party would unduly influence prime minister-
elect Silvio Berlusconi's agenda.
</P>
<P>
The day after the elections, Berlusconi vowed to crack down on
illegal immigrants, saying those involved in crime were part of
an "army of evil."
</P>
<P>
Berlusconi, elected with a solid margin, vowed to cooperate with
Italy's neighbours in "deporting non-EU citizens who are here and
do not have work or home and are forced into crime in order to
live."
</P>
<P>
The incoming interior minister, Northern League member Roberto
Maroni, said after the vote that he wants to beef up policing and
step up "cleansing" of illegal immigrants.
</P>
<P>
"We need more cleansing and more police," he told the leading
daily Corriere della Sera, linking crime to "immigration, often
clandestine."
</P>
<P>
Maroni also hinted that specific steps would be taken against
Romanian citizens.
