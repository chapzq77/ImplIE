Iraqi troops, Sadrists in Basra standoff by Karim Jamil
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Iraqi troops were in a tense standoff with radical Shiite cleric
Moqtada al- Sadr's supporters on Friday after they surrounded an
office block occupied by the group in the southern city of
Basra.The move was blasted by Sadr's supporters as a
"provocation" but the Iraqi government said the operation only
aimed to recover offices unfairly occupied by political groups.
</P>
<P>
The incident comes only weeks after bloody fighting broke out on
March 25 between Iraqi forces and Sadr's Mahdi Army militia when
Prime Minister Nuri al- Maliki launched a crackdown on Shiite
militiamen in the port city.
</P>
<P>
The clashes spread to other Shiite regions of Iraq, killing and
wounding hundreds of people.
</P>
<P>
"The police and the army have laid siege to Sadr's office in
Basra," office head Sheikh Harith al-Athari told AFP. "They have
also stopped people from attending Friday prayers.
</P>
<P>
"The forces, backed by armoured vehicles, have asked us to leave
the building," he added.
</P>
<P>
Journalists reported Sadr supporters had refused to leave the
office block in the oil city, which lies about 550 kilometres
(340 miles) south of the capital.
</P>
<P>
Interior ministry spokesman General Abdel Karim Khalaf told AFP
the operation had been approved by Maliki and aimed to "recover
official buildings that were being occupied."
</P>
<P>
Salah al-Obeidi, a Sadr spokesman from the holy city of Najaf, in
central Iraq, said "it is a provocation that will induce people
to resort to force.
</P>
<P>
"The objective of the security forces is to further aggravate
tensions and it shows the government's claims that it is not
targeting Sadr supporters to be false," he added.
</P>
<P>
Lawmakers from the Sadr political bloc lashed out at Maliki and
his government, saying the cleric's movement was a target of a
sustained campaign.
</P>
<P>
"These are not security operations. There is a hidden political
agenda," said Falah Shanshal.
</P>
<P>
"It is a move to isolate the Sadr movement from the country's
political process ahead of the elections. They want to weaken the
Sadr movement. But the Sadr movement is a belief. It is a
national movement."
</P>
<P>
In October, Iraq will hold elections in all 18 provinces.
</P>
<P>
Shanshal said the recent strategies "under the pretext of
implementing law" were actually sowing the seeds of hatred.
</P>
<P>
"You (the government) are destroying relations between the people
and the government. You are creating hatred and negative
feelings," Shanshal told AFP during a visit to Sadr City on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Sadr City has been a site of violent clashes between Shiite
militiamen, mostly from Sadr's Mahdi Army militia, and Iraqi and
US forces, since March 25 when Maliki ordered a crackdown in
Basra.
</P>
<P>
Salah al-Ugaili, another Sadrist MP, said 398 people have been
killed in the clashes and 1,331 wounded since March 25 in the
sprawling impoverished district of eastern Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
The figures were not independently confirmed. Doctor Wiyam
Rashhad, head of Al- Sadr hospital in Sadr City told AFP his
facility had registered 135 people killed in the clashes and
another 800 wounded.
</P>
<P>
There are two other hospitals in Sadr City.
</P>
<P>
Shanshal, however, said the Sadr movement will face this
"challenge and participate strongly in the elections."
</P>
<P>
"There are militias in the government. They are working to kill
the movement. But we will strongly face them."
