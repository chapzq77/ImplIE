Australia's ANZ poaches HSBC regional chief to help Asian push
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Australia's third largest bank ANZ announced Tuesday that HSBC
regional chief Mike Smith would take over its top job from
October 1, in a move expected to consolidate the bank's push into
Asia.
</P>
<P>
Australia and New Zealand (ANZ) Banking Group chairman Charles
Goode said Smith, 50, would succeed John McFarlane as the bank's
chief executive.
</P>
<P>
Goode said ANZ undertook a global search before selecting Smith,
who is currently chief executive and president of the Hong Kong
and Shanghai Banking Corporation (HSBC) in Hong Kong, chairman of
the Hang Seng and HSBC Malaysia banks, as well as global head of
commercial banking for the giant HSBC.
</P>
<P>
"Michael is well qualified to take ANZ forward in its next stage
of development," Goode said in a statement to the Australian
Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
"He brings ANZ considerable experience of the Asian marketplace
and a strong commercial banking background," Goode added.
</P>
<P>
Smith is expected to continue a push into Asia that began during
McFarlane's 10 years in charge of ANZ.
</P>
<P>
ANZ last year bought a 19.9 percent stake in Shanghai Rural
Commercial Bank (SRCB), China's biggest rural commercial lender,
and 20 percent of the Tianjin City Commercial Bank, also in
China.
</P>
<P>
It also has a credit card joint venture in Vietnam with the
country's largest privately-owned commercial bank, Sacombank, as
well as investments in Indonesia, the Philippines and Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
The bank said last year that it wanted to export staff and
technology to Asia where there are more growth opportunities than
in the mature Australian market.
