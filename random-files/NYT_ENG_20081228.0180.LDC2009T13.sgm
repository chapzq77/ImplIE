DISAPPOINTED ON TWO FRONTS
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With strong safety Jermaine Phillips out with a broken arm, Sabby
Piscitelli has been under increased scrutiny lately. And the
second-year player from Oregon State responded Sunday with a
memorable interception.
</P>
<P>
The Bucs led 17-14 early in the fourth, but the Raiders had it
first and 10 at the Bucs 26. Moments earlier, a face mask against
Gaines Adams wiped out Phillip Buchanon's interception.
</P>
<P>
But on his next pass, JaMarcus Russell threw deep to the right
toward tight end Zach Miller. The ball was off the mark  and
Piscitelli was off to the races. The 6-foot-3, 223-pounder from
Boca Raton dashed up the left sideline, weaved across the field,
shaking off a few tackles, followed a crushing block by Tanard
Jackson and was finally dragged down by Russell at the Oakland 11
for an 84-yard return.
</P>
<P>
It was Piscitelli's second career interception (both this
season), and it set up Cadillac Williams' 8-yard touchdown run
that put the Bucs up 24-14 with 11:27 left.
</P>
<P>
Piscitelli, 25, talked about the return and the disappointment of
the season-ending 31-24 defeat.
</P>
<P>
Describe the play.
</P>
<P>
JaMarcus tried to look me off, and I just got a good break on it.
It was a good rush and made him (overthrow it). I tried to play
the ball and do what I could with it. I'm kind of disappointed I
didn't score, but that's a long run.
</P>
<P>
What was going through your head as you were nearing the end
zone?
</P>
<P>
I was trying to score. I cut back and broke a tackle or two, but
your body almost shuts off at that point. I even tried to stop
and let JaMarcus run by me. But my legs were just (shot). I just
wanted to get all the yards I could at that second.
</P>
<P>
Did you see the block that Jackson threw for you?
</P>
<P>
Actually, when I cut off that (block), that's when my body
starting shutting down. I'm just glad the offense scored, and it
kind of bailed us out of that situation.
</P>
<P>
What has happened to this team in the fourth quarter?
</P>
<P>
No excuses. You go to the film, and the most important thing is
you have to finish. I think we did play well on defense. But we
have to go to the film and see what our mistakes were. It's a
four-quarter game, and I'm disappointed I couldn't help the team
more.
</P>
<P>
How disappointing is it to have the season end this way?
</P>
<P>
It's rough. I know it's something that I take personally. And I'm
going to make sure it doesn't happen next year and improve my
game to make sure I don't contribute to any losses we have.
</P>
<P>
How important was it to you to make a statement personally?
</P>
<P>
That's what safeties and corners are there for  to make those big
plays and try to turn games around. I think the Bucs had that in
mind when they drafted me. That's something I have to work on. It
was good to help make a big play and to help us try to win this
game. The defensive line did a great job on that, so they get
most of the credit.
</P>
<P>
FAST FACTS
</P>
<P>
Going long but coming up short
</P>
<P>
Sabby Piscitelli's 84-yard interception return Sunday was the
third longest in Bucs history. But it is the only one among the
top five that didn't go for a touchdown:
