trade

Under pressure from global trade rivals, EU nations were expected
to push former colonies in Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific
regions on Tuesday to complete negotiations on new regional free
trade pacts by the end of 2007, deals which aid groups fear could
lead to more harm than good.
</P>
<P>
Over 55 trade development ministers from the European Union and
its former colonies are to debate how they will meet an end-of-
year World Trade Organization deadline to conclude the
controversial market-opening trade talks.
</P>
<P>
Regional "economic partnership" trade pacts with the 27-nation EU
are supposed to be concluded this year, but the talks have been
stalled for months due to market access, good governance and aid
levels.
</P>
<P>
Many of the 78-poor nation grouping known as the ACP group of
former European colonies are also loathe to give up over three
decades of dependency on privileged access to EU markets.
</P>
<P>
"The timeframe for the conclusion ... by the end of 2007 is
tight, but we should make use of it," said Germany's Development
Minister Heidemarie Wieczorek-Zeul, who is hosting the talks here
at an exclusive resort overlooking the Rhine River valley.
</P>
<P>
World Bank President Paul Wolfowitz and Asha-rose Migiro, the
U.N.'s deputy secretary-general were also attending the talks,
which were also focusing on how aid donors like the EU and U.N.
bodies can help reconstruction efforts in Congo.
</P>
<P>
The ministers and officials were to debate how to provide energy
to the poorest nations in Africa, while making sure the
electricity they use come from renewable sources.
</P>
<P>
Wolfowitz appealed to the EU ministers at informal dinner talks
Monday night that the trade pacts go hand in hand with
substantial aid to build up key infrastructure like roads and
electrical grids, which are critical for an economy to function.
</P>
<P>
"What they need right now is more financial assistance, there are
many other things as well but you can't build a private sector
without electricity and roads," Wolfowitz said.
</P>
<P>
The trade accords foresee gradual market openings in parallel
with EU funding for good governance and reforms in developing
nations so as to spur trade among them.
</P>
<P>
Aid groups however, have derided the negotiations saying the
deals threaten to undermine poverty reduction.
</P>
<P>
Klaus Schilder from aid group World Economy, Ecology and
Development, WEED, said the trade pacts on the table "go beyond
what is being negotiated" at world trade talks, and include such
areas like investment, services and other business sectors which
developing countries do not want to include in the talks.
</P>
<P>
Over the past month EU Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson and EU
Development Commissioner Louis Michel held talks with the six
regional groupings negotiating trade pacts with the EU. The EU is
conducting negotiations with the Caribbean; West Africa; East and
Southern Africa, Central Africa, Southern Africa and the Pacific
regional grouping.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission said all the talks concluded so far that
they need to create "the widest possible market access" to the
EU's vast market for ACP regions.
</P>
<P>
The ACP nations are mostly ex-European colonies. The EU has
promised them a doubling of aid to euro2 billion (US$2.6 billion)
by 2010. Half is to come from the EU budget, the other half from
the 25 EU governments.
