Researchers say a museum in central Japan has right whale fossils
that are at least 5 million years old, making them the oldest
fossilized remains of the animal in the world, officials said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Researchers working in Nagano prefecture (state) estimate the
fossilized skull bones and jaw of a right whale on display at the
Shinshushinmachi Fossil Museum to be 5 million to 6 million years
old, said museum curator Ken Narita.
</P>
<P>
The oldest right whale fossil previously found was a skeleton
that was uncovered in Italy that dates back about 4 million
years, Narita said.
</P>
<P>
"This was an amazing find, and to have found the oldest one of
this type makes it truly remarkable," he said.
</P>
<P>
The skeleton was first discovered in 1938, when residents found
the whale's spine and rib bones exposed on the ground. However,
the skeleton was left undisturbed because the country was then at
war, according to the museum's Web site.
</P>
<P>
Researchers finally returned to the site in 1967, but the exposed
parts of the skeleton had been scattered or lost. Only the skull
and upper jaw parts were left to be excavated, but it was not
until recently that the museum could afford to get the bones
dated, Narita said.
</P>
<P>
While of the right whale genus, the animal's species is believed
to have been different from those of other right whale fossils
found so far, he added.
</P>
<P>
Right whale skeletons have often been found in Europe, but the
Nagano fossils and their dating "raises the possibility that
right whales might have originated in the North Pacific," said
Toshiyuki Kimura, curator of the Gunma Museum of Natural History.
Kimura also took part in the fossil research.
</P>
<P>
Right whales are now designated an endangered species and banned
for hunting by the International Whaling Commission. The entire
North Atlantic right whale population is estimated at just 350,
according to a U.S. federal researcher.
</P>
<P>
Nagano is 180 kilometers (110 miles) northwest of Tokyo.
