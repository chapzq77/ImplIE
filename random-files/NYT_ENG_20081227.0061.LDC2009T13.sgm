BARGAIN-HUNTING, AND FEELING SHEEPISH ABOUT IT
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Book publishers and booksellers are full of foreboding -- even
more than usual for an industry that's been anticipating its
demise since the advent of television. The holiday season that
just ended is likely to have been one of the worst in decades.
Publishers have been cutting back and laying off. Houghton
Mifflin Harcourt announced that it wouldn't be acquiring any new
manuscripts, a move akin to a butcher shop proclaiming it had
stopped ordering fresh meat.
</P>
<P>
Bookstores, both new and secondhand, are faltering as well.
Olsson's, the leading independent chain in Washington, went
bankrupt and shut down in September. Robin's, which says it is
the oldest bookstore in Philadelphia, will close next month. The
once-mighty Borders chain is on the rocks. Powell's, the huge
store in Portland, Ore., said sales were so weak it was
encouraging its staff to take unpaid sabbaticals.
</P>
<P>
Don't blame this carnage on the recession or any of the usual
suspects, including increased competition for the reader's time
or diminished attention spans. What's undermining the book
industry is not the absence of casual readers but the changing
habits of devoted readers.
</P>
<P>
In other words, it's all the fault of people like myself, who
increasingly use the Internet both to buy books and later, after
their value to us is gone, sell them. This is not about Amazon
peddling new books at discounted prices, which has been a factor
in the book business for a decade, but about the rise of a
worldwide network of amateurs who sell books from their homes or,
if they're lazy like me, in partnership with an Internet dealer
who does all the work for a chunk of the proceeds.
</P>
<P>
They get their books from friends, yard sales, recycling centers,
their own shelves, castoffs (I just bought a book from a guy
whose online handle was Clif Is Emptying His Closet). Some list
them for as little as a penny, although most aim for at least a
buck. This growing market is achieving an aggregate mass that is
starting to prove problematic for publishers, new bookstores and
secondhand bookstores.
</P>
<P>
For readers and collectors, these resellers, as they are called,
offer a great service. Lost in the hand-wringing over the state
of the book industry is the fact that this is a golden age for
those in love with old-fashioned printed volumes: More books are
available for less effort and less money than ever before. A book
search engine like ViaLibri.net can knit together 20,000
booksellers around the world offering tens of millions of nearly
new, used or rare books.
</P>
<P>
One consequence has been to change the calculations traditionally
involved in buying a book: Given the price, do I really want to
read this? Now it's become both an economic and a moral issue.
How much do I want to pay, and where do I want that money to go?
To my local community via a bookstore? To the publisher? To the
author?
</P>
<P>
In theory, I want to support all of these fine folks. In
practice, I decide to save a buck.
</P>
<P>
Here's one example of how I casually wreak destruction. I was
reading "Sylvia," an account by the late short-story master
Leonard Michaels of his unstable first wife. Looking for material
about Michaels, I saw his friend Wendy Lesser had written a long
essay about him in a book published last year by Pantheon. I
could buy a new paperback edition of that book, "Room for Doubt,"
for $13.95 plus tax in a bookstore. But there were dozens of
copies from resellers available online for as little as 1 cent,
plus shipping.
</P>
<P>
A penny felt a little chintzy, even for me, so I bought a
hardcover copy for 25 cents from someone who called herself
Heather Blue, plus a few bucks for shipping. Neither my local
bookstore nor Pantheon -- whose parent, Random House, announced
this month it would cut costs by reducing five divisions to three
-- nor the author got a share. The book looked good as new.
</P>
<P>
Lesser is the publisher of The Threepenny Review, a literary
journal. She lives in Berkeley, Calif., where, as it happens,
there is no longer a large general interest bookstore. Cody's, in
its prime one of the country's great stores, closed its last
outlet in June. The Barnes &amp;amp; Noble store there also
recently closed.
</P>
<P>
Andy Ross, the former owner of Cody's, told me that buying books
online "was not morally dubious, but it is tragic. It has a lot
of unintended consequences for communities."
</P>
<P>
Ross said he realized that Cody's was doomed when he noticed that
in the last year he hadn't sold a single copy of that old-
reliable for undergraduates, Kant's "Critique of Pure Reason."
Students presumably were buying it online. Sales of classics and
other backlist titles used to be the financial engine of
publishers and bookstores as well, allowing them to take chances
on new authors. Clearly, that model is breaking. Simon &amp;amp;
Schuster, which laid off staffers this month, cited backlist
sales as a particularly troubled area.
</P>
<P>
Michael Barnard, who owns Rakestraw Books in Danville, Calif.,
not far from Berkeley, was more critical of me. He said that I
was taking Lesser's work while depriving her of an income, and
that I would regret my selfish actions when all the physical
stores were gone.
</P>
<P>
Lesser's editor, Dan Frank, said that the rise of resellers like
Heather Blue meant that there was no longer a set price for a
book at any one time. If you want it during those first few weeks
when it is new, you will pay a premium. If you can wait, it might
be only a pittance. "These cracks and fractures will only grow
bigger," he said.
</P>
<P>
Lesser herself was philosophical. "I am a pragmatist, not a thin-
skinned, delicate little writer who thinks everything needs to be
what it is in heaven," she said. Still, she sounded a little
taken aback at the going rate for her books. "Twenty-five cents?
That's all it was?"
</P>
<P>
At least this way, the writer said, she gained a reader if not an
income. If I had had to search for the book in a store, maybe I
would never have found it.
</P>
<P>
"With the Internet, nothing is ever lost," Lesser said. "That's
the good news, and that's the bad news."
</P>
<P>
And what of the woman who sold me the book? She told me via
e-mail that her real name was Heather Mash and that she worked as
a domestic violence case manager in a women's shelter not too far
from Berkeley. She didn't set out to subvert the publishing and
bookselling world, she said. Like most of us who sell online,
Mash began because she had too many books and wanted to raise
money to buy more. "I would rather sell a book for a penny and
let someone enjoy it than keep it collecting dust," she said.
</P>
<P>
No industry undermined by its greatest partisans will thrive
long. CD sales plunged after music could be downloaded.
Newspapers are hurting even as their readership is mushrooming
online. As the Heather Mashes proliferate, traditional bookstores
will continue to fade.
</P>
<P>
Secondhand outlets that don't sell online are already an
anachronism. Even the novelist Larry McMurtry, whose enormous
secondhand shop in Archer City, Texas, was probably the biggest
holdout against the Internet, has surrendered.
</P>
<P>
The first book he sold online was a signed copy of "84, Charing
Cross Road," the classic account of a woman in postwar New York
who bought her books from a London shop she never saw. Helene
Hanff's slim volume used to be cherished for its depiction of a
vanished era. Now it seems simply ahead of its time.
