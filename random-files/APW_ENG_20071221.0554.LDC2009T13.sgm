There are "major uncertainties" swirling around the economic
outlook for the euro zone in 2008, the president of the European
Central Bank said.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with EuroNews that aired Friday, Jean-Claude
Trichet said that the bank's governing council, which sets
interest rates for the 13-nation euro zone, are worried about the
risk of weaker growth.
</P>
<P>
"It is true there are major uncertainties with regard to the
economic situation," he said. "The council of governors of the
ECB feels that there is a greater risk of weaker growth, with it
going below around 2 percent." A transcript of the interview,
along with a video, was posted on the broadcaster's Web site.

<P>
Dominique Strauss-Kahn, head of the International Monetary Fund,
said in an interview with RTL radio on Friday that global growth
will be hit by the subprime crisis.
</P>
<P>
"France will be hit, like unfortunately all countries, by a lower
growth rate," making the government's forecast of a 2.25 percent
pace difficult to achieve, he said.
</P>
<P>
"It could be that the end of 2008 is a rebound moment if we see
after six months that all the accounts have been balanced and
confidence returns."
</P>
<P>
Trichet, asked why the bank has left its benchmark interest rate
unchanged at 4 percent since June, Trichet said the ECB has been
acting within its mission to control inflation.
</P>
<P>
"Our first mandate -- which the treaty requires of us and our
fellow citizens demand of us -- is to ensure medium-term price
stability is in line with our target, that is inflation of less
than 2 percent and around 2 percent," he said. "In terms of the
320 million people living in the euro zone we therefore make our
monetary policy decisions to ensure price stability. That is our
principal mandate."
</P>
<P>
Trichet also reiterated previous remarks that the bank would not
tolerate the excuse of higher energy and food prices as a reason
to increase wages, thus spurring inflation.
</P>
<P>
"Because then, we would have what we call second-round effects,
leading to inflation which would be long lasting, instead of
being temporary and related to higher costs for oil and raw
materials and we would be unable to comply with our mandate, to
ensure price stability, and we wouldn't be doing what our fellow
citizens expressly ask us to," Trichet said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, the bank said it would mop up as much as
euro150 billion (US$215.24 billion) in a move to drain liquidity
from the markets.
</P>
<P>
The bank also reaffirmed its intent to keep steering liquidity to
a more balanced condition so as to align short-term interest
rates with the refinancing minimum bid rate, which is 4 percent.
The move followed a similar operation on Thursday, that was also
for euro150 billion (US$215.24 billion).
