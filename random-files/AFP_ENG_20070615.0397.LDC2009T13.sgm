Barroso urges EU states to help Malta on immigration
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso said Friday he
recognised the "special difficulty" Malta faced from illegal
immigration and said member states must help it tackle the
problem.
</P>
<P>
"They must put the principle of solidarity into action by
providing help to Malta and other member states in managing the
influx of illegal immigrants," he told Malta's parliament.
</P>
<P>
The island EU nation, with a population of around 400,000, has
rescued some 7,000 people in waters off its coast in the last
five years, with scores picked up -- some clinging to tuna farm
cages, others dead -- in May alone.
</P>
<P>
Barroso heard pleas from Malta's government and opposition for EU
help with the problem, with Prime Minister Lawrence Gonzi saying
that "last summer more died crossing the Mediterranean than in
the Lebanon conflict."
</P>
<P>
The EU Commission president described these events as a "human
tragedy for desperate people who are ruthlessly and unforgiveably
exploited", and acknowledged the difficulties Malta faced.
</P>
<P>
Many people in the rest of Europe were "simply unaware that the
search and rescue area and jurisdiction of Malta is larger than
the land mass of the United Kingdom, clearly disproportionate to
its resources," he said.
</P>
<P>
Barroso said that the coordinated maritime patrols between member
states launched last month would become a permanent fixture from
next January to help patrol the 27-nation bloc's southern
borders.
</P>
<P>
"I set out today my intention that the European patrols network
which started operation last May should become from January 2008
a permanent tool available at the request of member states to
curb illegal immigration across the Mediterranean and along the
south-east Atlantic coasts," he said.
</P>
<P>
Migration would be a central theme of the EU-Africa summit later
this year, he added, and the EU Commission would draw up
practical guidelines for managing Europe's external border,
covering search and rescue operations.
</P>
<P>
"The commission cannot solve all the problems, not least
(because) we don't have boats or planes. But I recognise that
more should be done, especially by member states," Barroso said.
</P>
<P>
"Member states have planes, member states have boats, have
resources which they can put at the disposal of a member state
that has special difficulty. Some political resistance is yet to
be overcome."
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, the European Union expressed determination to
save the lives of African migrants trying to reach its shores but
struggled to find concrete ways to help Malta tackle the problem.
