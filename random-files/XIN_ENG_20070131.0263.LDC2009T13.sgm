BOUAKE, Cote d' Ivoire,  Jan. 31 (Xinhua)
</P>
<P>
Representatives from Cote d'Ivoire's President Laurent Gbagbo and
the rebels have met in the country's central city of Bouake in
the presence of a mediator from Burkina Faso, in an effort for
holding direct dialogues demanded by Gbagbo.
</P>
<P>
Desire Tagro, Gbagbo's special envoy, accompanied by Burkina
Faso's Security Minister Djibril Bassole on Tuesday, arrived in
Bouake, a stronghold of the rebel group New Forces (NF), with the
aim of establishing contacts with NF chief Gillaume Soro.
</P>
<P>
After a closed conference, Tagro assured the people of Cote
d'Ivoire of the availability of Gbagbo to lead the peace process.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Bassole said that Tagro's arrival in Bouake sent a
strong signal. "This meeting will help us in the search for
peace. Burkina Faso's President Blaise Compaore wishes that the
meetings could be intensified and that we may solve" the issue,
said he.
</P>
<P>
NF chief Soro expressed his delight at Gbagbo's commitment to
direct negotiations with the New Forces. According to him, a
taboo had been broken and his organization was committed to
working towards the realization of peace and reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
Last December, Gbagbo had called for "direct dialogues" with the
NF rebels who are in control of the north of the country since a
failed coup attempt in Sept. 2002, so as to revive the peace
process in the country.
