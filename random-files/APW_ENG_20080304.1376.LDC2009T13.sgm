Los Angeles judge makes Anna Nicole ' s toddler daughter her sole
heir

LOS ANGELES 2008-03-04 20:42:34 UTC

<P>
Anna Nicole Smith's daughter will inherit the former Playboy
model's estate, a judge ruled Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Eighteen-month-old Dannielynn Hope was named sole heir by
Superior Court Judge Mitchell Beckloff, who also set up a trust
in the girl's name.
</P>
<P>
Her father, Larry Birkhead, and Smith's executor, Harry K. Stern,
will be co-trustees.
</P>
<P>
Beckloff granted a petition filed by Stern, who wanted to clarify
Smith's intentions toward her daughter. Smith drafted a will in
2001 -- five years before the child was born -- that left her
estate to her then-only son, Daniel. However, it said the assets
in Daniel's trust should be shared equally if she had future
children.
</P>
<P>
Daniel was 20 when he died in 2006, three days after Dannielynn
was born.
</P>
<P>
"We and Mr. Stern always believed that Anna Nicole never intended
to disinherit her daughter," Stern's lawyer, Bruce S. Ross, said
after the hearing. "I'm pleased to say this chapter in the saga
is closed."
</P>
<P>
Dannielynn could inherit millions of dollars if the estate wins
an ongoing court fight over a will by Smith's wealthy second
husband, J. Howard Marshall, that left much of his fortune to the
model. His relatives have been fighting the will for years.
