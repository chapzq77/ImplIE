ANTIPATHY TOWARD OBAMA SEEN AS HELPING ARKANSAS LIMIT ADOPTION

Strong opposition to the candidacy of Barack Obama in Arkansas
may have helped conservatives pass a measure blocking the
adoption of children by unmarried couples.
</P>
<P>
The measure, which voters overwhelmingly approved Tuesday and
which prevents unmarried cohabitating couples from adopting or
fostering children, won strong support from conservatives, exit
polls found. The ban affects all unmarried couples but was
written with the intent of preventing gay couples from raising
children in Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
Unlike most states, Arkansas shifted to the right politically in
this election. Sen. John McCain won the state by 20 points
compared with President Bush's 9-point victory in 2004.
</P>
<P>
"I think white Arkansas Democrats felt cross-pressured in this
race," said Jay Barth, a political science professor at Hendrix
College. "They didn't want to vote for what they viewed as Bush's
third term, but they also couldn't bring themselves to vote for
Barack Obama. One response was just to bow out of voting, and
their absence probably helped this proposal succeed."
</P>
<P>
Many experts did not expect the measure to pass with Democrats
nationwide flooding the polls to support Obama for president.
Prominent politicians, including former President Bill Clinton
and Gov. Mike Beebe, a Democrat, publicly opposed the ban.
Critics ran television advertisements of foster children pleading
with voters not to make it harder for them to find families.
</P>
<P>
But conservatives mounted a grass-roots campaign, mainly through
church groups, that framed the state's case-by-case approach to
adoption requests as an affront to traditional family values.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that the best place for a child to grow up is in a
stable home with a married mother and father," said Jerry Cox,
president of Family Council Action Committee, which obtained
95,000 signatures to place the proposal on state ballots. "But we
also believe in blunting a gay agenda that we see at work in
other states with regard to marriage and adoption issues."
</P>
<P>
Exit polls found that the ban was primarily supported by
conservatives, supporters of Bush and evangelicals.
</P>
<P>
After the votes were tallied, adoption groups decried the new
policy as contrary to the well-being of children. Arkansas has
three times as many children who need homes as people willing to
adopt or foster them, said Brett Kincaid, the campaign director
for Arkansas Families First, a coalition of groups opposing the
ban. He said the ban would make adoptions less common.
</P>
<P>
Arkansas is not the first state with such a policy. Florida
prohibits adoption by applicants who identify themselves as gay,
Utah prevents unmarried cohabitated couples from adopting and
Mississippi specifically bans same-sex couples from adopting.
</P>
<P>
A survey in October by the University of Arkansas found 55
percent of voters in the state opposed to the ban. But
conservatives ratcheted up their lobbying before the election,
distributing 350,000 inserts for church bulletins, and the
measure passed with nearly 57 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
"I was very surprised that our margin of victory was as wide as
it was," Cox said. "Our campaign was primarily grass-roots. The
opposition was primarily a media campaign. They did everything
they should have done to win. But we won."
