GENERALS PROPOSE A TIMETABLE FOR IRAQ (EMBARGO: No electronic

<P>
A new military plan for troop withdrawals from Iraq that was
described in broad terms this week to President-elect Barack
Obama falls short of the 16-month timetable Obama outlined during
his election campaign, U.S. military officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The plan was proposed by the top American commanders responsible
for Iraq, Gen. David H. Petraeus and Gen. Ray Odierno, and it
represents their first recommendation on troop withdrawals under
an Obama presidency. While Obama has said he will seek advice
from his commanders, their resistance to a faster drawdown could
present the new president with a tough political choice between
overruling his generals or backing away from his goal.
</P>
<P>
The plan, completed last week, envisions withdrawing two more
brigades, or some 7,000 to 8,000 troops, from Iraq in the first
six months of 2009, the military officials said. But that would
leave 12 combat brigades in Iraq by June 2009, and while
declining to be more specific, the officials made clear that the
withdrawal of all combat forces under the generals'
recommendations would not come until some time after May 2010,
Obama's target.
</P>
<P>
Transition officials said the plan was described in only general
terms to Obama by Robert M. Gates, who is staying on as defense
secretary, and Adm. Mike Mullen, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs
of Staff, when Obama met for five and a half hours with his
national security team on Monday in Chicago. They said all
participants had sidestepped the details of how to reconcile
Obama's timetable for withdrawing combat forces with the more
extended one recommended by the generals. A transition official
said that in future meetings, "the military will get a chance to
articulate their preferences."
</P>
<P>
In the campaign, Obama said he would not hesitate to overrule his
commanders. By early December, however, he signaled some
flexibility when he said that he still wanted combat troops out
of Iraq in 16 months but that he would also listen to the
recommendations of his generals. Gates has expressed confidence
that he and Obama might reach common ground. But in discussing
the new plan, senior military officials nonetheless made clear
that they were not comfortable with the time frame Obama
articulated in the campaign. "Sixteen months is going to be
tough," said one senior military officer who was briefed on the
plan. "We are not quite there yet."
</P>
<P>
Those at the Chicago meeting included Hillary Rodham Clinton,
Obama's choice for secretary of state; Vice President-elect
Joseph R. Biden Jr.; Gen. James L. Jones, who is to be Obama's
national security adviser; Susan E. Rice, who is to be ambassador
to the United Nations; Rahm Emanuel, who will be White House
chief of staff; Gregory B. Craig, who will be White House
counsel; James Steinberg, who is expected to be deputy secretary
of state; Thomas Donilon, who is expected to be Jones' deputy;
and Anthony Blinken, a senior foreign policy adviser to Biden.
</P>
<P>
Obama apparently did not ask Gates or Mullen for specifics on
withdrawals, according to people briefed on the discussions.
"There was not challenging or questioning of any particular
timetable," a transition official said. "There wasn't a point on
which there was any pushback from either side."
</P>
<P>
For his part, Geoff Morrell, the Pentagon press secretary, said
that Gates had left the Chicago meeting feeling that "they had an
excellent discussion, and excellent chemistry as well."
</P>
<P>
The plan drafted by Odierno and Petraeus was drawn up to meet the
so-called status of forces agreement between the United States
and Iraqi governments that calls for all American forces to be
out of Iraq by the end of 2011 and all combat troops out of Iraqi
cities by June 2009. The agreement sets forth both a shorter and
longer timetable than Obama's campaign pledge, with some combat
forces out sooner but all forces out later.
</P>
<P>
One way commanders say they will try to meet that first deadline
is by effectively reassigning combat troops to training and
support of the Iraqis, even though the difference would be in
some cases semantic because armed American troops would still go
on combat patrols with their Iraqi counterparts.
</P>
<P>
The participants at the Chicago meeting did discuss the deadline
for all American combat troops to be withdrawn from Iraqi cities
by June, as outlined in the agreement with the Iraqi government.
A person familiar with the talks said those at the meeting
discussed whether the Iraqis would allow "re-missioned" combat
forces to remain in Iraqi cities after June. Gates and Mullen did
not rule out the idea that Iraqis might permit such troops, the
person said.
</P>
<P>
In a briefing to reporters last week in Balad, Iraq, Odierno said
that some American forces would remain in a support role in Iraqi
cities beyond the June deadline. He said that the troops would be
deployed at numerous security outposts in urban areas to help
support and train Iraqi forces. "We'll maintain our very close
partnership with the Iraqi security forces throughout Iraq even
after the summer," he said.
</P>
<P>
Odierno said that it was particularly important for American
troops to support Iraqis in 2009, when three elections, at the
provincial, district and national levels, are scheduled. "It's
important that we maintain enough presence here that we can help
them through this year of transition," he said.
</P>
<P>
Odierno also said that he was planning for all American forces to
be out of Iraq by 2011, as called for in the agreement with the
Iraqi government, but he said the agreement could be
renegotiated. "Three years is a long time," Odierno said.
</P>
<P>
The new military plan also calls for American troops in Iraq
after 2011, but it does not put a number on that force, a person
familiar with its details said.
</P>
<P>
Other topics discussed at the meeting in Chicago included
Afghanistan, Pakistan, the Middle East, the detainees at
Guantanamo Bay and how the national security policy-making
process in the Obama administration would work.
