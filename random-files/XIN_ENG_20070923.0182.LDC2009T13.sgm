Exchange floor to downsize on Wall Street as neighborhood
transforms

NEW YORK, Sept. 23 (Xinhua)
</P>
<P>
In the next several weeks, the New York Stock Exchange plans to
shut two trading rooms that were added decades ago, when its
status as the place to buy and sell stocks was unchallenged, the
New York Times reported Sunday on its website.
</P>
<P>
The exchange has been the hub of financial activity in Lower
Manhattan for more than a century, but the buzz emanating from
its famous trading floor is dying down as computerized trading
has rapidly reduced the need for face-to-face transactions.
</P>
<P>
When the plan is completed, the exchange floor will be half the
size it was at its peak. The "crowd" -- the brokers and clerks on
the floor -- has dwindled to about 1,700 from a high of more than
3,000, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Before the exchange became a public company in 2005, its members
controlled 1,366 seats, or licenses to trade. Now, about 800
brokers pay the annual 50,000-dollar fee for a license.
</P>
<P>
The exchange's neighborhood is transforming just as quickly. Only
a few major financial firms, like Goldman Sachs and Bank of New
York, still maintain headquarters on or near Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
The blocks nearby, once filled with investment houses, are now
home to apartments and luxury goods stores like Tiffany and
Hermes.
</P>
<P>
The decline in activity at the exchange's headquarters at 11 Wall
Street is palpable. Tourists no longer queue up by the hundreds
to survey the floor from the visitors' gallery or watch the
ceremonial ringing of the opening and closing bells. Excluded for
security reasons since 9/11, they can only wander by the building
that has long symbolized the heart of American commerce.
</P>
<P>
Inside the exchange, a once-vital organ has been reduced to a
reliable backdrop for financial shows on cable. Even on its
busiest day, the trading floor is a sideshow compared with the
center-ring attraction it was several years ago.
</P>
<P>
Most of the action in shares listed on the New York Stock
Exchange happens electronically, between the computers of traders
at brokerage houses, mutual fund companies and home offices in
spare bedrooms.
</P>
<P>
City officials express hope that the executives who run the
exchange will find a way to maintain its image as the gold
standard of financial markets, but they are resigned to its
diminished physical presence and the permanent loss of jobs on
the floor, said the New York Times.
