Festival of Lights used to feature religious gifts, not Nintendos
Hanukkah By Nathan Hurst

SOUTHFIELD -- After Metro Detroit Jewish families lit the first
candle on their menorahs this week, many of the Hanukkah presents
exchanged weren't dreidels and gelts.
</P>
<P>
Instead in many Jewish homes, gifts of video game systems,
computers, toys and clothes pushed aside the traditional tokens
of the holidays--the spinning dreidel tops used for centuries to
teach tales of the Torah, the primary Jewish religious text, and
the foil-wrapped gelts, chocolates shaped like coins,
</P>
<P>
That shift has gotten the attention of the nation's retailers, as
they look to Hanukkah as a way to expand the gift-giving market.
</P>
<P>
Companies like Disney have developed products such as Mickey
Mouse-themed dreidels. Discounter Wal-Mart sells children's
Hanukkah books, dreidels and kitschy items like an 8-foot-tall
illuminated inflatable menorah for the front lawn. Department
store chain Macy's carries menorahs, dreidels and other Hanukkah
supplies, along with some themed gifts for the holiday.
</P>
<P>
Catalog and home shopping television outfits have embraced
Hanukkah as well. QVC is pitching nearly 100 Hanukkah gifts this
year. And home decorating catalogs Crate &amp;amp; Barrel and
Pier 1 Imports are pushing small holiday trees that Jewish
families can decorate as "Hanukkah bushes."
</P>
<P>
The potential "Christmasification" of Hanukkah, which usually
falls in December, has some traditionalists worried. This year,
Hanukkah began at sundown on Tuesday and will end at sundown next
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"I've encountered two schools of thought," said Joseph Krakoff,
Rabbi at Congregation Shaarey Zedek in Southfield. "Some want
Hanukkah at that same level of commercialization as Christmas,
because that makes everyone more aware of the holiday. But others
would rather resist it. They want more separation to avoid the
mode of thinking that Hanukkah is somehow intertwined with
Christmas."
</P>
<P>
Holiday remembers a miracle
</P>
<P>
Hanukkah is an eight-evening long "Festival of Lights," marking
the 165 B.C. victory of the Jewish Maccabee tribe over Syrian
forces and the miracle of one day's supply of lamp oil lasting
for eight full days, according to the Torah.
</P>
<P>
It holds much less importance for Jews than Yom Kippur, the
Jewish New Year, or Passover, which falls around Easter time.
</P>
<P>
But in recent years, the holiday has gotten more attention, much
of it from retailers vying for business from Jewish families.
</P>
<P>
Rebecca Miller, a 38-year-old mother of three elementary school-
aged children in Bloomfield Hills, said the pressure to make
Hanukkah more like Christmas is enormous. "We've gone traditional
in the past," said Miller, who is Jewish and married to a
Catholic. "But we're trying to integrate Hanukkah and Christmas
together as they grow up, and I think this is our middle ground."
</P>
<P>
This year, her children will receive CDs and clothing, while all
three will share a Nintendo Wii. But they'll still spin dreidels
by the menorah's glow during the eight nights of Hanukkah.
</P>
<P>
Retailers shifting gears
</P>
<P>
While it's unclear exactly how the shift from religious to
secular Hanukkah gift-giving has affected the retail market,
economists from the National Retail Federation earlier this year
predicted an increase in gift-buying by non-Christian families
celebrating holidays other than Christmas would be important in
the growth of this year's year-end sales.
</P>
<P>
Avrohom Plotnik, owner of Spitzer's Hebrew Book &amp;amp; Gift in
Southfield, said the move away from purely religious gifts means
he's had to change his approach to Hanukkah sales.
</P>
<P>
"Hanukkah has taken a new dimension," Plotnik said. "The gift-
giving isn't religious anymore."
</P>
<P>
So while families still buy replacement candles for menorahs or
oil for traditional lamps for cooking, other old-school gifts
have largely fallen out of style.
</P>
<P>
As a compromise, Plotnik stocks toys and games with religious
overtones, such as modern board games featuring Jewish themes,
along with toys, books and videos that teach Jewish history,
Hebrew or Yiddish.
</P>
<P>
On Web retailer oytoys.com, plush Hanukkah toys and DVD sets like
"Shalom Sesame," which features Sesame Street characters on a
journey through Israel also are popular.
</P>
<P>
Religious-themed toys "sell very, very well," Plotnik said. "It's
a great gift, but unfortunately, I don't think there's enough
growth in this type of toy because so many parents are shifting
to secular items instead."
</P>
<P>
Krakoff, the Rabbi in Southfield, said he sees a potential silver
lining in the commercialization of Hanukkah. Decorations, for
example, could serve an educational purpose.
</P>
<P>
"It would be an interesting thing to see more Jewish symbols up
during the holiday. I could see that message being much easier to
spread."HanukkaHAbout Hanukkah
</P>
<P>
What: Hanukkah marks the rededication of the Jewish temple in
Jerusalem after the victory of the Maccabee sect over Syrian-
Greek forces.
</P>
<P>
When: Hanukkah generally falls around Christmas. This year, it
began at sundown on Tuesday and will end at sundown on Dec. 12.

<P>
How it's celebrated: Hanukkah celebrations center around lighting
the menorah, spinning the dreidel and--especially in recent years
-- giving gifts to children. One candle is lit each of the eight
nights of the celebration during the recitation of traditional
prayers.
