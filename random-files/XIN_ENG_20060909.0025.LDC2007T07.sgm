KABUL, Sept. 9 (Xinhua) - Afghanistan's President Hamid  Karzai on
Saturday called on Afghans to adopt a policy of self- sufficiency and
stand on their feet.
</P>
<P>
"This is our obligation to follow the way of our martyrs,  defend our
freedom, rebuild country and stand on our feet," he  told thousands of
audience gathered to commemorate the fifth  anniversary of
Afghanistan's national hero, the late resistance  leader Ahmad Shah
Masoud.
</P>
<P>
Masoud and millions of Afghans, Karzai added, had sacrificed  their
lives for the independence of Afghanistan and so, it is for  the
people of this war-ravaged country to reconstruct and  safeguard it.
</P>
<P>
"I pray for the success of Afghanistan and call on all Afghans  to get
united and take the country towards progress and prosperity, " Karzai
noted.
</P>
<P>
Other Afghan officials, including advisor to President Mohammad Qasim
Fahim and former President Burhanudin Rabbani, paid tribute  to late
Masoud in their speeches.
</P>
<P>
Masoud, the former guerrilla leader who fought against ex- Soviet
Union in 1980s and then resisted Taliban's onslaught in  1990s, was
killed in Sept. 9, 2001.
</P>
<P>
Two Arabs, according to Masoud's comrades, disguising  themselves as
journalists, detonated their mine-laden camera,  killing Masoud during
an interview in the northeast Afghanistan's Takhar province.
