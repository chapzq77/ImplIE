MARINE ' S DEFENSE TEAM ABRUPTLY ENDS HEARING
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAMP PENDLETON, Calif.
</P>
<P>
A military hearing for a Marine squad leader accused of killing
17 Iraqi men, women and children in Haditha in 2005 ended
abruptly on Thursday, after only three days of testimony that
seemed to provoke more questions than answers.
</P>
<P>
Lawyers for the defendant, Staff Sgt. Frank D. Wuterich, had been
expected to call a fellow infantryman, who testified last week
against Wuterich, back to the stand. That witness, Lance Cpl.
Sanick Dela Cruz, had told the court that Wuterich killed five
unarmed Iraqi men who got out of a car near the scene of a
roadside bomb attack against the marines.
</P>
<P>
After a three-hour delay, however, the defense dropped its plan
to cross-examine Dela Cruz and the hearing ended.
</P>
<P>
Dela Cruz, who received immunity in April after prosecutors
dropped murder charges against him in exchange for his testimony,
had testified that Wuterich fired his M-16 rifle at the five men
as they stood near the car, some with their hands raised in
surrender. The defense had been expected to challenge that view.
</P>
<P>
Wuterich has admitted to shooting the men but said they began
running away, defying orders to halt. His lawyers argued that
running away in the moments after the bomb detonated could be
construed as a hostile act under the Marine Corps rules of
engagement in Iraq, where such attacks have posed the most
frequent and deadliest threat to U.S. troops.
</P>
<P>
But Wuterich's lawyers have not been able to prove that the men
were running away; on the contrary, testimony from a government
forensic expert said the men's wounds suggested that they were
not moving away when they were shot.
</P>
<P>
Wuterich, 27, of Meriden, Conn., is also charged with killing 12
other Iraqis, including seven women and children, in two homes
after a Marine officer, 1st Lt. William T. Kallop, ordered the
unit to clear an area south of the scene of the bomb. Kallop was
also granted immunity in return for his testimony.
</P>
<P>
Wuterich's hearing is the last involving the four men initially
charged with murder after the attack. Murder charges against one
of two enlisted men were dismissed in July.
</P>
<P>
Last month, Lt. Col. Paul J. Ware, who has presided over the
hearings for all three enlisted men in the Haditha case,
recommended dismissing all charges against the other enlisted
man, but no decision has been made.
</P>
<P>
Those two men -- Lance Cpl. Justin L. Sharratt and Lance Cpl.
Stephen B. Tatum -- were charged with killing nine people.
</P>
<P>
As a more senior marine, Wuterich has been portrayed by
prosecutors as responsible for not only his own actions but also
those of his men.
</P>
<P>
Before the proceeding closed, Wuterich read a nine-page statement
to Ware, who will advise a Marine general whether sufficient
evidence exists to forward the charges to a court-martial.
</P>
<P>
In the statement, Wuterich took responsibility for his decisions
in the heat of battle to kill people in the two houses who he
said were suspected of being armed insurgents, and for the order
he gave to his men to "shoot first, ask questions later."
</P>
<P>
"I wanted them to understand," he said, repeating a central
argument of his defense, "that hesitation to shoot would only
result in the four of us being killed."
