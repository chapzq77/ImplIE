Galveston: City isn ' t ready for residents '  return
</HEADLINE>

GALVESTON, Texas 2008-09-18 18:15:34 UTC

The barrier island community of Galveston is not ready for
residents to return even briefly to the city thrashed by
Hurricane Ike, officials said Thursday as they pleaded for at
least another week to make repairs.
</P>
<P>
Ike's death toll in the U.S. stood at 53, with 19 in Texas. In
the Caribbean, Ike killed more than 80 people.
</P>
<P>
Many of the city's services -- including water, sewer and power
-- are recovering but remain several days away from returning to
full function, City Manager Steve LeBlanc said. The only hospital
on the island is getting some power, but not enough to care for
the 60,000 residents of Galveston Island.
</P>
<P>
The extra strain placed on the city by the return of residents
would only slow the recovery effort, LeBlanc said.
</P>
<P>
"We don't have adequate water at this point for just taking a
shower, flushing a toilet," he said. "We're not there yet."
</P>
<P>
Authorities let residents and business owners back onto the
island briefly Tuesday to "look and leave," but quickly reversed
course after the decision created traffic jams that backed up for
miles Tuesday and Wednesday on Interstate 45, the only road onto
the island.
</P>
<P>
Officials ruled out a resumption of that policy Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"It's more confusing," Mayor Lyda Ann Thomas said. "We just want
to bring everyone home, and we'll try to do it next week."
</P>
<P>
Thomas told residents that by waiting they were "making it
possible for us to get you home in a week or so, instead of the
months it would take if the city's infrastructure were more
overwhelmed at this point."
</P>
<P>
Roughly 15,000 residents defied forecasters' warning of "certain
death" to ride out the storm on the barrier island, and many
remained there despite the repeated urgings of officials --
worried about threats that include mosquito-borne disease -- to
get out.
</P>
<P>
There are clear signs of life returning to Galveston. Cell phone
service had largely returned, and for the second day since the
storm hit, a grocery store was open, though it wasn't selling
meat or dairy items.
</P>
<P>
Galveston Police Chief Charles Wiley said since Ike hit,
authorities have seen only 11 cases of looting -- a rate he
called "phenomenally low."
</P>
<P>
There are fears there are more victims yet to be found. After
Hurricane Katrina hit New Orleans in 2005, bodies continued to
turn up for more than a year.
</P>
<P>
To the northwest in Houston, traffic on the downtown streets of
the fourth-largest U.S. city picked up Thursday, nearly a week
after the massive Category 2 storm plowed ashore on Galveston
Island. CenterPoint Energy said it had restored power to nearly
900,000 homes, approaching the point where more people in Houston
would be with electricity than without.
</P>
<P>
"If I could make a wish for a single magic bullet to move us
forward, it would be to get the power lines fixed," Homeland
Security Secretary Michael Chertoff said.
</P>
<P>
Chertoff was in Southeast Texas for the second straight day,
watching over the federal relief effort that has delivered
hundreds of trucks of ice, water and food to the region's more
than 5 million people.
</P>
<P>
Flight control of the International Space Station was to return
to the Johnson Space Center on Friday, NASA said Thursday. The
space center shut down a few days before Ike's strike.
</P>
<P>
Officials said the home of Mission Control incurred only minimal
damage from the storm. While the space flight center was closed,
the duties had been passed temporarily to backup facilities near
Austin and in Huntsville, Alabama.
