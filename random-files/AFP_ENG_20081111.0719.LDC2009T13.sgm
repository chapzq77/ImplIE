Suspected drug-related violence left 19 dead in the northern
Mexico border city of Ciudad Juarez, including a charred, armless
body dumped at a police station, local officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Officials at first said the body had been decapitated, but a
spokesperson for the local district attorney's office said late
Monday that the unidentified body, which had been thrown from a
car in front of the police station, had no arms.
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere, an armed commando shot and killed two men and two
women outside Ciudad Juarez hospital, a police official said.
</P>
<P>
Another 13 died in separate attacks in the violent city across
the border from the US city of El Paso, Texas, which has Mexico's
highest murder rate this year, with more than 1,300 killed.
</P>
<P>
Gangland-style attacks have left more than 4,000 dead across the
country this year, despite a vast federal crackdown including the
deployment of some 36,000 soldiers, launched almost two years
ago.
