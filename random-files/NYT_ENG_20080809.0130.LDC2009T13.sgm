CANDIDATES REACT TO CONFLICT IN GEORGIA

LAS VEGAS
</P>
<P>
When Russian troops rolled into South Ossetia on Friday, Sen.
John McCain's response was immediate and tough.
</P>
<P>
Russia had crossed "an internationally recognized border into the
sovereign territory of Georgia," and should "unconditionally
cease its military operations and withdraw all forces," said
McCain, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, in a
hastily arranged statement delivered on an airport tarmac.
</P>
<P>
Sen. Barack Obama, his Democratic rival, trod more carefully,
which was characteristic of his approach to foreign affairs. He
did not directly blame Russia and instead offered a more measured
response, focused on negotiations, which largely echoed the
official comments of the European Union, the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization and even President Bush.
</P>
<P>
"Now is the time for Georgia and Russia to show restraint, and to
avoid an escalation to full-scale war," Obama said in a statement
issued by his campaign. Although the statement added that
"Georgia's territorial integrity must be respected," it concluded
that "all sides should enter into direct talks on behalf of
stability in Georgia."
</P>
<P>
Although Obama did harden his rhetoric shortly before boarding a
plane for a vacation to Hawaii later on Friday -- he said that
"what is clear is that Russia has encroached on Georgia's
sovereignty" -- he remained far less confrontational than McCain.
</P>
<P>
The two responses to an incident unfolding in real time and
delivered in the midst of the political calculations of a
presidential campaign were indicators of how McCain and Obama
might respond to a crisis with international implications.
</P>
<P>
The fighting, which began when Georgian forces tried to retake
the capital of South Ossetia from insurgents in the pro-Russian
region of the Caucasus, was developing into the worst clash since
Russian troops invaded Afghanistan in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
McCain spoke to two crucial people on Friday before making his
statement: President Mikheil Saakashvili of Georgia, whom he has
known since 1997, and Steven J. Hadley, the White House national
security adviser. Saakashvili has been criticized for cracking
down on demonstrators last year, but McCain has been a loyal and
longtime ally.
</P>
<P>
McCain first heard about the crisis shortly before leaving
Cincinnati for Des Moines on Friday morning, and to gather more
information he made phone calls from his car on the way to the
airport. To prepare a statement, he then relied on his foreign
policy staff, including Randy Scheunemann, his chief foreign
policy aide, whose firm has lobbied for Georgia for the past four
years. Scheunemann, who has worked for McCain's campaign since
early 2007, took a leave from his firm, Orion Strategies LLC, in
March of this year.
</P>
<P>
After talking with his aides, McCain worked on his campaign plane
with Mark Salter, one of his closest advisers, on the wording of
the statement. He delivered it on the tarmac upon landing in Des
Moines.
</P>
<P>
Obama's response came in several stages. The campaign said its
initial statement was made before being able to confirm that
Russia had invaded Georgian territory, and so it was cautious
about assigning blame.
</P>
<P>
Obama was more judgmental in his own statement later on Friday,
and by Saturday his campaign stepped up the rhetoric once again.
"Clearly over the course of the last 24 hours this crisis has
escalated," said Ben Rhodes, a foreign policy aide. "Clearly
Russia bears the responsibility for that escalation."
</P>
<P>
Aides said Obama was also briefed by Hadley on Friday and was
kept informed on developments by his foreign policy advisers as
he flew to Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
Wendy Morigi, Obama's national security spokeswoman, said that in
recent days the campaign had spoken to experts including Sam
Nunn, a former senator of Georgia and an influential Democratic
voice on foreign policy; Michael A. McFaul, a Russia scholar at
Stanford University who heads the campaign's foreign policy team
on Russia and Eurasia; Richard Holbrooke, a former American
ambassador to the United Nations under President Bill Clinton;
and Lee Hamilton, a former Democratic representative of Indiana,
who now heads the Woodrow Wilson International Center.
</P>
<P>
Both campaigns also used the crisis to engage in their now-daily
political combat, which in this round focused on Scheunemann and
his ties to Georgia.
</P>
<P>
"John McCain's top foreign policy adviser lobbied for, and has a
vested interest in, the Republic of Georgia, and McCain has
mirrored the position advocated by the government," said Hari
Sevugan, a spokesman for the Obama campaign, who added that the
"appearance of a conflict of interest" was a consequence of
McCain's close ties to lobbyists.
</P>
<P>
Salter, of the McCain campaign, dismissed the criticism. "In the
middle of an international crisis, in which people are getting
killed, the best the Obama campaign can come up with is to cast
aspersions on a McCain staffer," he said.
</P>
<P>
Salter acknowledged that Scheunemann had lobbied for Georgia, but
said that McCain "has been involved in the efforts of former
Soviet Republics to embrace democracy and free-market values
since the end of the Cold War."
