EU stresses unity despite growing U.S.-Russian tensions over
Kosovo

BRUSSELS, Belgium 2007-07-23 11:39:35 UTC

<P>
EU nations sought Monday to maintain their unity in the face of
growing tensions between the United States and Russia over the
future of Serbia's breakaway province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"It's important that we establish our own position and are clear
about the need for a strong European leadership but also strong
European unity in this area," Britain's Foreign Secretary David
Miliband said as he arrived for the monthly meeting of EU foreign
ministers.
</P>
<P>
The EU's 27 members have been generally united in their support
for a U.N. resolution that would empower the union to deploy its
mission to the province and replace the current U.N.
administration there.
</P>
<P>
Still, some members such as Spain, Slovakia, Greece and Cyprus
have expressed reservations about the prospect of Kosovo gaining
independence without a Security Council resolution -- unlikely in
the face of Russian opposition -- and there are concerns that the
EU could split over the issue if it is remains unresolved.
</P>
<P>
The conference in Brussels comes just days after the United
States and the EU were forced to withdraw from the U.N. Security
Council their latest draft of a resolution on Kosovo's future.
Russia, a veto-wielding member of the council, opposed the
resolution on the grounds that it was a hidden route to
independence.
</P>
<P>
Instead, Washington and Brussels will try to open a new round of
talks between Serbia and its independence-seeking province
through a multinational group outside the Security Council known
as the Contact Group on Kosovo, which includes representatives
from the U.S., Britain, France, Italy, Germany, Russia.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations assumed control of Kosovo after a NATO-led air
war halted a Serbian crackdown on ethnic Albanian separatists in
the province in 1999. The world body, which has since then
administered the region of two million people -- 90 percent of
them Albanians -- is seeking a way to resolve Kosovo's final
status.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, former Finnish president and U.N. special
envoy Martti Ahtisaari recommended that the province be granted
limited independence, to be supervised by a team of European
Union officials.
</P>
<P>
Washington and the EU have backed the plan, which both Moscow and
Belgrade strongly oppose, arguing that granting independence to
Kosovo -- which technically remains part of Serbia -- would set a
precedent for separatists around the globe.
</P>
<P>
"Our own commitment to the Ahtisaari plan remains very strong,"
said Miliband, who was attending his first EU ministerial
conference.
</P>
<P>
German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier proposed that the
Contact Group be made more effective by appointing a single EU
envoy to represent the union instead of Britain, France, Italy,
Germany.
</P>
<P>
"Now that we all have to presume that there will not be a
Security Council resolution, I think it is important that we
don't leave the ongoing process to itself," Steinmeier said
