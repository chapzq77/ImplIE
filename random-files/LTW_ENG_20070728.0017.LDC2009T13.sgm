Waterwitch Looks Down, Not Up, for Drought Relief
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

On a sloping patch of withered grass at his Clarke County, Va.,
farm one recent afternoon, William Cross did what any seasoned
farmer touched with the gift will do in search of a spot to dig a
well. With his leathery hands, he gripped the handles of two
L-shaped copper rods, held them parallel, tucked his elbows into
his ribs, puffed out his chest, marched a few paces back and
forth and silently bid the earth to reveal its watery secrets.
</P>
<P>
Within seconds, the rods appeared to respond, flung across each
other by what Cross described as the hand of an invisible force.
</P>
<P>
``There they go!'' said the 82-year-old grandfather and former
book publisher -- and part-time water witch.
</P>
<P>
Also known as dowsers, most water witches say they are born with
a capacity to locate underground water by channeling its energy,
or electromagnetism, or something loopy and twitchy of that kind
that has yet to be named by science, through a pair of metal
rods, a forked twig, a coat hanger, a pendulum or, in rare cases,
acutely alert fingers.
</P>
<P>
In summers past, rural residents sometimes summoned a dowser to
seek water when wells dried up or droughts hit. A dry spell this
summer has led Maryland and Virginia to seek drought relief for
farmers and could prod more homeowners to turn to dowsers to find
productive wells. But well drillers today are often uneasy with
the practice.
</P>
<P>
``You're going to get me in trouble,'' Bob Leazer, of Leazer
Brothers Drilling and Pump Co., based in Remington in Fauquier
County, Va., responded when asked if he employs dowsers to locate
the wells his company drills in 13 Virginia counties. ``I've seen
a lot of people that used dowsers, and I've seen 'em hit and I've
seen 'em miss. And I can't say if it works.''
</P>
<P>
Some people decry dowsing as the handiwork of the devil; some
laud it as a gift from God. Others, in the name of rational
skepticism, just call it bunk. Yet the tradition endures. If
you're going to spend a small fortune poking holes in your back
yard to find water, the thinking goes, you might as well try
poking a spot marked -- often free of charge -- by a water witch.
</P>
<P>
David Shirley, 47, of Stephenson, Va.-based Shirley Well
Drilling, is a third-generation dowser. His father preferred
fresh limbs cut from a cherry or willow tree, but Shirley uses
brass rods to pinpoint and drill where he believes underground
streams cross -- a prime location for a multigallon-per-minute
well. He will dowse only if clients permit, but nearly all do,
said his wife, Jackie.
</P>
<P>
Detractors say there's no hard proof that the method works.
</P>
<P>
The National Ground Water Association has published a brochure
titled ``Before You Hire a Water Witch'' and declares itself
``strongly opposed'' to the practice. Experiments have shown that
the odds of finding water through dowsing are no better than
random attempts and that rods lack special powers, said Cliff
Treyens, the association's public awareness director.
</P>
<P>
``If I could hire a dowser to find 200-gallons-a-minute wells, I
would fire all my PhD scientists,'' added Jamie Emery of Emery
and Garrett Groundwater Inc. in New Hampshire. His company, which
works on Northern Virginia projects, uses satellite imagery and
seismic and geophysical tools to find potential well sites. But
those methods can cost tens of thousands of dollars for a study
in a small subdivision, out of the price range of many
homeowners. Several dowsers who were interviewed said they work
for free or charge a nominal fee.
</P>
<P>
Hydrogeologists say there is a strong chance of hitting
groundwater wherever one digs. Dowsers and their supporters say
that misses the point.
</P>
<P>
``You know there's water down there, but you want to hit it
within short order, and you don't want to hit haphazardly,'' said
Peter Holden, a Purcellville, Va., farmer who is a liaison to the
Virginia Association of Soil and Water Conservation Districts. He
said dowsers found him plentiful supplies on three properties.
</P>
<P>
The use of twigs and rods dates to biblical times, dowsers say.
Over the centuries, practitioners uttered incantations to empower
rods with divine grace to seek water and other hidden substances,
from precious metals to lost cats to bad vibes. Lore has it that
the term ``water witch'' derives not from a description of a
person but rather from the witch hazel branches preferred by
Anglo-Scottish immigrants.
</P>
<P>
Dowsers themselves debate how to define their practice, said
Arvid Johnson, operations manager of the 3,000-member American
Society of Dowsers, based in Vermont. But they agree on the need
for a clear mind and sharp focus.
</P>
<P>
``It's kind of like a hammer is to a carpenter. The hammer
doesn't build the house; the carpenter does. The rod doesn't find
water; the dowser does,'' said dowser Tom Stewart, 61, of North
Carolina, who recently retired as a teacher and started an online
business selling his homemade rods.
</P>
<P>
John Fincham Jr., 72, of Winchester, has a penchant for his
pendulum, an amethyst quartz stone hanging from a fine chain. By
spinning clockwise for yes or counterclockwise for no, the
pendulum channels a magnetism of sorts to answer questions that
transcend matter, Fincham said. On Cross's property in Clarke
County's Berryville one recent day, the pendulum oscillated
sharply as Fincham posed questions about water depth and flow.
</P>
<P>
Cross had called Fincham, who learned the art of dowsing at a
school in Arkansas, for a second opinion about where to drill a
new well.
</P>
<P>
``Relax. Don't try to grip 'em. Elbows by your sides,'' said
Fincham, coaching his friend with the 18-inch rods.
</P>
<P>
But until Cross finds $2,000 to get a driller and permits, the
presence of water at this spot would remain, rather like his
knack with rods, an enigma.
