Isolated Canadian lodge offers cozy hideaway in the Rockies

WATERTON LAKES NATIONAL PARK, Alberta 2007-01-11 01:08:52 UTC
</P>
<P>
My dilemma: Should I trudge through shin-deep snow to the side
door at the Kilmorey Lodge library? Or should I use the front
door, shooing away the doe and her fawn that have taken shelter
there from the falling snow?
</P>
<P>
I opt for the library door. The deer, after all, are one reason
we chose this isolated lodge in the almost-deserted village of
Waterton Lakes in the Canadian Rockies. This is their home; we
are merely visitors.
</P>
<P>
In summer, Waterton Lakes National Park is a popular mountain
destination for Canadian vacationers, smaller and less crowded
than the better known Banff and Jasper national parks to the
north. It also receives thousands of visitors who come north
across the U.S. border as part of their visit to Glacier National
Park, which abuts it.
</P>
<P>
Together, they form the Waterton-Glacier International Peace
Park, a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
</P>
<P>
But in winter, Glacier is essentially shut down. Its hotels and
restaurants are closed and boarded up, its high mountain roads
buried by deep, drifting snow. The border crossing that is the
summer shortcut from the U.S. to Waterton is barricaded until
summer.
</P>
<P>
Waterton Lakes, at the core of the Canadian park, comes close to
doing the same. The grocery store and the gas station are boarded
up; so is the fudge shop, the espresso bar and the ice cream
parlor. The summer population of more than 2,000 shrinks to
perhaps 100, many of them park staff. And even many residents in
nearby Montana assume Waterton has joined Glacier in winter
slumber.
</P>
<P>
But on the shore Waterton's Emerald Bay, a snug century-old lodge
remains open, a beacon of warmth offering cozy rooms and an
award-winning restaurant year around for those willing to make
the offseason trek.
</P>
<P>
We are here this weekend because the Kilmorey Lodge tops our list
of places where we most want to be snowed in. Our cross-country
skis are strapped on the car, and our snowshoes are in the trunk.
We seek a blend of adventure and solitude, but also a comfortable
bed, a warm fire, and gourmet meals served by cheerful and
attentive staff. Kilmorey offers it all.
</P>
<P>
Adventure isn't far away. Waterton plows a road eight miles (13
kilometers) up from the village into the high country of the
Rockies. From there the remaining two miles (three kilometers) of
unplowed road lead cross-country skiers or snowshoers to Cameron
Lake, nestled in a cirque at 5,450 feet (1,660 meters) hard
against the Continental Divide.
</P>
<P>
It is one of the easiest and safest ways for winter visitors to
view the high backcountry of the Canadian Rockies in winter.
Later in the season, when the ice is thicker and safer, Cameron
Lake itself becomes a thoroughfare for skiers. And all around are
forest and mountains, inviting explorers on snowshoes.
</P>
<P>
Back down in the townsite is Cameron Falls, a spectacular
waterfall on the edge of town that in winter is an easy
destination for skiers who want an adventure a bit short of true
wilderness.
</P>
<P>
Deer are common here, and they often bed down in the shelter of
trees near the Kilmorey. A small herd of Rocky Mountain bighorn
sheep also frequents the townsite. Lucky visitors may even catch
a glimpse of a mountain lion, searching for winter prey. This
also is serious grizzly bear country, but they are hibernating
this time of year and pose no threat.
</P>
<P>
Canada first protected Waterton as a park in 1895. In 1910, it
became forever linked to its giant neighbor to the south --
Glacier Park is eight times bigger in area -- when James Hill,
president of the Great Northern Railway in the U.S., decided to
make Glacier and Waterton "the playground of the Northwest" with
a network of hotels, camps, and chalets targeting wealthy
tourists who would travel on his railroad.
</P>
<P>
His son, Louis Hill, chose a knoll overlooking Waterton as the
spot for a new grand hotel, linked on a circuit to three others
in Glacier park. The Prince of Wales Inn, resembling a giant
alpine chalet, opened in 1927.
</P>
<P>
It still overlooks the village of Waterton, and staying there is
a highlight for many summer visitors. It is closed in winter, and
few even venture there because of the fierce and frigid winds
that can howl down Upper Waterton Lake. Those that do visit the
Prince of Wales can see the thick steel cables that literally
keep the huge hotel from blowing away.
</P>
<P>
At the townsite below, the wind is buffered by trees, and it is
calm when we return to the Kilmorey after our adventure on skis.
It makes for a pleasant evening stroll through the snow around
the shore of the partially iced-over Emerald Bay, listening to
the honking of hundreds of Canada geese.
</P>
<P>
Evening comes early in winter, and the glow from the lodge
windows is an invitation. Just off the lobby is a small, cheery
pub where we can sit by the fireplace and look out over the snowy
wilderness.
</P>
<P>
As in many old inns, the rooms are each unique and range from
cozy to spacious. But all have antique furniture, plump
mattresses and thick comforters that invite you to snuggle in and
sleep late. The rooms have no televisions, telephones or
dataports, and there is no cell phone service; this is not the
place for such intrusions.
</P>
<P>
Dining at Kilmorey is a treat; a list of Canadian restaurant
awards over the last few years fills a half page of the guest
directory, and plaques fill a wall in the Lamp Post dining room.
The menu and wine list belie the isolation of the small lodge.
</P>
<P>
This night we opt for an appetizer of black tiger prawns sauteed
with maple-infused Canadian whisky and a hint of crushed garlic.
For a main course we choose pescatorie -- scallops, clams,
mussels, shrimp, crab, calamari, cod and prawns sauteed with
garlic, Italian herbs and onion and finished with sauvignon blanc
and cream, then tossed with linguine.
</P>
<P>
Then we head to one of Kilmorey's most pleasant features -- the
back library, with its comfy armchairs gathered around a wood-
burning fireplace. You can choose to take your coffee and dessert
here after dinner. But it's always a quiet refuge, the perfect
place to curl up with a good book, listen to the crackle of the
fire and watch the softly falling snow deepen outside the door.
</P>
<P>
Perhaps we'll be snowed in. We can always hope.

The lodge contains 23 guest rooms, two of which are wheelchair-
accessible. Winter rates range from US$85-$168 (99 to 196
Canadian dollars), the latter for a two-room family suite; summer
rates are higher. In winter, the only food service in the village
is at the Kilmorey, where dinner entrees in the dining room range
from US$15-$34 (C$17-39). A more casual menu is available in the
inn's pub.
</P>
<P>
GETTING THERE: Waterton Lakes National Park is located in the
southwest corner of Alberta. From Calgary, Alberta, drive south
on Highway 2 to Cardston, then southwest on Highway 5 to
Waterton. From Great Falls, Montana, drive north on Interstate 15
and cross the U.S.-Canada border at Sweetgrass. Seven miles (11
kilometers) north of the border, turn west on Secondary Highway
501 and follow it to Cardston, then follow Highway 5.
