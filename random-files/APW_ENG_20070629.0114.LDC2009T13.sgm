The new "Transformers" movie boasts a good cast, but it's got
nothing on the original.
</P>
<P>
In a classic bit of movie trivia, the little-seen 1986 animated
film "Transformers: The Movie" was Orson Welles' last film. Yes,
that Orson Welles.
</P>
<P>
The filmmaking legend who remade cinema with "Citizen Kane"
(which just again topped AFI's list of 100 greatest movies),
directed "Touch of Evil," starred in "The Third Man," impeccably
adapted Shakespeare to the screen and panicked the nation with
his infamous radio broadcast of "War of the Worlds" -- concluded
his career by playing Unicron, an evil shape-shifting planet
moon.
</P>
<P>
Welles was 70 at the time and in poor health. His last released
film was 1987's "Someone to Love," but that was shot before
Welles lent his voice to "Transformers." Late in his career,
Welles often took to commercials and narration work as a source
of income.
</P>
<P>
Author Barbara Leaming spent many days with Welles in his last
three years for her book, "Orson Welles: A Biography." She
recalls Welles telling her shortly before he died that he had
spent the day "playing a toy."
</P>
<P>
"That was for him a way of earning a living and a way of trying
to finance the films that he wanted to make," says Leaming.
"Obviously in those years, there's a tremendous sadness except
that the thing he used to always say to me was, `The one thing
that's helped me to survive is that I'm not bitter.'"
</P>
<P>
Having built his reputation in theater and radio, Welles'
immediate, astounding success as a 25-year-old filmmaker with
"Citizen Kane" (1941) is Hollywood legend. Though he went on to
create a number of masterpieces (among them "The Magnificent
Ambersons" and "Othello"), he is often viewed as failing to
recapture his early brilliance.
</P>
<P>
In his later decades, Welles had great difficulty gaining
financing for his film projects. Leaming says he used to refer to
parts like "Transformers" as "a job of work," but says he was
nevertheless full of ideas and spoke passionately of plans for
various movies even on his deathbed. He died of a heart attack in
October 1985.
</P>
<P>
"He was absolutely the same man who made `Citizen Kane,'" says
Leaming of the aged Welles.
</P>
<P>
His voice work in "Transformers: The Movie" was so weak that it
was altered with synthesizers until it hardly sounded like him.
Flint Dille, story consultant on the film, remembers Welles'
warm, magnanimous personality.
</P>
<P>
"He came in ... and said, `I'm playing an entire planet!'" Dille
recalled on a DVD of the film released last year.
</P>
<P>
The part is in some ways typical of the characters to which
Welles was drawn. Film critic and historian David Thomson, who
wrote "Rosebud: The Story of Orson Welles," once described Welles
as being attracted to "distorted portraits of grandeur."
</P>
<P>
Welles was not the only famous talent to lend his voice to
"Transformers: The Movie." He was joined by Eric Idle ("Monty
Python"), Leonard Nimoy ("Star Trek"), Judd Nelson ("The
Breakfast Club") and Robert Stack ("Unsolved Mysteries"). In this
way, "Transformers: The Movie" presaged a contemporary
commonplace: cartoons voiced by stars. Today, an animated film
wouldn't dream of not casting well-known performers.
</P>
<P>
"It was groundbreaking to introduce these famous actors in an
animated feature," "Transformers: The Movie" producer Joe Bacal
says on the DVD.
</P>
<P>
Back in 1986, though, it wasn't the payday it is now.
"Transformers: The Movie" yielded less than $6 million at the box
office. The new live-action "Transformers," which opens in
theaters July 3, hopes to reap that in a matter of hours. The
path of "Transformers" reflects the changed nature of Hollywood.
What began as a toy for children in the early '80s, has now
become an enormous, global Goliath of pop-culture product, meant
as much for adults as kids.
</P>
<P>
It's a destiny for "Transformers" that few could have imagined in
1986, even Welles himself. Indeed, "Transformers: The Movie" is
set in the distant future: the year 2005.
