China and Australia upgraded their security ties Thursday,
announcing annual talks on international issues and overseeing a
new energy trade deal that underscores their flourishing economic
relations.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister John Howard and Chinese President Hu Jintao
announced plans for a yearly security dialogue after a morning of
talks. The two also discussed climate change -- the core issue at
a weekend summit of Pacific Rim leaders.
</P>
<P>
Hu's meeting with Howard comes a day after the Australian leader
spent a day hosting U.S. President George W. Bush. While Hu and
Howard did not exude the easy rapport that Howard and Bush have,
the Australian and Chinese leader had much to celebrate.
</P>
<P>
Among agreements signed by their entourages was one for Woodside
Petroleum Ltd. to supply liquefied natural gas to state-run
PetroChina Co. -- a deal worth up to 35 billion Australian
dollars (US$28.8 billion euro21 billion), Howard said. China
agreed to donate two pandas to the Adelaide Zoo in southern
Australia.
</P>
<P>
Howard, in remarks to a conference of business executives, noted
that Australia was in its 16th straight year of economic
expansion and credited China's explosive emergence as
contributing to it.
</P>
<P>
"China's growth is undeniably good for the world. It has been
undeniably good for Australia," Howard said.
</P>
<P>
Taking the podium after him, Hu echoed Howard, saying, "China's
sound and steady economic growth has not only benefited China's
1.3 billion people, but also offered enormous business
opportunities to other countries."
</P>
<P>
Hu's visit was not friction-free. Hu was pressed by reporters on
a string of recalls and import bans on Chinese products and foods
badly made or tainted with toxic substances.
</P>
<P>
On climate change, Howard is seeking a strong endorsement for a
new approach to global warming from the leaders at the 21-member
Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit. Hu, however, only
reiterated China's stock position -- that while global warming is
a problem, it is largely the fault and responsibility of already
industrialized nations.
</P>
<P>
In an indirect slap at Howard's agenda for APEC, Hu said he hoped
that the summit's declaration would note that U.N.-sponsored
talks "should remain the main channel" for the international
efforts to tackle climate change.
</P>
<P>
While the new security talks between Australia and China, which
will be convened by foreign ministers next year, marks an upgrade
in ties, its announcement comes as Australia also upgrades its
security ties with Pacific allies the United States and Japan,
who are traditional or potential rivals with China.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Bush and Howard announced an agreement to give
Australian businesses access to U.S. defense contracts.
</P>
<P>
Howard is due to hold security talks on Saturday with U.S.
President George W. Bush and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe,
in a meeting that Beijing has already criticized as being
insufficiently transparent.
</P>
<P>
Asked by reporters if the Australia-U.S.-Japan dialogue
represented a threat to China, Hu said the countries involved
were better able to explain their intentions.
</P>
<P>
Howard said the three-way talks were not directed at China, whose
rapid military buildup has been a source of concern in Washington
and other regional capitals.
</P>
<P>
"The trilateral dialogue between Australia, Japan and the U.S. is
not directed at anyone, anymore than the strategic dialogue I
have just announced between Australia and China is not directed
at anyone," Howard said.
</P>
<P>
Officials have not elaborated on the particular security concerns
Australia, Japan and the U.S. will address, beyond saying they
were issues of common interest.
</P>
<P>
The three governments, which have two-way security agreements
between them but no formal three-way arrangement, have worked
together on terrorism, the Iraq war and curbing suspected North
Korean proliferation of nuclear and other dangerous materials.
