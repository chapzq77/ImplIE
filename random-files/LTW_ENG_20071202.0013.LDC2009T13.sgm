Islam Is on the Rise in Repressed Tunisia
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The siblings' chain-reaction quest for holy war was ignited in
2003, when Qabil Nasri, a tall man with a sparse beard, was
imprisoned on terrorism charges. His case radicalized his
siblings, two of whom were arrested after sneaking into
neighboring Algeria to train with Islamist militants. A third was
caught before he crossed the mountainous border to join them.
Nasri was freed in 2005; his brothers, including a former police
officer, are still in prison.
</P>
<P>
The Nasri family saga poses   dilemmas for Tunisia, a U.S. ally
whose beach resorts and cities emanating a bygone colonial charm
are among the most popular tourist destinations in the Arab
world.
</P>
<P>
The nation wears an intriguing facade. Women enjoy a degree of
liberation, men in suits have their shoes polished while reading
newspapers on the sidewalks -- and secret police slip in and out
of lives like uninvited guests.
</P>
<P>
Decades of stifled religious and political freedoms have ignited
two trends: an underground radicalism producing militants willing
to wage jihad in Iraq, Afghanistan and Europe, and a more
moderate, yet potent, religious yearning that can be seen in the
increasing numbers of beards and head scarves in cafes and on
university campuses.
</P>
<P>
The Nasri brothers and thousands of young Tunisians like them
epitomize the intersection of ideological currents and
technological wizardry fueling Islamic extremism across North
Africa. Raised under the repression that has long defined their
nation, and outraged by the Iraq war and the Israeli-Palestinian
conflict, the brothers turned to satellite television and the
Internet, where they found provocative mullahs and subversive Web
sites beyond the reach of government censors.
</P>
<P>
"A young man cannot find true Islam in state-sanctioned
religion," Nasri said. "So a young man, with all his power,
starts searching for messages on TV and the Internet. ... Young
Tunisians are peaceful, but when we face pressures because we are
religious, our thoughts start to change. Why are we subjected to
this? Why are they attacking my religion? Eventually, a young man
starts to think that his government is the enemy of Islam."
</P>
<P>
A Tunisian government official, who asked not to be named,
acknowledged the rise in extremism, the dangerous prospect of
battle-hardened Tunisian Islamic militants returning from Iraq
and what he described as the "Internet seepage" of radical Islam.
</P>
<P>
"It's a great concern for all North Africans," he said. "But
these Islamist militants don't have the appeal of the Islamists
of decades past. They're a very radical sub-phenomenon. They are
influenced by radical organizations that operate across borders.
But our security forces are ready. We are careful and vigilant."
</P>
<P>
A Western diplomat who requested anonymity said, "I think the
Tunisians are beginning to wake up. They used to see it as a
blip: `Let these young guys go to Iraq -- what do we care?' But
now they're dealing with these guys coming home."
</P>
<P>
In 2005, about 300 Tunisians were jailed for religious-inspired
militant activity. In the  past year, that number has jumped to
2,000, mainly the result of a new Anti-Terror Law that has
security forces scouring mosques and mountain crevices for
suspected radicals, said Samir Ben Amor, a lawyer in Tunis, the
capital, who represents dozens of alleged extremists.
</P>
<P>
This year, police killed more than 20 militants in a series of
gun battles in a suburb of the capital and in mountains near the
Algerian border. The extremists, including Tunisians and a
Mauritanian, were part of a group that trained in Algeria and
allegedly was planning attacks on the U.S. and other Western
embassies in Tunis.
</P>
<P>
The Algerian connection was another indication of affiliations
forming among militants across North Africa, most notably around
the Algerian-based Salafist Group for Call and Combat, known by
its French initials, GSPC.
</P>
<P>
The mobilizing passion for many young Tunisian Islamists is the
Iraq war and the perception that their nation is a proxy in
Washington's wider battle against the Muslim world. Defeating
U.S. interests in Iraq and Afghanistan, their thinking goes,
would weaken the regime of Tunisian President Zine el Abidine ben
Ali, whose 20 years in power have been marked by frequent
criticism from human-rights groups over torture, random arrests
and other harsh tactics of security forces.
</P>
<P>
"Despite the Tunisian government's attempts to ban the veil,
beards, and to jail Islamists, there's a religious revival in the
nation. The veil has swept the streets, and the Islamists are
here," Ben Amor said. "Ninety-five percent of Islamist terror-
related cases involve young people who only started praying two
to three years before their arrests. Government oppression at
home and the Iraq war have turned them into time bombs."
</P>
<P>
Jamila Ayed slips two pictures out of her black purse. They are
of the sons she has lost to Islamic militancy. The younger,
Marwen, was studying business at a university when he left to
fight in Iraq, where he died in Fallujah in 2004. The older,
Maher, was an engineering student whose college ID card was
confiscated by police, who told him he wouldn't get it back until
he shaved off his beard. He is now serving a 10-year sentence for
belonging to a terrorist organization. Ayed mourns her sons less
than she celebrates what they have done.
</P>
<P>
"Our government doesn't have any sovereignty. It does the work of
the Americans and the Zionists," she said. "The religious
resurgence is much stronger here than it was in the 1990s. This
new movement includes the rich and the poor, the rural and the
city, and the religious and those who had not been religious
before.
</P>
<P>
"My sons were depressed at Friday prayers and by the sermons they
heard from government-controlled preachers. They looked for the
true version of Islam on TV, the Internet and in banned books."
</P>
<P>
Ayed sat next to another mother, Noura Ben Slimene, whose pale,
angular face seemed to glow against a black hijab. Her son, Anas,
fought with the insurgency in Baghdad and died, she said, in a
U.S. airstrike along the Iraqi-Syrian border.
</P>
<P>
"He came to me and said, `I'm going to Iraq. I need my passport.
I'm prepared to do this for God,' " Slimene said. "I felt the
same way about the injustice he saw. I was convinced he was going
to fight injustice. ... In the neighborhood where I live, the
police arrest many people who feel like my son."
</P>
<P>
Ayed gathered her pictures, and she and Slimene walked down a
drizzly side street and into the gaze of President Ben Ali, whose
image hovers on billboards and posters across the city. Ben Ali
is everywhere, Tunisians say, in their neighborhoods, on the
coastal cliffs, at the desert's rim, even in the ancient city of
Carthage, where whitewashed homes with blue shutters look out
into the haze at yachts and tankers crossing the Mediterranean.
</P>
<P>
Violence in the 1980s and early '90s prompted Ben Ali's
government to arrest hundreds of Islamists and crack down on
religious organizations, including the Nahda movement, whose
leader, Rachid Ghannouchi, lives in exile in Britain. The
government licensed mosques, banned religion-influenced political
parties and stripped national identity cards from 10,000 to
15,000 suspected radicals. Human-rights groups complained that
the measures violated religious freedom.
</P>
<P>
"The radicalism today is the result of Tunisia not allowing even
moderate Islam to exist," said Ali Larayedh, a member of Nahda
who spent 14 years in prison. "But this radicalism is not a large
part of the Islamist revival we're seeing in Tunisia. ... The
government is exaggerating the radical threat to justify the
blockade it imposes on Islam."
</P>
<P>
A young man with a receding hairline sat in a wind breaker, his
hands nervously folded. He would give his name only as Abdel. In
2003, he was one of six men and boys charged with downloading
subversive Internet files and trying to make a bomb in the
southern town of Zarzis. He was 17 when he went to prison and 20
when he was freed. The case became a national sensation, pitting
a government wanting to show it was fighting terrorism against
critics who claimed security forces were exaggerating Islamic
threats and making arrests to impress the United States.
</P>
<P>
"The police said I was a Salafi, a radical. I didn't know what
Salafi meant back then," Abdel said. "I was tortured. My face was
paralyzed for a while. I signed some papers confessing to things,
but I don't really know what I signed. The police still follow
me. I've noticed young Tunisians have changed a lot since I went
into prison. They have gone to either radical Islam or criminal
delinquency."

Qabil Nasri stood the other day along a roadside near a pile of
bricks on the outskirts of Menzel Bourguiba. Rain had come the
night before; the fields were muddy, and the lake, separated from
the Mediterranean by a rim of hills, was still.
</P>
<P>
The Greeks and the Phoenicians sailed these waters centuries ago.
Then came the French and the Soviets, but the shipyards and the
steel mill are not as busy as they once were, and young men
gather in clumps at the Cafe Flamenco.
</P>
<P>
There was no coffee-shop idling for Nasri. In 2003, he crossed
Tunisia's rugged terrain and was arrested at the Algerian border,
where he was charged with belonging to a terrorist group. He said
he wanted to fight  with the Palestinians, but police said the
leaders of his group were planning terrorist attacks in Tunisia.
</P>
<P>
Nasri has remained defiant. Because his young face wears a light
beard, most employers, under government pressure, will not hire
him. He often violates parole by not reporting to police
stations, each time spending a month in prison.
</P>
<P>
Discussing his frustration, Nasri paused as two men came across
the field and tried to eavesdrop.
</P>
<P>
"In prison, the guards and interrogators insulted God in front of
me," he said. "They wanted to take my religion."
