China's more than 100 million migrant workers do not have a
single representative in the nation's parliament, but that may
soon change, state media said Thursday.

Lawmakers attending the annual session of parliament will vote on
a bill stipulating provinces and municipalities with large
numbers of migrant workers set aside a delegate quota for the
group, Xinhua news agency reported.

The National People's Congress brings together nearly 3,000
delegates from across the country, but not one is a migrant
worker, according to the agency.

"China's migrant labourer population has become larger...They
should have a number of lawmakers to represent their rights and
interests," Sheng Huaren, vice chairman of parliament's Standing
Committee, was quoted as saying.

There are different figures for the exact number of migrant
workers in China.

Xinhua gave a number Thursday of about 200 million migrant
workers, of which more than 120 million work in cities and the
remainder work in towns.

Another 13 million farmers will become migrant workers annually
in the coming years, it said.

Millions of migrant labourers fuelling China's economic boom are
forming an urban underclass deprived of rights and victims of
widespread abuse, human rights group Amnesty International said
in a report published in early March.

<P>
Despite ongoing economic reforms, China's migrant workers are
shut out of the health care and education system, live in
appalling conditions and are exposed to exploitative work
practices, the London-based group said.
