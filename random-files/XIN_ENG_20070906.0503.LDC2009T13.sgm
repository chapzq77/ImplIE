An Islamic web site will issue a new video message of al-Qaida
leader Osama bin Laden to mark the sixth anniversary of Sept. 11
attacks, U.S.-based SITE intelligence group said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
SITE said on its website that it has learned that a new video
message is forthcoming from the head of al-Qaida, Osama bin
Laden, addressing the American people on the sixth anniversary of
the attacks of September 11, 2001.

<P>
The website also posted an image from the forthcoming video.

The image of bin Laden contained in the banner found on jihadist
forums is reminiscent of his last video appearance in 2004, but
his beard is now completely black, as it was previously streaked
with grey.
