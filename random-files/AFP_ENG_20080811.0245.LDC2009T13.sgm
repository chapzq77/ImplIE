Football: Capello makes World Cup vow
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fabio Capello has guaranteed England will qualify for the 2010
World Cup in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Capello is in confident mood ahead of the World Cup qualifying
campaign, which begins against Andorra on September 6, and the
Italian believes England have more than enough quality to reach
the finals.
</P>
<P>
The main obstacle to England's progress will be Croatia, who
stopped Steve McClaren's team reaching Euro 2008 when they won
3-2 at Wembley last year.
</P>
<P>
But Capello isn't concerned about any opponent and made the kind
of bullish prediction that could come back to haunt him in two
years time.
</P>
<P>
"We will qualify for the World Cup. We will be in South Africa. I
am sure of it," he said. "We are a very good team. It is always
the same. For us, the opponent is not important. The important
thing is what we do."
</P>
<P>
England's failure to qualify for Euro 2008 led to claims that
Capello has taken over a squad lagging behind the rest of Europe
in technical and tactical ability.
</P>
<P>
But the Italian watched most of the tournament, which finished
with Spain's final triumph over Germany, and saw nothing that
made him think England were inferior.
</P>
<P>
"I watched some games live and saw the rest on TV," he said.
"Only Spain played in a different style. Only the characteristics
of their play was different.
</P>
<P>
"But I have a lot of confidence in my team and I think we will be
okay."
</P>
<P>
Capello, who was speaking at the National Football Festival at
Wembley which was organised by McDonalds, will name his squad for
next Wednesday's friendly against the Czech Republic after
Saturday's Premier League matches.
</P>
<P>
The former AC Milan and Real Madrid coach will then reveal his
new captain on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Rio Ferdinand has been tipped as Capello's favoured choice ahead
of John Terry, Steven Gerrard and David Beckham and the England
coach will give his chosen one the good news when the squad meet
up next week.
</P>
<P>
"I will announce the captain two days before the game," Capello
said. "I will speak with the captain just a moment before I tell
the rest of the squad, then everyone else will find out."
