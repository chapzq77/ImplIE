Malaysian island may lose heritage status over building row:
report

<P>
Malaysia's Penang island, world-renowned for its architecture and
culture, could lose its UNESCO world heritage listing if four new
high-rise hotels are built in its capital, reports said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Chief Minister Lim Guan Eng told the New Straits Times his
government was in a bind as the buildings exceed the 15-metre
(49-foot) maximum UNESCO height guidelines but were approved by a
previous government before heritage status was granted.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot afford to call off the projects as the developers will
take legal action against the local authorities so we must face
the reality of losing the UNESCO status," Lim was quoted by the
paper as saying.
</P>
<P>
The chief minister said the state government would discuss the
matter with the Culture, Arts and Heritage ministry to find a
solution.
</P>
<P>
UNESCO's regional adviser Richard Engelhardt told the Star Daily
the state government had no choice but to adhere to the World
Heritage Committee (WHC) guidelines.
</P>
<P>
"When the status is approved, the guidelines trump all previous
existing regulations," he told the paper, adding: "Why would you
apply for the status if there was no intention of following the
guidelines?"
</P>
<P>
Georgetown along with the port city of Malacca were awarded
heritage status in July after years of waiting for recognition.
Penang's capital was honoured for its colonial-era pre-World War
II buildings.
</P>
<P>
It also boasts a multi-cultural living heritage of ethnic groups
including Malays, Indians, Chinese, Eurasians, Armenians,
Japanese, Britons, Jews, Filipinos and Indonesians.
</P>
<P>
Malacca chief minister Mohammad Ali Rustam urged Lim to prevent
any "illegal" development in Georgetown that could jeapordise the
heritage status of both cities as the recognition was given
jointly, the New Straits Times reported.
