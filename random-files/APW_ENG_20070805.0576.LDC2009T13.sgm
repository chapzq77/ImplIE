care of them

JERUSALEM -- Elderly Holocaust survivors demonstrated outside
Israel's parliament Sunday, demanding the Jewish state increase
what they say is a derisory $20 monthly stipend.
</P>
<P>
Six decades after World War II, about 240,000 survivors live in
Israel and many say that instead of spending their final years in
dignity, they lack money for medicines, psychological treatment
and in some cases even for food.
</P>
<P>
Josef Charney was 17 when a cargo train carried him from the
Warsaw ghetto to the Treblinka death camp, the yellow star on his
chest marking him as a Jew targeted for eradication by the Nazis.
</P>
<P>
Now 82, Charney donned a yellow star once again on Sunday to
protest Israel's treatment of its Holocaust survivors.
</P>
<P>
Charney was among at least 500 survivors and supporters who
rallied outside the parliament building, carrying placards and
wearing stickers reading "The Holocaust is still here" and
"Forgive us for surviving."
</P>
<P>
"I want (the government) to let them die with peace and dignity,"
Charney said, adding that he was marching for survivors not well
enough to come themselves. "The government of Israel has not
recognized us. We don't belong to them."
</P>
<P>
Six million Jews were killed by the Nazis during World War II,
and hundreds of thousands who survived concentration camps came
to Israel after the war. Many suffered physical or psychological
damage from the torture and deprivation they suffered at the
hands of the Nazis.
</P>
<P>
The current flare-up over Israel's treatment of Holocaust
survivors began last week, when the government announced $28
million in new stipends for 120,000 needy survivors -- about half
of those now in Israel.
</P>
<P>
That works out to just 83 shekels -- or $20 -- a month for each
survivor, a sum critics deemed woefully inadequate.
</P>
<P>
"We don't think that 83 shekels a month is enough" said Gal Rotem
of the Holocaust Survivors' Welfare Fund, which helped organize
the march. "You can't buy food or drugs or anything else with 83
shekels."
</P>
<P>
By definition an elderly group, many of whom are unwell, an
average of 35 of the survivors die each day, she added.
</P>
<P>
At Sunday's weekly Cabinet meeting, Prime Minister Ehud Olmert
said the issue was "sensitive and painful" and acknowledged that
previous governments had failed to address it.
</P>
<P>
He added that he would meet Wednesday with representatives of
survivors' groups and the heads of various government ministries
to find the "best, fairest and most just solution," a statement
from his office quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
Sunday's protesters, however, doubted the government would act
quickly.
</P>
<P>
"Until they say what the solution is, we won't believe anything
else," Rotem said. "It's not a good feeling that Holocaust
survivors have to walk and march to say to Olmert that they are
still alive and need help."
</P>
<P>
Others expressed sadness that Israeli has not helped survivors
more.
</P>
<P>
Walking arm-in-arm with her granddaughter, 76-year old Brana
Fogel said she entered Auschwitz with her six brothers and
sisters. Only two of them survived the infamous extermination
camp.
</P>
<P>
In 1951 Fogel came to Israel, where her whole family now lives.
</P>
<P>
"My revenge is to be here in Israel with daughter and
granddaughter," she said. "But thinking about how other survivors
live...my heart just hurts."
</P>
<P>
"We can't imagine what they went through," added her daughter,
Yardit Ishai. "I can't stand the thought that someone who was
hungry, that someone who was almost killed, is hungry today."
</P>
<P>
As the marchers listened to speeches by survivors, Sari Rivkin of
Jerusalem leaned on a sign with three black and white photos of
Holocaust survivors.
</P>
<P>
In her work as the head of an Israeli nonprofit, she said, she
had seen survivors who have to chose between buying food or
medicine.
</P>
<P>
"The government's response is to delay as long as possible,
hoping the problem will go away," she said. "Unfortunately, these
people are going away. They are dying every day."
