Roundup: Bali conference in full swing, still bumpy road ahead

BALI, Indonesia, Dec. 11 (Xinhua)
</P>
<P>
As the UN Climate Change Conference in Bali is running into the
second week of negotiations, the various contact groups are
intensifying efforts to maximize progress before the arrival of
Ministers for the High-Level segment that starts on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Contact groups and informal consultations continued Tuesday as
United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon joined the
discussions here on Tuesday morning to add to voices for global
actions on climate change.
</P>
<P>
One of the areas of visible disagreement at the Bali Conference
is the need for quantified national emission targets for
industrialized countries -- guided by the range of 25-40 percent
reductions by 2020 -- and the need for emissions to peak in the
next 10-15 years.
</P>
<P>
The IPCC suggests that a reduction in greenhouse gases in the
range of 25-40 percent by 2020 is necessary in order to keep the
earth's temperature from rising 2 degrees Celsus.
</P>
<P>
The European Union (EU) has suggested that a roadmap would
require a "long-term" vision and that includes setting such a
target. The United States, however, has maintained that the Bali
document should not contain targets or any other goals that would
"prejudge" the outcome of the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
However, one notable success so far is the agreement on Monday
evening on the Adaptation Fund, with the final text being greeted
by enthusiastic applause.
</P>
<P>
In a daily press briefing on Tuesday, UNFCCC Executive Secretary
Yvo de Boer hailed the agreement as "encouraging".
</P>
<P>
Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate
Change (UNFCCC) agreed on Monday how the Adaptation Fund will
operate, including its governing body, functions, secretariat,
trustee and other institutional arrangements.
</P>
<P>
"The decision on the GEF as the Secretariat and the World Bank as
trustee was widely expected, although the reference to this as an
interim arrangement up for review every three years was a
surprise to me," says one observer.
</P>
<P>
"I think most of us are delighted to have finalized the Fund
whether you like the precise details or not," adds another.
</P>
<P>
Parties also acknowledged the need to strengthen existing
commitments and enhance their implementation, especially with
regard to developing countries.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, delegates continued on Tuesday discussions over the
Co-Facilitators '"non-paper"on the Convention track distributed
later on Saturday. While there was almost universal endorsement
of the text as a sound basis for negotiations, the jury was still
out on the ability of parties to project a common vision in a
Bali roadmap.
</P>
<P>
Some parties were already positioning themselves for several long
days of talks, with initial sparring reported regarding language
on targets, and which countries these should apply to.
</P>
<P>
"The text is a good start, but I don't think we'll see an
agreement on the roadmap before Friday," warns a delegate.
</P>
<P>
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon will deliver a statement at the
opening of the High-Level segment on Wednesday and the segment is
due to end on Friday. During these last three days of the
conference, Environment Ministers will seek to reach agreement on
the shape of a future international climate pact, the so- called
" Bali roadmap".

<P>
The United Nations Climate Change Conference opened on the
Indonesian island on Dec. 3.
