Racing: Sydney's top race course under horse flu lockdown
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One of Australia's top racecourses was put under a strict
lockdown Thursday after a racehorse tested positive for equine
influenza, as the virulent bug appeared to spread to the
thoroughbred industry.
</P>
<P>
Vets were urgently carrying out tests to confirm whether the
horse at Sydney's Royal Randwick Racecourse was infected, but the
initial outcome appeared to realise the racing industry's worst
fears, officials said.
</P>
<P>
"We have taken a second test but the first one showed all the
signs of being positive," Racing New South Wales chief executive
Peter V'Landys said.
</P>
<P>
"The previous tests have been accurate so we are holding little
hope. The test on the second sample will be expedited and we
should know for certain later," he said. "It is such bad news."
</P>
<P>
Trainer Anthony Cummings said the suspect horse had an elevated
temperature but he was hoping tests would still clear the animal
of infection.
</P>
<P>
"I'm still hopeful there is an outside chance the test will come
back negative," Cummings told Australian radio. "The symptoms are
not present in him or the horses around him but we will wait and
see."
</P>
<P>
The unprecedented outbreak of equine flu in Australia was first
detected among recreational and pleasure horses a week ago,
forcing a halt to all movements of horses across the country and
a cancellation of all race meetings.
</P>
<P>
The outbreak has left the multi-billion dollar racing industry
reeling and wiped millions in turnover from the major betting
firms.
</P>
<P>
But racing was expected to resume this weekend in all states
apart from Queensland and New South Wales, where officials had
hoped they could restart races in a limited form in the next
couple of weeks.
</P>
<P>
If the positive result for horse flu in a thoroughbred is
confirmed, the racing calendar in New South Wales is likely to
remain blank for some time, with experts predicting Randwick will
be locked down for at least a month
</P>
<P>
NSW Primary Industries Minister Ian McDonald says the state's
spring racing carnival, the premier event for the year, was is in
jeopardy if equine influenza was confirmed among the
thoroughbreds as Randwick.
</P>
<P>
"It would then place the place under total quarantine, and there
wouldn't be any possibility for racing for quite some time,"
McDonald told ABC radio.
</P>
<P>
Some 700 thoroughbreds are stabled at Randwick and trainer John
O'Shea said the racing community was despondent about the
prospect of a horse flu outbreak.
</P>
<P>
"Once one horse is diagnosed, we all know there is just a matter
of time before all our horses are infected with the same
disease," he said.
</P>
<P>
"My staff, myself and my owners, we live for the spring carnival.
It's the two or three months of the year where that's what's it's
about, being involved in the racing industry.
</P>
<P>
"That's now been taken away from us and it's horribly unlikely
that we'll be back racing in the next two to three months."
</P>
<P>
There have even been reports that race organisers could saddle up
camels or hold phantom meetings without spectators in a bid to
satisfy punters unable to place a bet because of the ban.
