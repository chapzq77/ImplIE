Anglophiles Rejoice: Here Comes an Invasion of British Cookbooks
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fat Duck chef Heston Blumenthal's highly anticipated "The Big Fat
Duck Cookbook" will be available simultaneously in the United
States and the UK in October. The U.S. versions of Anna Del
Conte's "The Painter, the Cook and the Art of Cucina" and Jamie
Oliver's "Jamie at Home" also come out this fall. And last year
saw the American edition of the much-lauded "Roast Chicken and
Other Stories" by Simon Hopkinson. (And his new "Week In Week
Out" was published this year across the pond).

A list of notables:
</P>
<P>
-- "The Big Fat Duck Cookbook" by Heston Blumenthal. This is Fat
Duck chef Blumenthal's coming showstopper of a cookbook -- with
gorgeous photos (of dishes such as nitro-poached green tea and
lime mousse), cloth binding and slip case (multiple ribbons too).
It's divided into three sections: history (the restaurant's rise
to three Michelin stars), recipes (for example, sardine-on-toast
sorbet and chocolate wine), and science (experts talk about
synaesthesia). Coming in October, Bloomsbury Publishing.
</P>
<P>
--"Jamie's Ministry of Food: Anyone Can Learn to Cook in 24
Hours" by Jamie Oliver. Fun-loving chef-personality Oliver has
been prolific. On the heels of the coming U.S. edition of "Jamie
at Home: Cook Your Way to the Good Life" this fall (published in
the UK last September and which follows the U.S. version of
"Cooking With Jamie: My Guide to Making You a Better Cook"),
comes "Ministry of Food," to persuade those who are kitchen-shy
"to have a go." October, Michael Joseph Ltd. Import.
</P>
<P>
--"My Favourite Ingredients" by Skye Gyngell. Australian food
writer and head chef at the Petersham Nurseries Cafe in Richmond,
Surrey, comes out with her second cookbook (following "A Year in
My Kitchen"), highlighting seasonal ingredients in recipes such
as raw white asparagus with porcini, roasted hazelnuts and
Parmesan; and "fritto misto" of artichokes with lemon, mint and
anchovy vinaigrette. August, Quadrille Publishing. Import.
</P>
<P>
--"The River Cottage Cookbook" by Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall.
Published in the United States in May by Ten Speed Press, this is
the American edition of a book that outlines the pastoral ideal
of cooking, one that involves supporting the environment and
local economies, even if you don't happen to grow your own fruit
and vegetables and slaughter your own animals. Fearnley-
Whittingstall (a celebrity via his BBC television shows) also
tells you how to pick a perfect mushroom or how to make nettle
soup.
</P>
<P>
--"Gordon Ramsay's Healthy Appetite" by Gordon Ramsay. In between
shooting "Hell's Kitchen" and expanding his restaurant empire,
Ramsay brought out his latest cookbook, published in May by
Quadrille, right after "Gordon Ramsay: Recipes From a 3-Star
Chef" and "Gordon Ramsay's Fast Food." This one's for calorie
counters and the like. Think rump of lamb with Puy lentils,
saffron-marinated bream, or turkey brochettes. Import.
</P>
<P>
--"Ottolenghi: The Cookbook" by Yotam Ottolenghi and Sami Tamimi.
The Ottolenghi shops in London are filled with bright, modern,
mostly eastern Mediterranean dishes --" mejadarah" (spiced
basmati rice and brown lentils with fried onions) or baked
sardines with bulgur, "Iranian berries" and pomegranate. The
book, published in May by Ebury Press, has 140 recipes: salad and
roast vegetable dishes, cold meats and fish, main dishes, breads
and sweets (such as the pistachio meringues that are displayed in
their windows). Import.
</P>
<P>
--"Breakfast at the Wolseley" by A. A. Gill. London's swells do
breakfast at the Wolseley -- all high ceilings and fancy
silverware -- tucking into fried duck eggs with Ayrshire bacon,
boiled eggs with soldiers, grilled Manx kippers with mustard
butter. In this book published in May by Quadrille, novelist Gill
(who also has written portraits of other restaurants) gives
history, behind-the-scenes accounts and recipes. Import.
</P>
<P>
--"Maze: The Cookbook" by Jason Atherton. Atherton is executive
chef at Maze (part of Ramsay's empire) in London, and he has just
launched steakhouse Maze Grill next door. Each of his Maze
recipes -- braised shin of veal with pea risotto or butter-
roasted cod with silky mash and spiced lentils -- is followed by
two more that are based on the same ingredients and geared to the
home cook. Published in April by Quadrille. Import.
</P>
<P>
--"One Perfect Ingredient, Three Ways to Cook It" by Marcus
Wareing. The name says it all. Celebrity chef Wareing (who riffs
off of his book, "How to Cook the Perfect ... ") gives three
recipes for 50 ingredients in this Dorling Kindersley book
published in March. Take bananas -- for a baked pudding, caramel
Bavarois or banana fritters. Import.
</P>
<P>
--"The Painter, the Cook and the Art of Cucina" by Anna Del
Conte. Puglia, Le Marche, Piedmont, Sardinia ... Italian culinary
writer  Del Conte covers the less-traveled regions of Italy. The
book, which includes 100 oil paintings by Val Archer, guides the
reader through local food customs and regional dishes. Published
last October by Conran Octopus, the book will be available in a
U.S. version this fall.
</P>
<P>
--"Week In Week Out" by Simon Hopkinson. Last fall, Quadrille
published a collection of weekly columns that ran in the
Independent, written by Hopkinson, author of foodie favorite
"Roast Chicken and Other Stories." Each week he focuses on a
particular ingredient, dish or meal and writes recipes according
to the season. For summer? Say, broad beans with cream and mint.
Import. ("Second Helpings of Roast Chicken" will be published in
the U.S. this fall.)
</P>
<P>
--"Moro East" by Samantha Clark and Samuel Clark. This autumn
2007 cookbook, published by Ebury Press, is the third from the
chef couple at Moro restaurant in London, and it's filled with
inspiring ingredient and flavor combinations influenced by the
cuisines of Spain and North Africa: "cacik," a chilled soup made
with cucumber, yogurt, mint and pine nuts; chicken with spring
garlic and Pedro Ximenez sherry; and grilled sardines with fennel
and chiles. Import.
</P>
<P>
--"Beyond Nose to Tail: A Kind of British Cooking Part II" by
Fergus Henderson. A decade of offal trendiness probably started
with Henderson, proprietor of St. John in London, a chef's chef
known for ingeniously using every part of the pig but the oink.
This August 2007 book from Bloomsbury Publishing is an expansion
of his "Nose to Tail Eating." He calls for some challenging
ingredients (pig's spleen), but some recipes are more accessible,
as in mussels grilled on a barbecue or St. John's Eccles cake.
