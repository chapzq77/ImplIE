Baseball: Johnson, Jeter to lead US in World Baseball Classic
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
New York Yankees star Derek Jeter and Beijing Olympics US team
manager Davey Johnson were named on Wednesday to the US squad
that will try to redeem American honor in the World Baseball
Classic.
</P>
<P>
Johnson will serve as manager of the US collection of Major
League Baseball stars while Jeter was named a shortstop of a team
that next March will try to improve upon a second-round ouster in
the inaugural 2006 edition of the event.
</P>
<P>
"It seems like there's much more interest (from US players) this
time, more interest in being on that team," Johnson said.
"There's payback to do."
</P>
<P>
Jeter could wind up seeing a familiar face against him in the
global showdown as Yankee teammate Alex Rodriguez has said he
will play for the Dominican Republic this time rather than the US
team as he did in 2006.
</P>
<P>
"I think everyone is pretty excited about this," Jeter said.
"When the Classic started there was a lot of skepticism. No one
knew if it was going to work.
</P>
<P>
"When we got on the field we were excited to represent our
country. There's a lot of pride here."
</P>
<P>
The Americans were eliminated on a tie-breaker last time in a
round-robin format, allowing Japan and South Korea to advance
from their second-round group to the semi-finals.
</P>
<P>
Japan went on to defeat Cuba in the final as the first global
showdown with elite Major League Baseball talent featured only
two major leaguers in the title matchup, a sign of global
strength and a wake-up call for US stars.
</P>
<P>
"We're very excited about the World Baseball Classic," Major
League Baseball president Bob DuPuy said. "Some of the players
were sceptical but given what transpired and the boost it gave
the game, they were all very supportive.
</P>
<P>
"That's particularly important given the absence of baseball in
the 2012 Olympics."
</P>
<P>
Baseball was voted out by the International Olympic Committee
(IOC), in part because the US league would not shut down for the
Games and instead established the Classic as its sport's global
showcase.
</P>
<P>
"Before too long, before the next decade is out, this will be
regarded as the equal of any international sporting event in the
world," Major League Baseball Players Association boss Don Fehr
said.
</P>
<P>
Harvey Schiller, president of the International Baseball
Federation, said the 2009 event might help convince the IOC to
reinstate the sport next October when it meets to consider the
2016 Olympic host and sporting lineup.
</P>
<P>
"We believe it will help us to return to the 2016 Olympic Games
in London," Schiller said.
</P>
<P>
The same 16 nations as in the 2006 debut will return next March
with China, Japan, Taiwan and South Korea starting March 5 in a
first-round group at Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
Other first-round sites find the US, Canada, Italy and Venezuela
at Toronto; Australia, South Africa, Mexico and Cuba at Mexico
City and Panama, Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico and Netherlands
at San Juan, Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
Second-round games will be at San Diego and Miami with the semi-
final and title games March 21-23 at Dodger Stadium in Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
The first two rounds will each be played as a double-elimination
tournament, avoiding a tie-breaker headache that led to the 2006
US ouster.
</P>
<P>
Provisional rosters will be entered on January 19 with final
rosters set on February 24, with limits on how many players major
league clubs can lose at a time when they will be preparing for
early April season openers.
</P>
<P>
Classic clubs will play major league teams in exhibitions and
pitchers will have limits on throws in a game and mandatory rest
time between appearances so they are not overworked before the
start of the US season.
</P>
<P>
US government approval will be needed to allow Cuban players into
US venues because of their diplomatic disagreements.
</P>
<P>
"That is pending and we anticipate approval of that application
very soon," said Doyle Pryor, assistant general counsel for the
players union.
</P>
<P>
The event offers 14 million dollars in prize money, much of which
will go to helping boost the game's global growth.
