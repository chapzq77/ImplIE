Argentina ' s credit rating lowered amid strife

BUENOS AIRES, Argentina 2008-10-31 17:40:26 UTC

<P>
The "deteriorating" economic and political climate in Argentina
prompted Standard &amp; Poor's Ratings Services on Friday to
lower the country's debt ratings to six levels below investment
grade.
</P>
<P>
The ratings company lowered Argentina's foreign and local
currency sovereign credit ratings to 'B-' from 'B,' which
translates into a heightened risk for those who want to put their
capital in the country and an increasing probability of default
for the South American country.
</P>
<P>
The company attributed the downgrade in part to last week's
government proposal to nationalize private pension funds, which
has greatly spooked investors, sending overall confidence in the
local markets into a tailspin.
</P>
<P>
The global crisis drove Argentina's benchmark Merval stock index
down 44 percent between July 1 and the beginning of last week.
The Merval plummeted 20 percent more -- its lowest level in four
years -- after President Cristina Fernandez proposed the state
takeover.
</P>
<P>
The index has since rebounded slightly, but analysts attribute
the recuperation to favorable investment decisions in the U.S.
and Europe, rather than domestic measures.
</P>
<P>
Friday's cut is the second issued by S&amp;P in less than three
months.
</P>
<P>
"The downgrade reflects our heightened concerns about the
deteriorating economic and political environment in Argentina and
the resulting increased fiscal stress," analyst David Beers said
in a statement issued by the company Friday morning from London.
</P>
<P>
The outlook remains stable, however, since the government still
has a "financing cushion," Beers said, including nearly $47
billion in federal reserves as of Oct. 17.
</P>
<P>
He predicted the financial crisis would curtail demand, keeping
commodity prices low and producing a sharp drop in Argentina's
economic growth. The agricultural powerhouse is one of the
world's top grain and beef exporters.
</P>
<P>
Slower growth will make it increasingly difficult for the
government to service $28 billion in debt, which comes due over
the next three years. The government's financing problems have
been exacerbated by a virtual lockout from the international
credit market after the country defaulted on US$95 billion in
2001 -- the largest amount in history.
</P>
<P>
S&amp;P's and Moody's Investor Services -- another top ratings
agency -- issued harsh assessments of Argentine risk in mid-
August amid concerns that slowing growth, soaring prices and
steep public spending would keep the government from servicing
its debt.
</P>
<P>
Moody's will not lower its current B3 rating, which already is
six levels below investment grade and represents a great risk of
default, Gabriel Torres, a senior analyst for Moody's in New York
told The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
"Countries in the B category are countries that we describe as
being one shock away from default," Torres said.
</P>
<P>
Argentina has found a "natural" -- if high-risk -- floor, and is
not on the brink of default yet, he said.
</P>
<P>
The rating puts Argentina on par with Bolivia, Paraguay and
Ecuador in the region.
</P>
<P>
"This rating cut reflects the increased uncertainty the Argentine
economy is facing," said economist Carolina Schuff, an analyst
with the Buenos Aires-based economic Web site abeceb.com, adding
she was not surprised by the cut.
</P>
<P>
The international financial uncertainty facing Argentina has been
exacerbated by domestic decisions like the government's recent
proposal to grab private pension funds, she said.
</P>
<P>
"They're constantly changing the rules, and many investments are
long term, requiring foresight," which the government's surprise
announcement doesn't provide, Schuff said.
