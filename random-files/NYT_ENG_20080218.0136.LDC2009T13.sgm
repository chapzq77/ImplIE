LITTLE DETAILS BOOST WEDDING GIRL ' S STYLE WALKING DOWN THE
AISLE
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There are some things that a girl just can't get along without on
the big day. But even the necessities can be made nice:
</P>
<P>
-- Specs
</P>
<P>
Those funky, chunky black specs that define you as a cultural
creative in the office might be a bit too jarring for your
wedding get-up. If you need eyeglasses, are disinclined to wear
contact lenses and think prenuptial vision correction surgery
falls into the category of budget-buster, think about picking out
some special frames for the big day.
</P>
<P>
Heidi Tanner, manager of DisRespectacles in Denver, says some
women can pull off an over-the-top frame, but she typically
steers brides-to-be toward frames that are "a little more
minimal, softer and feminine."
</P>
<P>
Pick from a lineup of new jeweled frames, or select a vintage
frame.
</P>
<P>
Among Tanner's favorites at the moment is a white Vivia frame,
studded with silver sparkles, handmade in France by Francis
Klein. They run about $515, not including lenses.
</P>
<P>
Vintage frames are less expensive, averaging around $125 in the
eyeglasses store, and are way less expensive if you shop at
garage sales or thrift stores.
</P>
<P>
Expect to spend about $160 for lenses. And, yes, you do need the
anti-reflective coatings -- you don't want flash photography to
bounce off your glasses.
</P>
<P>
Getting your frames fit with new lenses can be done pretty
quickly, but Tanner recommends getting the work done a few weeks
in advance, just to be on the safe side.
</P>
<P>
Tip: Old frames can be very fragile, so if you've chosen vintage
frames, select an optician who has experience with old specs and
will handle your glasses with lots of TLC.
</P>
<P>
-- Hair
</P>
<P>
Whether you're veiling up or approaching your vows bareheaded,
chances are good you'll want some kind of hair ornament, possibly
including fresh blooms.
</P>
<P>
If you're thinking of adding flowers to your 'do, make sure to do
a trial run with the hairstylist.
</P>
<P>
If you have very short hair and don't plan to have a pro help
with styling, a trial run is especially critical.
</P>
<P>
"You can definitely overwhelm yourself with flowers," says Teresa
Henry, owner of Boulder Blooms, a top wedding-flower design
studio in Boulder, Colo. "If the bride will do the whole trial
run thing, with the hairstylist, and hairpiece, they know exactly
what they're getting."
</P>
<P>
If a test run isn't in the budget, spend time going over -- in
excruciating detail -- what you want from a headpiece.
</P>
<P>
Henry says she also tries to develop combs and pins that can be
placed in the bride's 'do right before the ceremony or pictures.
</P>
<P>
"We try to design it in a way that can be placed on styled hair
right at the end," she says. "Freshness is always an issue when
you're working in heat and sun."
</P>
<P>
Tip: Don't get hung up on a particular bloom until you talk to a
florist. The flowers you fell in love with in pictures taken for
bridal magazines might not survive in searing summer heat.
</P>
<P>
-- Jewelry
</P>
<P>
So you've pored over grandma's jewelry box and picked the perfect
piece to wear on your wedding day but realize that clip-on
earrings make your lobes throb or the necklace dips too deeply
into your d?colletage. What to do? See a custom jeweler.
</P>
<P>
Colin Miller, production manager at Master Goldsmith in Boulder,
says that if your vintage piece is a good quality metal, fixing
its style flaws is relatively simple.
</P>
<P>
And don't be afraid to ask for help with costume jewelry. Some
old costume pieces are very high quality, and the technology that
jewelers use today -- such as laser welding tools -- make changes
less risky.
</P>
<P>
Miller likes working with vintage pieces because he gets to see
work from other eras and other cultures. He recently restored a
jeweled, gold-filled locket for a client. "It was not special in
terms of materials, but it was very sentimental."
</P>
<P>
Converting clip-ons to posts starts at about $50; completely
restyling a piece can go sky high. Miller advises not leaving the
work until the last minute -- he likes to have two weeks for most
projects.
</P>
<P>
Tip: Worried that your yellow gold vintage jewelry or "something
borrowed" will clash with the silver beads on your dress? Denise
Snyder, owner of Mariel in Denver, says the jewelry can be
"dipped" to change its color and then dipped back to its original
color.
</P>
<P>
-- Shoes
</P>
<P>
Unless you're exchanging vows on the beach, you're going to need
shoes. And news flash, ladies, there's no reason they have to be
ugly or uncomfortable.
</P>
<P>
"I tell brides all the time that it's fun to have a shoe that is
not one of those dye-able, icky satin wedding shoes that are
going to sit in your closet until you give them away," says Elyse
Burja, who owns Strut in Denver. "Get a pair you love."
</P>
<P>
For her own wedding last year, Burja wore a patent- leather-
covered wedge with a snake upper in off-white. If she had it to
do again this year, she'd pick the gold "Linda" open-toed pump
from Blay.
</P>
<P>
When you're shopping, keep comfort in mind, she says. "If you're
looking at something that's super strappy, the shoe might be
gorgeous, but you might also be tortured and that's not fun.
There's a good in-between out there -- gorgeous and remotely
comfortable."
</P>
<P>
Tip: Don't be afraid to buy a half-size up and use shoe pads to
cushion the ball of your foot.
