Neteller founder pleads guilty in online gambling case in New
York

NEW YORK 2007-06-30 05:58:38 UTC
</P>
<P>
The co-founder of Neteller, a company based in Britain that
processed billions of dollars in Internet gambling transactions
for Americans, has pleaded guilty to a charge of criminal
conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
Stephen Lawrence, whose company, Neteller PLC, was once one of
the primary ways U.S. citizens placed bets with offshore bookies,
acknowledged in a federal courtroom in Manhattan that the
operation was illegal.
</P>
<P>
"I came to understand that providing payment services to online
gambling Web sites serving customers in the United States was
wrong," he told the judge Friday.
</P>
<P>
His lawyers said he was cooperating with U.S. investigators and
also had agreed to be at least partly responsible for the $100
million (euro74.05 million) the government is seeking in
restitution.
</P>
<P>
Lawrence and another Neteller director, John David Lefebvre, were
arrested in January as part of a U.S. crackdown on the online
gambling industry.
</P>
<P>
Both men are Canadian citizens. Their company was based in the
Isle of Man and traded on the London Stock Exchange. Some experts
initially believed that Neteller's offshore status put it beyond
the reach of U.S. law.
</P>
<P>
The company also was not directly involved in either placing or
receiving bets. It essentially served as a financial middleman,
through which bettors could send and receive cash from Web-based
operations located in countries with few restrictions on
gambling.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors read U.S. law differently, and charged Lawrence with
violating decades-old acts prohibiting the use of electronic
wires to send or receive information that facilitates illegal
gambling.
</P>
<P>
Lawrence, who remains free on $5 million (euro3.7 million) bail,
declined to speak to reporters as he left the courtroom Friday.
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Lawrence is very glad to have this episode over and is
looking forward to moving on to the next stage in his life," said
his attorney, Peter Neiman. He said Lawrence intended to return
to his home in the Bahamas until his sentencing, which has been
scheduled for October.
</P>
<P>
It was not immediately clear whether Lawrence will face prison
time. He faced a statutory maximum of five years, but any
punishment is likely to be reduced by his cooperation in the
case.
</P>
<P>
The case against Lefebvre, who pleaded not guilty, is pending.
</P>
<P>
Neteller stopped processing gambling transactions for U.S.
customers within days of Lawrence's arrest in January, ending a
brief period in which it had soared to the top of the cottage
industry that helps Americans wager billions of dollars a year
online.
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1999, the company grew fast as spooked credit card
companies, worried about legal liability, stopped doing business
with offshore gambling operations.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors said Neteller processed $5.1 billion worth of
transactions in the first half of 2006. Nearly all involved
online gambling. A majority of the company's revenue came from
customers in the U.S., and the FBI began looking at its
operations in June 2006.
</P>
<P>
Lawrence, at one point, was the company's largest shareholder.
Both he and Lefebvre have since left the company's board of
directors.
</P>
<P>
Lawrence and Lefebvre are among a group of businessmen linked to
online gambling who have faced U.S. charges.
</P>
<P>
Stephen Kaplan, the founder of the London-based bookmaker
BetOnSports PLC, was indicted on racketeering charges in St.
Louis. He and the company's chief executive, David Carruthers,
are awaiting trial.
</P>
<P>
The chairman of Sportingbet PLC was detained briefly last year in
New York after he was indicted on online gambling charges in
Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Congress last year also enacted new regulations further
barring banks and credit card companies from processing online
gambling payments.
</P>
<P>
The crackdown has not sat well abroad.
</P>
<P>
The World Trade Organization ruled in December that the law is
unfair to offshore casinos.
</P>
<P>
The Caribbean nation of Antigua and Barbuda, a home to online
gambling businesses, demanded this month that the U.S. pay $3.4
billion (euro2.5 billion) in sanctions each year for failing to
comply with the ruling. Protests also have been made by the
European Union, Japan and India.
