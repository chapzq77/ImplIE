Israel to launch Olmert corruption probe: TV
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A criminal investigation is to be opened into Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Olmert's alleged abuse of influence while he was
acting finance minister, Israel's Channel 10 reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Attorney General Menahem Mazuz is expected to announce the probe
into the allegations involving a bank privatisation in the coming
days after Olmert returns from an official visit to China, the
channel said.
</P>
<P>
It was not immediately possible to confirm the report with Mazuz.
</P>
<P>
Israeli police in October opened a "preliminary investigation"
into Olmert's activities during the 2004 privatisation of Leumi
Bank, Israel's second largest.
</P>
<P>
That followed a recommendation by State Comptroller Micha
Lindenstrauss -- empowered by the Knesset, or national assembly,
to review government policies and operations -- for Mazuz to open
a criminal investigation into the affair.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister is suspected of intervening, while acting
finance minister, on behalf of businessman Frank Lowy, who was
attempting to secure an interest in the bank.
</P>
<P>
The bank was finally sold to another company with no relation to
Lowry.
</P>
<P>
Olmert was involved in several corruption investigations last
year, although no formal charges have been filed against him.
</P>
<P>
Among them are several property deals and appointments made while
trade and industry minister in his predecessor Ariel Sharon's
government.
