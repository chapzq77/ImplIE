British union demands talks with Tata amid plan to revamp Corus
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Britain's largest steel trade union has demanded a meeting with
Indian tycoon Ratan Tata, seeking assurances he will remain
committed to expanding Corus Group Plc after his winning 13.7
billion dollar bid for the Anglo-Dutch steelmaker.
</P>
<P>
Community, which describes itself as the dominant union in Corus
representing 80 percent of its UK employees, also sought British
government backing for the steel industry's attempt to ward off
"accelerated or slow demise" and protect jobs.
</P>
<P>
"Community shall be seeking talks with Tata to discuss its
investment strategy for the Corus business, in particular its UK
operations," said Michael Leahy, Community general secretary, in
a statement posted on the web site www .community-tu.org/ter on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Tata Steel, the flagship company of the Tata business empire, is
set to become the world's fifth-largest steelmaker, vaulting from
56th place, after beating Brazilian rival CSN on Wednesday in a
bidding contest for Corus.
</P>
<P>
The combined entity will have annual output of around 25 million
tonnes and more than 87,000 employees.
</P>
<P>
Unions are concerned about possible job losses in a company where
8,000 people were thrown out of work in the past eight years,
India's Business Standard newspaper reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
"This acquisition is not about job cuts," Tata Steel managing
director B. Muthuraman said, adding in the same breath that no
one in the world can really consider his job secure.
</P>
<P>
Corus, which was spawned by the 1999 merger of Dutch firm
Hoogovens and British Steel, employs 47,300 people globally,
including 24,000 in Britain and 11,400 in the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
It is Europe's second-largest steel maker and the world's ninth-
largest, producing around 18 million tonnes per year.
</P>
<P>
Tata Steel employed about 39,650 people as of March 2005,
according to the company's latest corporate sustainability
report. It is the biggest private steel firm in India.
</P>
<P>
"If this bid is accepted by shareholders, then Tata will be
inheriting a profitable, well-run company with, in the case of
its UK operations, some of the most efficient steelworkers in the
world," Leahy said.
</P>
<P>
"What I can say at this point is that we are willing to working
in partnership to drive forward an investment strategy that will
allow the UK operations to contribute further to the
profitability of Tata," he said.
</P>
<P>
"However, what we are not prepared to accept is the accelerated
or slow demise of the UK steel industry.
</P>
<P>
"Tata should be under no illusions that we will resist any
attempt to achieve this, using all the resources at our
disposal."
</P>
<P>
The union put Tata on notice amid concerns of possible job cuts
following the takeover, the biggest acquisition by an Indian
company. Tata Steel shares tumbled about 13 percent in the past
two days on concern Tata is paying too high a price.
</P>
<P>
The Indian firm, part of the wider Tata group that includes a
wide range of business interests from tea to software to
automobiles, has 3.8 billion dollars in annual turnover while
Corus has 18 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Tata predicted that a combination with Corus would create a high
quality, low- cost growth platform in Asia combined with a
leading European steel player.
</P>
<P>
Ratan Tata, 68, will be named chairman of the Corus board in a
management revamp once the takeover is completed, the Hindustan
Times reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Corus chairman Jim Leng will be deputy chairman and serve as a
director on the Tata Steel board.
