GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP)
</P>
<P>
In an unprecedented move, the Palestinian Authority on Thursday placed
the leader of the Islamic militant group Hamas under house arrest.
</P>
<P>
The decision came several hours after Hamas claimed responsibility for
a suicide bombing that killed an Israeli soldier and threatened to
undermine the new Mideast peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
In response to the attack, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat promised
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that he would crack down on
the militants.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian policemen set up roadblocks around Sheik Ahmed Yassin's
home. Motorists were stopped and questioned. Policemen opened trunks
and aimed flashlights at passengers.
</P>
<P>
Journalists were told they could stick around for a few minutes to
take in the scene, but would then have to leave.
</P>
<P>
``Sheik Ahmed Yassin is under house arrest for security reasons,'' the
Palestinian security services announced.
</P>
<P>
It marked Arafat's first open confrontation with the quadriplegic
Hamas leader, his strongest political rival.
</P>
<P>
In the past, the Palestinian leader has detained lower-level Hamas
officials from time to time. However, he never touched Yassin,
apparently because he wanted to avoid an open and possibly bloody
showdown with the militants.
</P>
<P>
A relative of Yassin told The Associated Press by telephone that the
Hamas leader had not been notified that he was barred from leaving his
home. The man said Yassin's first appointment outside his home was
Friday morning and that he had not planned to go out before then.
</P>
<P>
Arafat also ordered the arrests of dozens of Hamas activists. Two
senior members, Mahmoud Zahar, and Ismail Hanieh, were among those
detained.
