A 40-year-old convicted of orchestrating and participating in the
fatal stabbing and beating of a man during a 1995 robbery was
executed by lethal injection Thursday in the state of Texas,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
Larry Davis was put to death at Huntsville Prison at 6:19 pm
local time (2319 GMT), a representative of the Texas Department
of Criminal Justice told AFP.
</P>
<P>
Davis was accused of entering the Amarillo, Texas home of Michael
Barrow with several conspirators and killing Barrow, who was
stabbed with a knife and an ice pick and beaten with a pipe.
</P>
<P>
Davis had proclaimed he was innocent of planning and carrying out
the murder.
</P>
<P>
The execution is the third in July in the state of Texas, and the
16th in the United States since the Supreme Court in April ruled
that lethal injections are constitutional. Executions across the
country had been put on hold for months as the court deliberated.
</P>
<P>
According to the Death Penalty Information Center, 16 executions
are expected between now and September, including 10 more in
Texas, the state that has put a record 409 people to death in the
past 30 years.
