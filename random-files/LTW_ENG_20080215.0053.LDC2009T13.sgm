Fanning the Flames of Tradition

LOS ANGELES
</P>
<P>
Cars, bank notes and TVs were going up in flames one chilly
winter morning in the parking lot of Universal Chung Wah Funeral
Home in Alhambra, 10 miles east of downtown Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
Thirteen white-clad relatives of Dam Lam, 87, formed a circle,
each cradling a stack of paper models: a foot-long 747 jetliner,
a black-and-gold car sitting in the courtyard of a 2-foot-tall,
red-tiled paper mansion. One by one, the items were thrown into
the fire licking out of a 4-by-4-foot wheeled container, charred
from years of use.
</P>
<P>
Lam would need the items in heaven, his family said.
</P>
<P>
Chinese mourners have been burning funeral paper -- known as joss
paper, or dzi-dzat -- for centuries. Traditionally, stacks of
bamboo or rice paper bank notes were burned in braziers before
the body of the deceased was lowered into the ground.
</P>
<P>
Practitioners of the ritual, derived  from a mix of Taoism,
Buddhism and regional folklore, believe that burning paper money
equates to making advance deposits into an afterlife bank account
that the deceased's spirit can access in heaven.
</P>
<P>
Sales usually  jump around Chinese New Year. Shops also offer
deep discounts during Ghost Month, often referred to as the
Chinese version of Halloween, which this year begins Aug. 1. Many
believe that spirits spend the month sniffing for souls to take,
prompting the superstitious to crowd dzi-dzat stores looking for
offerings to appease dead relatives.
</P>
<P>
Demand for increasingly extravagant dzi-dzat models is booming in
Asia and in Southern California's large Chinese community, fueled
by devoted family members who regularly burn care packages on
festival days, birthdays -- even the day after they dream about
the deceased.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese immigrants who arrived in the U.S. between the 1950s
and the 1970s are beginning to die, and their relatives are
flocking to funeral homes to brush up on the ritual.
</P>
<P>
"For some people who cannot buy the actual items, they pursue the
desire in the paper-goods form," said Xin Zhao, a professor of
international marketing at the University of Hawaii. "It's like
vicariously having them."
</P>
<P>
Lately, Southern California Chinese have become  very particular
about what they take to heaven, opting for fashionable upgrades
of older dzi-dzat models, funeral workers said. Which explains
the paper cell phones, paper DVD players, paper jewelry and
clothing. It also explains why mourners purchase paper laptops:
so their dead  kin can keep track of the paper credit cards that
came with them.
</P>
<P>
At Lam's funeral in December, several paper cars, including a
gray sedan with a red-jacketed chauffeur behind the plastic
windshield, were parked on the altar amid mounds of pears, apples
and pomelo.
</P>
<P>
Lam was a simple man with a gentle soul, according to his son,
Konn Lam, 37. Born in Guangzhou, China, he got married in
Vietnam, raised his four children in Hong Kong and moved to
Alhambra in the 1980s. He made some money in the import-export
business but also endured some financial difficulties. Now, Lam's
family wanted to give him all the luxuries that eluded him in
life.
</P>
<P>
Before relatives stepped outside the funeral home to burn the
paper offerings, Buddhist monks chanted sutras to allow Lam to
travel peacefully to Buddha's world. White flowers framed a large
photo of Lam on an altar, which about 25 mourners approached with
incense sticks, bowing as the sutras continued playing over
speakers.
</P>
<P>
Smoke from incense sticks curled under the gold and silver paper
bridges that Lam's spirit was expected to cross, near a golden
servant boy and a silver servant girl. Strips of yellow paper
listing Lam's name and the date of the ceremony hung from each
offering, like a letter to be sent to an afterlife address.
</P>
<P>
Outside, during the burning, two attendants chanted Lam's name
after each toss, also reciting the name of the object and a short
verse symbolically delivering the goods into the afterlife.
</P>
<P>
Within minutes, the intricate models settled into ash. The
mourners bowed three times toward the bin, then went back inside
to finish the funeral.
</P>
<P>
Paper funeral goods can be found in Los Angeles' Chinatown, as
well as in Chinese enclaves in the area.
</P>
<P>
A wide variety of paper goods -- kitchen utensils, trendy paper
pumps -- are strung up like pinatas over spreads of candles and
religious figurines. Red-wrapped boxes of paper dim-sum dumplings
crowd shelves next to a paper rice cooker with a removable lid
and treasure boxes brimming with paper playing cards.
</P>
<P>
In one corner of the Commonwealth Trading Co. in Chinatown, near
a paper bathroom scale shrouded in plastic, the screen of a boxy
gray paper TV with a "multi-system Penesonic" label shows a
printed panorama of an Asian city. Perched nearby, a papier-mache
tabby with plastic whiskers and a lush coat of paper strips
glares through beaded eyes at a paper microwave. Owner Carol
Kwan, 42, drifted among her clientele -- mostly middle-aged women
chattering in Cantonese -- as she pointed out a hollow $25
"Afterlife Airlines" airplane emblazoned with a blue phoenix
emblem. The paper products usually cost between $5 and $30, she
said.
</P>
<P>
In the back of a dark shelf in Kwan's shop, a bulky blue paper
land-line phone with a removable receiver collects dust. A more
prominently displayed set features a sleek black cell phone with
a "Moropalo" sticker that is similar to Motorola's logo. The pack
also includes paper batteries, a charger and a pager with lucky
6's and 8's splashed across the screen.
</P>

Kwan started receiving custom requests: a paper wheelchair for
someone who was disabled, paper fishing poles for an avid fly-
fisher. And, appropriately for car-crazed Los Angeles, Kwan is
often asked for a specific paper Honda model with silver rims, or
a BMW in a particular color.
</P>
<P>
She usually rejects individualized requests because the range of
paper materials needed to construct models is limited in the
U.S., as is  the pool of qualified artisans, she
said.Occasionally, Kwan takes orders for specialized paper houses
and contracts them out, but because each house takes 14 days to
make and costs at least $500, those requests are rare.

Mourners in Asia certainly have no problem burning -- literally
-- through money. In affluent Hong Kong, Guangzhou and Macau,
they want their dead to live a good afterlife, sending lavish
models of paper villas with manicured gardens, cutouts of
security guards and full-size replicas of BMW motorcycles up in
flames.
</P>
<P>
And although China's economic renaissance has softened most
regional authorities toward the ritual, burning paper replicas is
still officially banned in most of the country.Communist ideology
does not recognize filial piety and life after death. The  air
pollution from burning paper also don't help, said Zhao, the
professor.
</P>
<P>
The Communist government has also commented on what it views as
inappropriate items for burning. Apparently the afterlife has a
booming red-light district. In April 2006, China's deputy
secretary of the Ministry of Civil Affairs prohibited the burning
of "adult" items such as paper condoms, karaoke hostesses and
Viagra.
</P>
<P>
U.S. funeral directors and merchants predict the ritual is headed
for a downturn, however, as the community becomes more
assimilated. Younger, American-born Chinese avoid Kwan's shop,
she said, because many do not understand the paper-burning
tradition.
</P>
<P>
"Even though Chinese people are willing to pay more for funerals,
I'm worried that fewer people will be buying the paper goods,"
she said. "People born here just don't believe."
