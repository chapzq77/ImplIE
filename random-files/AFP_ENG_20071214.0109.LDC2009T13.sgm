UN climate talks break for night

Marathon talks on fighting climate change took a break early
Saturday, with delegates saying they were hopeful for an
agreement but that some issues remained undecided, officials
said."You can go to bed and come back to the plenary tomorrow
morning," said Artur Runge-Metzger, a climate negotiator of the
European Commission.
</P>
<P>
A British official said: "The negotiations are ongoing. Nothing
is in and nothing is out."
</P>
<P>
Delegates said one key sticking point was a US-led call on
developing countries to commit to slashing carbon emissions.
</P>
<P>
"The US is demanding that developing countries make the same
obligations as the industrialised countries," German Environment
Minister Sigmar Gabriel said.
</P>
<P>
"The developing countries are prepared to do more, but don't want
to be put into the same category as the industrialised
countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
The United States is the only major industrial country to reject
the Kyoto Protocol, with President George W. Bush arguing it is
unfair by not making demands of fast-growing developing economies
such as China, the second biggest emitter.
</P>
<P>
Despite the disagreement, UN climate chief Yvo de Boer said
earlier he was hopeful for a breakthrough as most of the
difficult issues had been worked out.
</P>
<P>
The agreement is expected to make a general call for rich nations
to slash emissions of carbon blamed for causing global warming,
which a Nobel-winning panel of scientists predicts could
devastate the world in decades to come.
