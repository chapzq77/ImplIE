Vietnam and North Korea Saturday signed agreements on sharing
agricultural technology and cultural exchanges during a meeting
between their prime ministers Nguyen Tan Dung and Kim Yong-Il.
</P>
<P>
Kim arrived in Hanoi on Friday for a five-day official visit to
Pyongyang's ideological ally, which comes just after Vietnamese
Communist Party leader Nong Duc Manh's trip to North Korea.
</P>
<P>
Hanoi and Pyongyang would "exchange candid views on the matters
of further strengthening and developing bilateral relations as
well as other issues of mutual concern," the North Korean
delegation said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
It stressed that the two countries had "a long history and
excellent tradition of friendship and cooperation with each
other."
</P>
<P>
The Vietnamese army paper Quan Doi Nhan Dan said Kim's visit
"demonstrates the wish to give a boost to cooperation between the
two countries."
</P>
<P>
Vietnam, which has just taken its seat as a non-permanent member
of the UN Security Council, is seeking to strengthen its
political role on the international stage.
</P>
<P>
The official Vietnam News Agency said the visit by Nong Duc Manh
to Pyongyang had already demonstrated Hanoi's wish to take part
in "promoting peace on the Korean Peninsula."
</P>
<P>
Vietnam and North Korea, which have both fought against the
United States, remain allies in politics and ideology.
</P>
<P>
But South Korea has become a leading foreign investor in Vietnam,
which opened up to the world in 1986 and since then has seen
speedy economic growth and international integration.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, the North Korean prime minister is due to visit
the Ha Tu coal mines in the northeast of the country, where he is
also expected to go to the scenic tourist spot of Halong Bay.
</P>
<P>
Kim is due Monday to visit an agricultural research institute
near Hanoi and on Tuesday go to the Cu Chi tunnel near Ho Chi
Minh City which was the bastion of the communist forces during
the Vietnam War.
