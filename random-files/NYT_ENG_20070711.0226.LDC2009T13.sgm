VENEZUELA'S AMBASSADOR RESOLUTE ABOUT CHAVEZ'S GOVERNMENT CONTROL
OF NATION'S OIL INDUSTRY DESPITE WALKOUT BY SOME MAJOR U.S. FIRMS
HOUSTON
</P>
<P>
Venezuela's oil industry wants foreign partners to help tap its
vast resources, but they need not come knocking if they want to
call the shots, the country's ambassador to the United States
said Wednesday in Houston.
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Bernardo Alvarez Herrera said Venezuela is continuing
compensation talks with major oil companies that walked away from
their multibillion-dollar Venezuelan operations last month rather
than agree to terms of relinquishing control in the face of
President Hugo Chavez's nationalization of oil operations.
</P>
<P>
But those who stay -- or come later -- will do so with
Venezuela's government-controlled oil company in charge, Alvarez
told the Houston Chronicle editorial board.
</P>
<P>
"We want partnerships with private companies, but with that
rule," he said.
</P>
<P>
Later, during an appearance at a Greater Houston Partnership
luncheon, Alvarez was asked what Chavez wants to hear from the
new U.S. ambassador to Venezuela. "We are ready to respect
Venezuela," Alvarez replied.
</P>
<P>
Patrick Duddy, a senior State Department official, recently was
named to succeed outgoing ambassador to Venezuela William
Brownfield.
</P>
<P>
Alvarez is spending several days in Texas on a visit he said has
focused more on making community contacts than on the energy
business, though he conceded that it's "impossible to have a
completely non-oil visit to Texas."
</P>
<P>
Alvarez said he has not encountered hostility from Americans
despite Washington's chilly relations with Chavez, a socialist
who once likened President Bush to the devil.
</P>
<P>
"At least they know who Chavez is," he said during the meeting
with the Chronicle. He said he has found Americans open to
discussions about differences and common interests involving the
United States and the South American nation.
</P>
<P>
In May, Petroleos de Venezuela, or PDVSA, took over operations of
major oil projects that had been run by Houston-based
ConocoPhillips, Irving-based Exxon Mobil, San Ramon, Calif.-based
Chevron Corp. and Paris-based Total. Most of the projects are in
Venezuela's oil-rich Orinoco River basin, but ConocoPhillips also
had an offshore project slated to begin producing next year.
</P>
<P>
Chavez had issued a decree mandating the turnover.
</P>
<P>
Last month, ConocoPhillips and Exxon Mobil refused to accept new
working terms for their Venezuelan operations and walked away.
PDVSA absorbed their stakes, and the companies are negotiating
compensation for what they gave up.
</P>
<P>
Chevron and Total agreed to stay on as PDVSA's minority partners.
London-based BP and Norway's Statoil, which already were minority
partners, also agreed to stay.
</P>
<P>
Analysts have valued the combined projects PDVSA took over at $25
billion to $30 billion. ConocoPhillips has announced plans to
write off the entire $4.5 billion value of its Venezuelan assets
in its second quarter results, but Exxon Mobil hasn't revealed
its plans.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, spokesmen for the companies couldn't be reached or
declined comment on Alvarez's statements or ongoing compensation
talks.
</P>
<P>
Alvarez said in the meeting with the Chronicle that he isn't
worried that the takeovers will chill future investment or
participation from foreign companies.
</P>
<P>
While ConocoPhillips and Exxon left, others remain, he said, and
more have been invited to explore and develop the Orinoco region,
including Russia's Lukoil, Brazil's Petrobras, China's CNPC and
India's ONGC. This week PDVSA announced that Venezuela and Iran
will collaborate to spend $4 billion on a joint Orinoco project.
</P>
<P>
Alvarez said Venezuela is especially interested in attracting
investment from smaller businesses, and ones owned by blacks and
Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
Alvarez also said oil services providers, such as Schlumberger
and Halliburton, can fill the gap of technical expertise left by
pullouts of international oil companies.
</P>
<P>
Patrick Esteruelas, an analyst with political risk consultancy
Eurasia Group, said the aftermath may be more complicated than
Alvarez suggests.
</P>
<P>
He said other companies may be hesitant to invest when contracts
could change in midstream.
</P>
<P>
Also, he said questions loom as to whether other companies have
the know-how to successfully develop heavy oil projects and
maximize production in the Orinoco, where estimated reserves
could surpass those in Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
"Frankly I think ConocoPhillips' and Exxon Mobil's refusal to
accept new contracts has shown there are certain limits to how
far Venezuela can take the game," Esteruelas said. "I think the
government will have to recalibrate and re-evaluate its prospects
unless it wants to run the risk of either pushing other companies
out or failing to convince any new companies to step in."
</P>
<P>
Also, Esteruelas noted that in mid-May, the Venezuelan government
said it might take over 18 oil rigs now operated by oil service
companies and create a PDVSA subsidiary to tighten control of
drilling operations throughout the country. That could prompt oil
service companies to hold back on drilling expansion, he said.
</P>
<P>
If compensation talks fail and ConocoPhillips and Exxon Mobil
turn to international arbitration, Venezuela has something to
lose. Its American assets -- notably five refineries run by its
Houston-based subsidiary, Citgo -- could be targeted for seizure
to compensate ConocoPhillips and Exxon Mobil.
</P>
<P>
Alvarez was unconcerned about that possibility. He said he hoped
compensation talks would succeed, rendering the lengthy,
expensive arbitration process unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
"It is the best for everybody else to go and reach an agreement,"
he told the Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
He also said that during his visit, he would meet privately with
officials of Chevron and Citgo. He had no meetings scheduled with
ConocoPhillips or Exxon Mobil.
