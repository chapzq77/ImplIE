Rice plant in Tainan County promoting 'duck farming' technique

<P>
A rice production plant in southern Taiwan's Tainan County is
trying to promote a farming technique that replaces pesticides
with ducks, plant owner Huang Li- chin said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Huang said the method of cultivation allows rice fields to be
playgrounds for ducks, which eat insects and apple snails that
harm rice crops and whose excrement can be used as organic
fertilizer.
</P>
<P>
But since Fangjung Rice Plant launched the program to use ducks
in rice farming in 2006, only six farmers have participated in
it, with the total farmland using this method reaching only three
hectares, Huang said.
</P>
<P>
Hoping that more farmers and consumers will support this unique
organic farming technique, Huang said she is trying to get
produce generated under the program certified as organic produce.
She said she is confident this can be achieved within one year.
</P>
<P>
Huang explained that three years is the minimum time it takes for
a farm's produce to pass organic examinations.
</P>
<P>
Contract farmers have to abide by certain regulations. They have
to grow the strain selected by the rice production plant and
cannot use any pesticides or chemical fertilizers, Huang said.
</P>
<P>
Persuading farmers to switch from the pursuit of production
volume to quality is the most difficult part of promoting the
farming technique, even though farmers know that it is a good
technique passed down by their ancestors, Huang said.
</P>
<P>
She is the fourth-generation owner of the plant that was founded
in 1926.
</P>
<P>
The six contract farmers currently using this method raise ducks
beside their rice farms. Three farmers who cultivate a
1.68-hectare plot of land together have had to raise about 500
ducks to help them with their organic efforts, Huang said.
</P>
<P>
"We experimented with creatures like frogs and chicken in
carrying out the mission, but found that ducks are the most
effective, " Huang said.
</P>
<P>
All produce grown on farmland using this special technique have
passed pesticide tests, she emphasized.
</P>
<P>
Huang noted that while ducks eat rice too when there are not many
bugs around, they are still beneficial to farmland. She added
that having ducks in rice fields is also a good way to attract
tourists to the area.
