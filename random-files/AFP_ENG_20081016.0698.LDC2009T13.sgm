Sri Lanka's largest biscuit maker said Thursday it was
withdrawing one of its products from sale after Swiss authorities
identified it as having traces of melamine.

<P>
Ceylon Biscuits Limited said their Munchee Lemon Puff biscuits
will be withdrawn from the market because of the reports, but
maintained it was not using milk products from China.

The "milk ingredients were sourced only from Australia, Holland
and Canada," the company said in a statement.

On Monday, authorities in the Swiss canton of Geneva identified
Munchee Lemon Puff biscuits as containing traces of melamine.

<P>
Melamine, a poisonous substance generally used in the manufacture
of plastic, has been found to be added to Chinese milk, forcing
dairy products and some confectioneries off the shelves in many
countries.

Four Chinese children are known to have died and at least 53,000
made ill after consuming melamine-laced milk.
