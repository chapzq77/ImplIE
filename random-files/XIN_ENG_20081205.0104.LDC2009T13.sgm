(Special for CAFS) More river cholera tests results expected in
South Africa
</P>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, Dec. 5 (Xinhua) -- The results of further tests
done to determine if the Limpopo river is contaminated with
cholera are expected by Saturday.
</P>
<P>
South African government spokesman Themba Maseko told a media
briefing in Pretoria on Friday that the department of water and
forestry in Limpopo had increased its surveillance and monitoring
of all rivers in the northern Limpopo.
</P>
<P>
"All tap water audits thus far have tested negative for any kind
of cholera contamination, which means that tap water on the South
African side is indeed safe for human consumption." he said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, the provincial health department confirmed
that cholera bacteria had been found in the Limpopo river.
</P>
<P>
He said the national regulation unit was also monitoring areas
close to the Zimbabwean border -- the origin of contamination --
to determine the health of the communities of Musina and Madibo.
</P>
<P>
Samples taken, which include raw sewage, would indicate whether
cholera is present in waste water.
</P>
<P>
"Further tests will help determine whether potable water quality
has deteriorated since the last round of sampling," Maseko said.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Limpopo Health spokesman Phuti Seloba said the
department is still awaiting the results of tests done to see if
the Nwanedzi river was contaminated by cholera.
</P>
<P>
He said it was not clear when the results for the river, which
serves communities in Madombo and Masisi, would be released.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Maskeo said the government would send a delegation to
Zimbabwe on Monday to assess the deteriorating food and
humanitarian crisis.
</P>
<P>
The South African government and United Nations figures show that
more than 560 deaths and 12,500 cases of cholera have been
recorded in Zimbabwe since August.
