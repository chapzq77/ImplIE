Report: US candidates increase health coverage

John McCain's health care plan would reduce the ranks of the
roughly 45 million uninsured Americans by about 21.1 million
people if fully implemented by 2010, while Barack Obama's would
reduce the number by 26.6 million, a new analysis predicts.
</P>
<P>
Some previous reviews of the two presidential candidates' health
plans indicated that Republican McCain's proposals would amount
to little more than a wash when it comes to the number of
uninsured in the United States.
</P>
<P>
The analysis released Wednesday by The Lewin Group, a consulting
firm, drew a more optimistic scenario about the overall number of
people who would get health coverage under McCain's plan.
</P>
<P>
The cost for both candidates' plans are enormous. McCain's plan
was projected to cost more than $2 trillion from 2010 through
2019. Democrat Obama's plan would cost $1.17 trillion. Neither
candidate provides specifics on how to cover the costs, The Lewin
Group said.
</P>
<P>
The United States, which has a population of about 300 million,
is one of the few western countries without universal health
care.
</P>

McCain has proposed two distinct changes to the current system.
The first is a tax credit of $2,500 for individuals or $5,000 for
a family that buys health insurance. The credit would replace the
tax break people now get for obtaining health coverage through
their work. Second, McCain calls for letting people shop across
state lines when buying insurance, essentially letting millions
bypass states where insurance is more expensive and
comprehensive.
</P>
<P>
About half of the nation's uninsured adults are ages 19-34. They
are the youngest and cheapest to cover, and they are the ones
that would generally gain coverage under McCain's proposal,
Sheils said.
</P>
<P>
Obama's plan would expand health insurance coverage through
public programs. He requires all children to have health
coverage. In all, about 16 million people would gain coverage
through those programs. Another 10 million would use government
subsidies to buy insurance coverage.
