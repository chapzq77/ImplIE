NOT THE SEASON YANKEES MANAGER JOE GIRARDI EXPECTED
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK
</P>
<P>
Several months ago, manager Joe Girardi studied the Yankees'
schedule and noticed that their final game at Yankee Stadium
would be Sept. 21. But Girardi did not believe it would be the
final time he would manage in the ballpark. He expected the
Yankees to make the playoffs in his first season, expected the
Stadium to live into October in its last season.
</P>
<P>
But sometime soon, the Yankees will learn that they have been
mathematically eliminated from postseason contention. Girardi
will stop saying that the Yankees have not yet been eliminated.
The Yankees are about to miss the playoffs for the first time
since 1993, the year Derek Jeter made 56 errors at Class A.
</P>
<P>
The optimist in Girardi, who is present 23 hours 45 minutes a
day, has repeated that the Yankees still have a chance for a
miracle. The realist in Girardi knows that the Yankees, who had a
major-league-leading $209 million payroll when the season opened,
are wading through the end of a dark, disappointing season under
his watch.
</P>
<P>
"I think the way you rationalize it is we didn't do as well as we
were supposed to or as well as we thought we were going to,
however you want to put it," Girardi said. "We expected more. For
whatever reason or whatever number of reasons, we didn't get to
where we thought we were going to get."
</P>
<P>
As Girardi sifts through the damage of a year in which the
Yankees have spent only two days in first place in the American
League East, and none since April, he is more comfortable blaming
himself than he is in openly dissecting how and why the team
fizzled.
</P>
<P>
Girardi would rather say that he takes responsibility for the
season, because that is easier than trying to explain why the
high-profile offense was feeble, why the rookie pitchers Phil
Hughes and Ian Kennedy flopped and why second baseman Robinson
Cano and outfielder Melky Cabrera regressed. If Girardi blames
himself, it is cleaner than recounting the laundry list he
undoubtedly has in his head.
</P>
<P>
"Your job is to get the most out of your players," he said. "I
feel that I should have been able to make us better. I don't know
how you can think any differently."
</P>
<P>
Jeter, the team's captain, said that Girardi made a smooth
transition as Joe Torre's successor and did "a good job."
Although Girardi pointed 10 fingers at himself, Jeter twisted his
fingers in 25 directions.
</P>
<P>
"It gets to the point where you have to be accountable for your
own play," Jeter said. "I think sometimes, managers get blamed
too much."
</P>
<P>
Confident enough to wear No. 27 as the Yankees chased their 27th
World Series title, Girardi is now trying to keep his team from
finishing in fourth place. Although Hank Steinbrenner, the
Yankees' co-chairman, has complimented Girardi, the uninspiring
season has created questions about his performance.
</P>
<P>
Why did Cano and Cabrera stumble under Girardi's tutelage? Did
Girardi rely too much on statistics in benching left-handed
hitting veterans against left-handed pitchers? Is he too
controlling? How does his intense approach influence his players?
Can he be the manager who helps resurrect the Yankees?
</P>
<P>
Girardi says he still can make that 27 on his back meaningful.
</P>
<P>
"You don't really know what it's like to be the manager of the
New York Yankees until you go through it," he said. "It's like
people will say, 'I know what you're going through.' Well, you
don't know what I'm going through because you've never done it.
Until you actually sit in that chair, you don't know what it's
like."
</P>
<P>
When Girardi was asked to describe what it was like, he said he
could not because he was unsure what people imagined the job to
be.
</P>
<P>
Girardi is baseball smart and book smart, but his reticence to be
revelatory in many instances can be frustrating.
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged that he was guarded with information about
injuries because he did not want to give opponents the tiniest
morsel of data. Still, on multiple occasions, Girardi provided an
account of a player's injury only to have the player contradict
him and give a graver appraisal. Girardi said he did not mind if
those developments wounded his credibility.
</P>
<P>
"I don't necessarily worry so much about how I look," he said. "I
worry about the people who know me understanding why I did
something."
</P>
<P>
David Cone, who threw 88 pitches to catcher Girardi in fashioning
a perfect game with the Yankees in July 1999, is an analyst for
the YES Network. Cone said Girardi was excellent at maneuvering
his relievers, an area in which Torre drew criticism. Torre
overused some pitchers and did not trust others. Girardi squeezed
contributions out of Kyle Farnsworth and production from Jose
Veras, Edwar Ramirez and Brian Bruney.
</P>
<P>
But Cone also noted how Girardi, who managed the Florida Marlins
in 2006, needed to improve in other areas. Cone mentioned the
daily briefings with the news media.
</P>
<P>
"At some point, you have to give some real insight as to what's
going on and how you really feel as opposed to coming up with a
company line," Cone said. "It's one thing to be positive, which
obviously is what he's trying to do. It's another thing to also
be honest about how you really feel and what's going on. There's
a way to do it. He's still learning."
</P>
<P>
Girardi does interviews about 10 minutes after games, and he has
acknowledged that he is despondent after losses. Cone said he was
surprised at how dejected Girardi appeared after the Yankees'
first defeat of the season. Tony Pena, the first-base coach, said
Girardi would meet with the coaches after games to try to solve
problems.
</P>
<P>
"We suffer," Pena said. "Everybody suffers. We don't want to
lose. I don't think our players want to lose, either. We're
having a tough road. We're having a tough year."
</P>
<P>
Few have had as tough a year as Cano, whose average has plummeted
to .260 this season from .306 last year. His on-base percentage
is a sickly .294. Larry Bowa, a former third-base coach for the
Yankees, said he motivated Cano by getting "in his face." When
Girardi was asked if he or any coach did that with Cano, he said,
"We've done a lot of different things." In a move that is more
about next season than this season, Girardi removed Cano from
Sunday's game for not hustling on a fielding play.
</P>
<P>
Andy Pettitte said Girardi held several team meetings in which he
showed a fiery side, estimating that Girardi had challenged the
Yankees as much as Torre ever did.
</P>
<P>
"You know as well as I do, how many times can you do it?"
Pettitte said. "It's like beating a dead horse."
</P>
<P>
Girardi said he would make changes next season, but he was not
specific. He said he would review personnel and strategy
decisions to try to make sure the Yankees did not underachieve
again. He added that this season's experiences could cause him to
change, too.
</P>
<P>
Girardi, like the Steinbrenners, said he did not consider a
season triumphant unless it ended with a championship. There are
always "successful things" that happen across 162 games, he said,
but how a team finishes is all that is relevant.
</P>
<P>
"Did you get to where you thought that you should get?" Girardi
said. "With this team, right now, the answer is no."
</P>
<P>
The final answer will undoubtedly be no. The season will end in
disillusionment and without a trip to the playoffs, something
Girardi had not envisioned. The Stadium will close earlier than
Girardi expected.
