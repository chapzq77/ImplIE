GOING WITH THE FLOW
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Back in the 1970s, when Lou Casagrande was starting out as a
curator at the Science Museum of Minnesota, visiting a museum
aimed at kids sometimes felt like being in a "pinball machine."
</P>
<P>
"My instructions were to create energy and hands-on in every nook
and cranny," said Casagrande, who eventually became senior vice
president at the Minnesota museum before taking over as director
of the Boston Children's Museum in 1994. "We went probably too
far. It was too much energy. People would feel totally
overwhelmed and exhausted before they learned a thing."
</P>
<P>
That was then. Now, as Casagrande readies the Children's Museum
for its April 14 reopening, he's talking up the new exhibitions,
from the tennis ball launcher to a light-box dance floor. But
he's just as excited about a catchphrase he has been using to
describe the $47 million expansion project: Visitor flow. The
idea is not as glitzy as a cantilever or a glass elevator - two
of the snazzy features in the new Institute of Contemporary Art -
but it's good news to anyone familiar with the way the museum
used to feel.
</P>
<P>
"For us," Casagrande says, "this is the biggest revolution."
</P>
<P>
Anyone who ventured into the Children's Museum before is familiar
with the old building's shortcomings. Some spots - the fourth
floor KidStage, for example - were tucked away, almost impossible
to find. Then there were the high-traffic areas, made worse by a
central staircase that funneled all activity through the center
of the building. At times, the place felt like a cross between a
rush hour subway car and a sold-out rock club. Double-wide
strollers and kids running from exhibit to exhibit only
complicated matters.
</P>
<P>
The new building won't alleviate all these problems. But several
key design features should help. Start with the front door, now
given a proper place jutting out from the building fa?ade.
Before, the entrance was harder to define, one of several doors,
some locked, on the building's exterior wall, and leading to a
cashier's area partially hidden by the central stairway.
</P>
<P>
While many a city has gotten into the children's museum business
lately, Boston's edition has a long history. Founded in 1913 and
housed in Jamaica Plain, the museum opened its current home in
Fort Point Channel in 1979, renovating a 19th-century wool
warehouse.
</P>
<P>
Some 440,000 people pour through its doors annually, making it
the fourth most attended museum in the region. After two decades
in its spot, the museum undertook a renovation plan, closing on
Dec. 31 to complete its current expansion.
</P>
<P>
At the heart of the new Children's Museum is a glass-walled,
rectangular expansion that, in a sense, has been placed in front
of the taller, existing brick warehouse building. The defining
feature of the newer space is its open feel. The ceiling rises
three stories in the front atrium, before lowering - and adding a
second floor - as you move farther into the building.
</P>
<P>
A series of 10- to 12-foot-wide hallways, reached by a stairway
or elevator and stretching the entire length of the expansion,
connect the new section with the old. This is how visitors get
around. At the end of each of these hallways, there's a spot for
visitors to pause and relax. Inside the existing space - the old
warehouse - there are three floors for visitors.
</P>
<P>
Visitor flow has driven the new project to the point that the
expanded Children's Museum isn't actually all that much bigger
than the old space. In total, the museum now takes up 105,000
square feet, just 10,000 square feet more than before. How can an
expanded museum be barely expanded?
</P>
<P>
It was an easy sell to the museum's board, given the
institution's needs.
</P>
<P>
"You can't just use kind of the multiple of going from x square
feet to y," said Thomas E. Moloney, chairman of the board. "The
most important thing is the museum becomes much more functional."
</P>
<P>
Consider how the space is used. The fourth floor is now off
limits to visitors, used mainly for offices. A bigger and
technologically updated KidStage has moved from the tucked away
corner to the ground floor. With three floors, not four, open to
the public, activity is pushed down, and spread throughout.
</P>
<P>
You no longer have to walk through several activity areas - first
reached through the now-removed central stairway - to get to your
destination. Wide doorways have been cut into the brick that used
to be the outside of the museum. Each gallery is accessible
through the bridges.
</P>
<P>
Not every children's museum has the luxury of worrying about the
ease with which its visitors walk through the building. Smaller,
newer museums still have to rely on the more-is-better maxim.
</P>
<P>
"A museum at the stage Boston's at, where it's been around for so
many years, it has the square footage to focus more on visitor
flow," says Janet Rice Elman, executive director of the
Association of Children's Museums. "They also have more of a need
to do that because their anticipated attendance numbers are very
high."
</P>
<P>
There is a lot that's new about the expanded museum. The KidPower
section - in the glass-walled, new part of the building - will
feature the tennis ball launcher and hand-pedaled bikes that move
an exhibit sign up and down. There's a dedicated space for
traveling exhibitions.
</P>
<P>
A new, three-story climbing structure replaces the old, two-story
climb. And even the restaurant changes, from McDonald's to Au Bon
Pain.
</P>
<P>
But what excites Gail Ringel, the museum's vice president of
exhibits, is the 3,000-square-foot second floor space known as
The Common. Most days, it will feature a maze, musical chairs,
and a giant chess game. But in less than an hour, the staff can
break down, and move out, all the activities. What's left is a
large, central space for groups to gather.
</P>
<P>
"We get literally thousands of people here for Chinese New Year
and St. Patrick's Day," says Ringel. "We hosted significant
performances from area artists, dancers, and musicians in there,
and it was a serious impediment to flow in the museum. The Common
is going to be a very important space. It'll give families a
space to sort of rest and recharge. Then when we're having our
large festival days, the exhibits can be swept out."
</P>
<P>
Boston isn't the only children's museum concerned about the way
people get around the building. In Philadelphia, the Touch Me
Museum is constructing an $88 million building set to open next
year. But ask Nancy Kolb, the president and chief executive of
the museum, what she's most excited about and her answer is
parking and a new entrance.
</P>
<P>
"It's very important for visitors, and particularly for families,
that they not feel crowded," says Kolb. "It's scary enough to
come into a city."
</P>
<P>
The new Touch Me Museum is three miles away from the old
building. In an interview, Kolb doesn't even mention the
building's architect.
</P>
<P>
"It's the parking we're moving for," says Kolb.

Old reliables, new surprises
</P>
<P>
When the expanded Children's Museum reopens on April 14, there
will be a little of the old, and a little of the new. Here are a
few familiar exhibitions, and a few potentially exciting new
stops.
</P>
<P>
The old
</P>
<P>
Raceways, perhaps better known as "that place with all the golf
balls and ramps," has been rebuilt near the new front door, meant
to send a signal to children that the building might look
different, but it's still their children's museum.
</P>
<P>
Boats Afloat, with its mini-system of canals and riverways,
hasn't moved from the second floor, and hasn't been redone.
</P>
<P>
There used to be two mock supermarkets on the third floor. One is
gone, but the Colmado has been restocked, and is pretty much the
way it was.
</P>
<P>
The new
</P>
<P>
KidPower, in the front atrium on the ground floor, gives children
a chance to launch tennis balls by pulling a rope attached to a
bowling ball. They can also move a sign up and down by using
hand-pedaled bicycles.
</P>
<P>
The three-story New Balance Climb has levels that are meant to
resemble flying carpets. The device also offers one of the
museum's best views - if you're willing to climb for it.
</P>
<P>
The famous outdoor Milk Bottle (left) has been rebuilt, and a
series of mazes - made of rock and brick - have been installed on
a new plaza. Later this year, kids will be able to climb through
a series of boulders installed in the area.
