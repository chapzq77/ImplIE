CAUTION, NOT PANIC, SEEN AFTER DRUG WARNINGS
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A new study may help quiet fears that the suicide warning labels
on antidepressants are scaring countless patients away from
medications that could help relieve their suffering.
</P>
<P>
The warnings, which were mandated in 2004 by the Food and Drug
Administration, say the drugs can increase the risk of suicidal
thinking or behavior in some young patients. They stirred a
fierce debate among psychiatrists, health officials and patient
advocates, with critics saying the ruling (and the headlines that
accompanied it) went too far.
</P>
<P>
But the study, which appears Tuesday in The Archives of General
Psychiatry, finds that while the warnings appear to have alerted
patients and doctors to a possible risk, they have not caused a
sharp decline in treatment rates.
</P>
<P>
The report is not likely to be the last word on the
antidepressant debate, experts said. But they added that it
provided one of the clearest pictures to date of how patients and
doctors behaved in the wake of a controversial decision by drug
regulators.
</P>
<P>
The researchers analyzed prescription rates from three time
periods: May 2002 to June 2003, just before the debate over
antidepressant side effects flared; June 2003 to October 2004,
the period after the first public alert, that the drug Paxil by
GlaxoSmithKline was associated with an increase in suicidal
thinking in minors; and October 2004 to December 2005, the year
after the FDA called for prominent warnings on the labels of all
antidepressants.
</P>
<P>
They found that the rate of Paxil prescriptions for children and
adolescents decreased by 44 percent after the 2003 warning on
that drug. But the rate for similar drugs, including Prozac by
Eli Lilly, continued to increase in that age group through 2003
and fell off only slightly after the labeling change, in 2005.
The rate of prescriptions to new patients -- a particular concern
for psychiatrists critical of the warnings -- did not change
significantly during the warnings or after. Prescription rates to
adults increased in the years studied.
</P>
<P>
In sum, the drug agency's warnings seemed to prompt caution
rather than panic. "The concern that the warnings would have a
chilling effect on the treatment of depression in young people
was not borne out by the data," said the study's lead author,
Mark Olfson, a professor of clinical psychiatry at Columbia. His
co-authors were Steven C. Marcus of the University of
Pennsylvania and Benjamin G. Druss of Emory University.
