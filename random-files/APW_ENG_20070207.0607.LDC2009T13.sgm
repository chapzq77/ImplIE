Chemical pollution triggers alarm in industrial city near
Belgrade

PANCEVO, Serbia 2007-02-07 10:52:31 UTC

<P>
High levels of cancer-causing gases, apparently released by an
oil refinery, on Wednesday triggered a public alarm system in an
industrial city near Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
Sirens sounded in the morning and overnight in Pancevo, 10
kilometers (6 miles) east of the Serbian capital, prompting
thousands of residents to remain indoors as air levels of benzene
and chlorine soared to 10 times normal levels, officials said.
</P>
<P>
Serbia's environment minister Miroslav Nikcevic accused HIP
Petrohemija -- Serbia's largest petrochemical plant with annual
production of 800,000 tons of gasoline a year -- of releasing the
harmful substances into the air.
</P>
<P>
"They were siphoning the benzene in an open area, and the wind
was blowing toward Pancevo's downtown," Nikcevic said. "The
problem is that the plant's management informed no one about the
operation."
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's toxin levels were recorded at 118 micrograms per
cubic meter of air, or about 10 times the "normal levels" in
Pancevo, Nikcevic said.
</P>
<P>
That has triggered concerns in Pancevo, a city of some 50,000
people, as well as among Belgrade's population of nearly 2
million.
</P>
<P>
The plant was heavily bombarded during the 1999 NATO air attacks
on Serbia over the Kosovo conflict, causing leakage and
contamination of both the air and land. It has undergone repairs
since then but still lacks sophisticated safeguards.
