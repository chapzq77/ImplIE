FARC says killed leader prepared to meet French president

BOGOTA, March 4 (Xinhua)
</P>
<P>
Colombia's largest anti-government group on Tuesday said the
leader killed by the government in the Colombia-Ecuador border
was preparing a meeting, at the time he was killed, with French
President Nocolas Sarkozy.
</P>
<P>
The Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), said in a
statement that Raul Reyes, one of its top leaders, "died as he
was trying to get in a meeting with President Sarkozy where
progress would have been made in finding solutions to Ingrid
Betancourt's situation."
</P>
<P>
FARC is seeking to reach a deal with the Colombian government on
swapping some 40 high-value captives, including Betancourt, a
French-Colombian citizen kidnapped in 2002 while campaigning for
the presidency, with 500 imprisoned FARC members, including some
extradited to the United States.
</P>
<P>
Reyes, whose real name was Luis Edgar Devia Silva, was killed by
the Colombian military in an attack on a jungle camp across the
Colombia-Ecuador border on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
His death sparked a regional tension as Ecuador has accused
Colombia's cross- border move of a violation of Ecuador's
territorial sovereignty which was also condemned by Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
Ecuador broke off diplomatic ties on Monday with Colombia, while
Venezuela expelled the Colombian ambassador. Both Ecuador and
Venezuela have boosted their military deployment in the borders
with Colombia.
</P>
<P>
France had said that Reyes was their contact in seeking to free
Betancourt.
</P>
<P>
France's Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner, after Reyes' death,
called for more efforts to free Betancourt, saying "it is very
bad news that the man with whom we were speaking has died."
</P>
<P>
Bespectacled and bearded Reyes, had been regarded as FARC's No. 2
leader and a possible successor to the group's 77-year-old head
Manuel Marulanda.
</P>
<P>
Famous for his tough stance in the past negotiations with the
government, Reyes was FARC's public face as its official
spokesman who often sent statements from the mountains of
Colombia. A former union leader, he joined FARC in the 1970s.
