China's migrant workers cut adrift by global economic woes
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As the global financial crisis squeezes once-thriving Chinese
manufacturing regions, the fate of people like Xue Fengqiao looks
to figure ever higher on the Chinese leadership's agenda.
</P>
<P>
Xue, 24, and his fiancee migrated from poor Shanxi province to
coastal Fujian 14 months ago, dreaming of amassing a nest egg by
working factory jobs.
</P>
<P>
But both were laid off last month, joining the swelling ranks of
Chinese workers cut adrift by the crisis, and who now pose a
looming stability problem for China's leaders.
</P>
<P>
"We really don't know what to do. We can't go home but there are
fewer jobs here and they don't pay enough," said Xue, sitting
dejectedly in a government jobs centre crowded with anxious
unemployed workers.
</P>
<P>
Xue was let go by a machinery factory in this industrial town as
foreign orders dried up.
</P>
<P>
"It's even worse in other places. Everyone we know is desperate,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
China's ruling Communist Party already grapples with thousands of
violent public outbursts each year by marginalised people in
society.
</P>
<P>
And experts warn the problem could spike as more of China's
estimated 200 million rural migrant workers lose their jobs.
</P>
<P>
Layoffs had already been growing as Chinese manufacturers
retooled in recent years for higher-value products, said
Constance Thomas, the International Labour Organisation's China
director.
</P>
<P>
But the ILO expects "at least several million" new jobless due to
the global crisis.
</P>
<P>
"That has to be any leader's greatest fear -- to have a large
percentage of their population unemployed, without income,
without security. Clearly, measures have to be taken to ensure
that doesn't happen," Thomas said.
</P>
<P>
An estimated 30 million workers lost jobs from 1996-2004 as the
government restructured state-owned companies, causing widespread
protests and contributing to the masses of migrant workers today.
</P>
<P>
This time, authorities have even less control over the process,
said Willy Lam, a veteran China-watcher at the Chinese University
of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
"Last time, the government could slow down layoffs if needed. But
now global forces are at work. The leadership is very worried,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
The government this month announced a 586-billion-dollar package
to counter the export pain with infrastructure and other projects
that will create jobs.
</P>
<P>
The trouble has been most acute in southern Guangdong province,
China's manufacturing heartland, where one-fifth of factories in
major cities are expected to close by January alone, according to
industry estimates.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of workers have gathered outside shuttered factories
there, demanding unpaid wages, forcing local authorities to
intervene.
</P>
<P>
But the pain is now spreading up the coast to places such as
Tongan.
</P>
<P>
Gao Fengxiang, 42, came from central China's Hunan province in
February to a factory job here.
</P>
<P>
Three weeks ago he was laid off and his employer and government
officials have denied him required unemployment and medical
insurance, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We have been cheated. They lied to us," Gao said, his voice
rising in the Tongan labour office as fellow migrants murmured in
agreement.
</P>
<P>
The shabby office is packed with jobless workers checking job
advertisements offering 1,200 yuan to 2,500 yuan (about 175 to
370 dollars) -- about 50 percent less than earlier this year, Gao
said.
</P>
<P>
"None of the jobs pay enough. We're abandoned," he said.
</P>
<P>
The ILO's Thomas said China was ramping up re-training programmes
and addressing holes in the social safety net. She expects big
infrastructure projects to absorb many workers soon.
</P>
<P>
But far more is needed, given the problem's scale, she said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, many workers are giving up and heading home, according
to statistics showing increased rail traffic from manufacturing
regions.
</P>
<P>
Lam called that "disturbing".
</P>
<P>
"This hasn't happened before. After they return to Sichuan,
Hunan, Hubei or wherever, they are unlikely to find work there.
So we may see more rural disturbances," he said.
