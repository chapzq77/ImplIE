THIS RESEARCH IS A JOKE
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Don and Alleen Nilsen take humor seriously.
</P>
<P>
For the past 25 years, the Arizona State University professors
have studied the intricacies of humor and found patterns that
explain one of language's most powerful communication tools. They
can tell you why a particular joke succeeds and why another falls
flat.
</P>
<P>
Take the show The Simpsons. It works because it ridicules blue-
collar and other stereotypes and is full of clever, absurd
surprises, the Nilsens said. Their research may seem light-
hearted in an era when so much money and emphasis is given to
studying science and technology.
</P>
<P>
But humor has real-life implications. Using humor can give you
power in the workplace and help strengthen relationships. A
spontaneous joke relieves tension or saves face when your
presentation flops.
</P>
<P>
It also can have the opposite effect. Tell the wrong joke and you
alienate people and become a jerk. (More on that later, including
how to keep out of trouble.)
</P>
<P>
Forty years ago, Don Nilsen began using written jokes in his
English classes to make grammar lessons more interesting. His
students paid more attention to a funny paragraph than to a bunch
of sentences.
</P>
<P>
Intrigued, the Nilsens started investigating humor. They are both
literature professors, and the study fit with their love of
language.
</P>
<P>
The study of humor
</P>
<P>
The study of humor is fairly widespread, with international humor
journals and academic humor societies. The methods of research
are unconventional.
</P>
<P>
Instead of toiling in a lab, the Nilsens watch television sitcoms
and rent DVD comedies. They are voracious readers of anything
funny. Don Nilsen keeps a stack of index cards handy so he can
jot down anything funny that he reads or hears. Once a year, the
couple attends an academic humor conference where about 300
academics from around the world give humor presentations.
</P>
<P>
Talking about humor is not always sidesplitting. The Nilsens
approach humor the same way an academic researches Elizabethan
studies or a biologist examines the inner workings of a cell.
</P>
<P>
Don Nilsen considers himself a bad joke-teller, though it doesn't
stop him from trying.
</P>
<P>
"I'm just awful because I'm thinking, thinking, thinking and
setting up the joke. I get it set up really well, and then I
think, 'What was it about?' My students love to see me get caught
this way."
</P>
<P>
Even though he is joke-challenged, he and his wife believe the
average person can learn to be funny.
</P>
<P>
"It's more challenging with some people," said Alleen Nilsen,
citing former Vice President Al Gore as an example.
</P>
<P>
The key is to pay attention, be an observer and find your type of
humor. Some people are better at sarcasm, others at deadpan.
</P>
<P>
"Some people think the only type of humor is the type they use,"
Alleen Nilsen said.
</P>
<P>
But humor is much broader.
</P>
<P>
What is funny
</P>
<P>
In their research, the Nilsens have put together 11 basic types
of humor. They range from "superiority," which includes jokes
that put down Congress, to "hostility," which can be perceived as
hate speech, depending on the audience.
</P>
<P>
"Ambiguity," in which something can be understood in two or more
ways, is widely used. An example is: "Sign on a garbage truck:
Our business is picking up."
</P>
<P>
Some humor fits into more than one category, yet nearly all jokes
have common threads.
</P>
<P>
"Almost all jokes relate to errors or problems or tragedies or
something edgy, something that went wrong," Don Nilsen said.
</P>
<P>
Take this joke: "What do you give a man who has everything?
Penicillin." It uses disease to play absurdly on words that mean
an ultimate dream.
</P>
<P>
Humor pitfalls
</P>
<P>
Just as humor has common threads, humor gone awry can mean
trouble. Here are some basic rules to avoid trouble, what the
Nilsens call the Three Humane Humor Rules:
</P>
<P>
-Never target something people cannot change, such as their
height or sex.
</P>
<P>
-Never target the victim. This can be perceived as mean humor.
It's safer to ridicule politicians or big government.
</P>
<P>
-Use humor not to take away someone's power but to give them
strength.
</P>
<P>
Alleen Nilsen used to keep notes about humor that cropped up in
university meetings. Canned jokes often did not go over well
because they came across as forced.
</P>
<P>
The most successful administrators were the ones who made
spontaneous jokes that carried underlying compliments. People who
were witty enough to get a laugh were much more persuasive in
getting people to agree to their way of thinking, she said.
</P>
<P>
One spontaneous type of humor that often comes up in business
meetings is what the Nilsens call "hot potato humor." One person
makes a joke or clever remark about something that occurs in the
meeting. Someone else adds a funny thought. Others chime in, and
any tension in the room dissolves.
</P>
<P>
"The people who laugh together bond," Alleen Nilsen said.
</P>
<P>
Making fun of one's self also is fairly safe. Self-deprecating
humor is empowering, Don Nilsen said, because it says, "I'm
mature enough to joke about my issues."
</P>
<P>
Beyond the workplace, the Nilsens hope their research will make
people aware of how important humor is in communication. In the
end, humor can help you cope with life's problems.
</P>
<P>
"It's like changing a diaper," Alleen Nilsen said. "It's not a
long-term solution, but it helps for a while."
