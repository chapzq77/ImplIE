Lincoln's hometown marks 100th anniversary of riot
</P>
<P>
SPRINGFIELD, Illinois -- Two days of terror. Black men tortured
and hanged. A baby dead of exposure. Four white rioters shot by
black defenders. It wasn't America's first riot, and certainly
not the last. But this one was in the hometown of Abraham
Lincoln, the president who helped end slavery. Today, Lincoln's
city -- where Barack Obama launched his campaign to become the
first black president -- is finally commemorating the events that
erupted 100 years ago this month.  Hometown. By Christopher

Denver wants delegates to see the old and the new
</P>
<P>
DENVER -- This frontier town turned modern city wants to put its
best foot forward for the Democratic National Convention -- just
not necessarily one wearing a cowboy boot. Western duds -- like a
shiny pair of boots, a finely shaped Stetson and a pearl-snap
Western cut shirt -- would've been appropriate for the rodeo Rep.
Diana DeGette suggested for the party welcoming delegates and
news media. That venue didn't sit well with some of the
organizers and sponsors, she said, and they opted for an
amusement park setting. "They didn't want to look like a cow
town," DeGette said, declining to name anyone. "I thought it
would have been a great nod to our Western heritage and we could
talk about Western values as we move forward."  Town Conundrum.

Song, natural beauty draw visitors to Suwannee
</P>
<P>
FANNING SPRINGS, Florida -- Drawn by an old familiar song,
growing numbers of travelers are seeking out the tea-colored
waters of the Suwannee River. "Way down upon the Suwannee
River..." And galvanized by the song, environmentalists and
legislators are fighting to keep the stream unspoiled amid
thirsty Florida's development. "That song is something that
everybody learns as a kid ... and it just sticks in their mind,"
says a canoe outfitter on the river. "I think that's the biggest
thing that draws people here."  River. By Mitch Stacy. AP Photos

Fall foliage season is longer than you think
</P>
<P>
NEW YORK -- Late September and early October are typically the
best times to view fall foliage in the Northeast. But if you're
in Alaska, start looking for purple and gold in August. In the
South, in California, and even in New York City, you might see
colors well into November. The fall foliage season is longer than
you might think, and can be enjoyed in many different parts of
the country. It's also unpredictable, with peak viewing times
influenced by the weather.  Anytime. By Beth J. Harpaz. AP Photos

Raptor center gives a hoot, educates public

AWENDAW, South Carolina -- With owls swooping through trees as a
warm breeze washes in from the nearby Atlantic, a raptor center
newly opened to the public here may transport some younger
visitors straight to the pages of a Harry Potter book. Here at
The Center for Birds of Prey, you can see owls, hawks, kestrels
and other raptors in flight demonstrations. And you can wander
through the lavishly landscaped two-acre Owl Wood with its
collection of owls from around the world.  of Prey. By Bruce

In Washington, D.C., free attractions abound
</P>
<P>
WASHINGTON -- There are so many free and cheap things to do in
Washington that the biggest challenge is carving out enough time
to take advantage of them. Many museums, monuments and other
institutions - from the zoo to the botanic garden - that are run
by the federal government charge no admission. But even if you've
been here, done that 15 times over, the capital is packed with
new and overlooked attractions.  on a Budget. By Nancy Benac. AP

Cuban activists rely on foreign funding
</P>
<P>
HAVANA -- The money from abroad comes every few months, and after
she divides it among fellow dissidents, there's usually only
about $100 left for Laura Pollan. She helped start the Ladies in
White, a group of political prisoners' relatives. Cuba's
government says foreign funding makes the 60-year-old Pollan a
"mercenary counterrevolutionary," an ominous accusation since
scores of Cubans have gone to prison for allegedly taking money
to undermine the communist system.  or Mercenaries. By Will

Blobtown: Movie memories revitalize a community
</P>
<P>
PHOENIXVILLE, Pennsylvania -- There is a man. He carries a can,
and inside it is a weird, blood-red mass -- a hunk of goo the
size and consistency of a generous bowl of lumpy raspberry
Jell-O. Each summer, man and can climb into the car and drive to
a small town on the edge of the Philadelphia suburbs, not far
from where Washington spent that bitter, long-ago winter in
Valley Forge. For the man with the can, the town, Phoenixville,
is a place of history, too. Fifty years ago, this place was
touched by the spotlight. A small production company two towns
over made a film that no one expected to go anywhere. Instead, it
became one of the iconic sci-fi horror flicks of the 1950s and
introduced the world to an actor named Steve McQueen.  at

Charles Strouse recalls his B'way journey
</P>
<P>
NEW YORK -- The subtitle, "A Broadway Memoir," says it most
succinctly, but "Put on a Happy Face," the autobiography of
Charles Strouse, chronicles a fascinating journey through the
sunset of the American musical theater's golden era and beyond --
by the man who wrote the music for "Annie, "Bye Bye Birdie" and
"Applause." And the melodies still pour out as Strouse, who
recently turned 80, prepares for his next show.  Strouse. By

US truth emerges, too late for 'seductress spy'
</P>
<P>
SEOUL, South Korea -- She was the "Korean Seductress Who Betrayed
America," a Seoul socialite said to have charmed secret
information out of one lover, an American colonel, and passed it
to another, a top communist in North Korea. Kim Soo-im was
convicted and shot as a spy a half-century ago. But long-secret
U.S. military files, newly obtained by The Associated Press, tell
a very different story about this fateful love triangle. And the
executed woman's son -- the colonel's son -- is on a mission of
honor, to expose the truth and bury the myth.  Myth of Miss Kim.

Tree-killing bug menaces Europe's pine forests
</P>
<P>
CASTINCAL, Portugal -- The dense forests that blanket the
hillsides of this rural area of central Portugal are the latest
international conquest for a killer bug which has caused
ecological catastrophes in East Asia. Thousands of pine trees
here are already dead and pine wilt disease has become a menace
for pine forests across the borderless European Union, from
Scandinavia to Italy and Greece. "Future generations probably
won't know what we're talking about when we tell them about pine
forests," says a local landowner. "We'd better start taking some
photographs to show them."  Tree Killer. By Barry Hatton. AP

AIDS epidemic to build a nursery school, feeding program,
pharmacy, youth group and other projects with hardly any
international aid.  Women and a Village. By Barbara Borst. AP

GONDAR, Ethiopia -- Huddled in a leaky, flyblown hut, several
dozen Ethiopian Jews are soon to be transported from one world to
another. These latest immigrants to Israel are part of a drama
that has been unfolding for nearly a century but lately has
become enmeshed in a controversy that touches the heart of
Israel's founding philosophy.  to Israel. By Aron Heller. AP

they are beauticians, giving beauty to others where their own has

Book on race and retribution gets film treatment
</P>
<P>
MONROE, North Carolina -- Screenwriter Jeb Stuart was 14 years
old in 1970 when a black man was shot to death on a public street
as he begged for his life. The killing, trial, acquittals and
race riots played out in Oxford, barely 160 miles from Stuart's
home, but the writer of such action films as "Die Hard" and "The
Fugitive" was oblivious to it. Now Stuart is bringing the story
to the big screen by directing the movie version of "Blood Done
Sign My Name," author Tim Tyson's story of race and retribution
in the tiny farming community where he grew up.  Like Us. By

Debate over Erie Canal echoes its early history
</P>
<P>
ALBANY, New York -- When the Erie Canal was first proposed in
1808, many thought New York Governor DeWitt Clinton was foolish
for pursuing the idea -- they derided it as "Clinton's ditch." It
turned out to be an engineering marvel that brought tremendous
wealth to New York and opened up the North American interior.
Today, managers of the storied Erie Canal are pouring tens of
millions of dollars of public money into it each year while
opponents counter that the money would be better spent elsewhere,
especially as the state faces crushing deficits in coming years.

NEW YORK -- You don't have to have big bucks to have fun in the

your name down for a $20 front-row Broadway ticket. Here are some
details.  on a Budget. By Beth J. Harpaz. AP Photos NY415-420
