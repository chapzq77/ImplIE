ALGAE-ENERGY-SOURCE (Niland, Calif.).-- The idea of replacing
crude oil with algae may seem like a harebrained way to clean up
the planet and bolster national security. But Lissa Morgenthaler-
Jones and her husband, David Jones, are betting their careers and
personal fortunes that they can grow masses of the slimy organism
and use its natural photosynthesis process to produce a plentiful
supply of biofuel. No one has ever done it before, and it will
require not a small amount of money, luck and biotech tweaking to
do it. By Clifford Krauss.

LEONHARDT-COLUMN (Undated) -- Pay-for-performance is one good way
to improve the quality of health care. But there is a simpler
way, too: Publicly release information about hospitals and then
watch embarrassed doctors scramble to do better. By David
Leonhardt.

VENEZUELA-BONDS (Caracas, Venezuela) -- The plot would seem to
come right out of a novel in which the truth has many layers. A
group of investors from Columbus, Ohio, pays $100 million in
early 2004 for zero-coupon bonds from a Venezuelan state bank
that went bankrupt in the 1980s. A few months earlier, in October
2003, Venezuela's attorney general had determined the bonds were
valid. But when the investor group tries to redeem the notes, it
cannot, and only later learns that the attorney general had
reversed herself in December 2003.That is the basic story line in
an international financial dispute that is playing out in U.S.
District Court in Southern Ohio. By Jens Erik Gould
