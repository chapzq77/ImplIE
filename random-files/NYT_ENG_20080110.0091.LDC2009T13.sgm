FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE DON ' T EXPECT RECENT GUN-CONTROL LAW TO
REDUCE NRA ' S INFLUENCE ON CONGRESS

<P>
For a giddy moment there, sanity broke out all around and
Congress, with bipartisan support no less, enacted and President
Bush signed an actual, genuine gun-control bill.
</P>
<P>
The federal government during the next five years will provide
$1.3 billion in grants to gig the states into perfecting their
records of individuals who are disqualified by mental illness
from purchasing guns and then filing that information with the
national database gun dealers use to check purchasers'
eligibility.
</P>
<P>
This patently should have been the case all along, but the bill
was opposed by the gun lobby and flopped when it was introduced
in 2002. It took the deaths of 32 students and faculty and the
wounding of two dozen more at Virginia Tech last year to shame
the recalcitrant into concurrence.
</P>
<P>
The killer, Seung Hui Cho, had been adjudicated an "imminent
danger" to himself and others by a state court but was able even
so to buy the two guns he used for his massacre.
</P>
<P>
Even the National Rifle Association, which ordinarily sees a wolf
hiding in every common-sense gun proposal, didn't cry its
practiced faux alarm this time. And the Bush administration,
which had played the key role in putting semi-automatic assault
weapons back into civilian circulation, went along.
</P>
<P>
Which portents - well, absolutely nothing, of course.
</P>
<P>
Despite this rare lapse, the NRA and the rest of the gun lobby
are otherwise busy about their usual business of working - mostly
through state legislatures, with appalling success - to put more
firearms in more hands and in more public spaces.
</P>
<P>
The noisiest reaction to the recent murder of nine in a shooting
spree in a Omaha mall denounced the ban many malls have on
customers packing heat. If only shoppers had been armed, the
complaint went, they could have shot that sorry sucker dead. And
collateral damage from a bunch of amateurs blasting away in panic
in a crowded mall? Never mind.
</P>
<P>
Although the gun lobby is pushing for more concealed weapons and
to open parks, workplaces, arenas and other public spaces to
them, we are hardly a disarmed people even with those faint
inhibitors in place.
</P>
<P>
Reuters news service, in a piece last year, reported that the
United States is the most heavily armed nation in the world. We
have 90 guns per 100 of us, nearly a third of all the world's
private firearms.
</P>
<P>
Other industrialized western nations have gun murders in, at
most, the low 100s annually. We had nearly 11,000 in '05. And
477,040 violent gun crimes. Guns are the favored means of
suicide, too. Firearms are our eighth leading cause of death.
</P>
<P>
Meantime, the gaping legal loophole that allows gun-show sales
without background checks goes unplugged. Congress hustles to
protect gun makers from lawsuits and crooked or irresponsible
dealers from investigation and would limit local law enforcement
access to federal data that could help trace crime guns.
</P>
<P>
And the new Virginia Tech law notwithstanding, it will be ever
thus, for however long the gun lobby owns the Republican Party
outright and has Democrats terrified into comparable servitude.
