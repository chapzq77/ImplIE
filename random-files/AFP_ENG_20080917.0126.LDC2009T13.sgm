IEA head sees easing in oil supply-demand by year's end
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The head of the International Energy Agency appealed Wednesday
for oil producers to maintain output at current levels and said
supply and demand tensions on the market should ease by year's
end.
</P>
<P>
"To make the situation better, we want to see OPEC and producing
countries continue their current level of production," IEA
director general Nobuo Tanaka told reporters during a conference
here of the World Energy Council.
</P>
<P>
"Then, thanks to the (economic) slowdown in the United States and
(developed) countries, the market fundamentals will improve,"
Tanaka said, describing current conditions as still tight.
</P>
<P>
The Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), which
produces 40 percent of the world's oil, earlier this month cut
output by some 500,000 million barrels per day in an effort to
shore up prices which have fallen sharply from record highs above
147 dollars in July.
</P>
<P>
Oil prices were around 90 dollars Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, OPEC cut its world oil demand growth forecast for
2008 to 1.02 percent from 1.17 percent previously, in the face of
falling demand in the United States, the world's biggest energy
consumer.
</P>
<P>
It also trimmed its 2009 forecast to 1.00 percent from 1.03
percent.
