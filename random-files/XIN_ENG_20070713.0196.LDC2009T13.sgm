WASHINGTON, July 13 (Xinhua)
</P>
<P>
U.S. retail sales fell by 0.9 percent in June, the sharpest
plunge since August 2005, the Commerce Department reported
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The drop in retail sales for June followed an increase of 1.5
percent in May.
</P>
<P>
In June, sales of autos and auto parts dropped by 2.9 percent,
after a 1.1-percent gain in the previous month.
</P>
<P>
Sales at furniture stores were down 3.0 percent, the biggest
plunge since February 2003, following a small rise of 0.3 percent
in May.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, sales at hardware stores fell by 2.3 percent, while
sales at specialty clothing stores declined by 1.4 percent.
Department stores saw sales fall by 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
Gasoline stations saw sales drop by 1.1 percent, a decline
attributed to a temporary fall in gasoline prices in June.
</P>
<P>
Excluding auto and parts sales, total retail sales would have
fallen by 0.4 percent, the weakest performance in this category
since last September.
</P>
<P>
The performance in retail sales reflects the situation of
consumer spending, which accounts for two-thirds of overall
economic activity and is a major force pushing economic growth.
</P>
<P>
The June drop in retail sales was much sharper than the flat
reading expected by economists and raised new worries about
consumer spending, according to analysts.
