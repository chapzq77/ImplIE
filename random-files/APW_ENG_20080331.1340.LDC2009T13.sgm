It ' s OK to skip mouth-to-mouth and do ' hands-only '  CPR for
cardiac arrest in adults
</HEADLINE>

NEW YORK 2008-03-31 22:01:06 UTC
</P>
<P>
You can skip the mouth-to-mouth breathing and just press on the
chest to save a life.
</P>
<P>
In a major change, the American Heart Association said Monday
that hands-only cardiopulmonary resuscitation -- rapid, deep
presses on the victim's chest until help arrives -- works just as
well as standard CPR for sudden cardiac arrest in adults.
</P>
<P>
Experts hope bystanders will now be more willing to jump in and
help if they see someone suddenly collapse. Hands-only CPR is
simpler and easier to remember and removes a big barrier for
people skittish about the mouth-to-mouth breathing.
</P>
<P>
Hands-only CPR calls for uninterrupted chest presses -- 100 a
minute -- until paramedics take over or an automated external
defibrillator is available to restore a normal heart rhythm.
</P>
<P>
This action should be taken only for adults who unexpectedly
collapse, stop breathing and are unresponsive. The odds are that
the person is having cardiac arrest -- the heart suddenly stops
-- which can occur after a heart attack or be caused by other
heart problems. In such a case, the victim still has ample air in
the lungs and blood and compressions keep blood flowing to the
brain, heart and other organs.
</P>
<P>
A child who collapses is more likely to primarily have breathing
problems -- and in that case, mouth-to-mouth breathing should be
used. That also applies to adults who suffer lack of oxygen from
a near-drowning, drug overdose, or carbon monoxide poisoning. In
these cases, people need mouth-to-mouth to get air into their
lungs and bloodstream.
</P>
<P>
But in either case, "Something is better than nothing," Sayre
said.
</P>
<P>
The CPR guidelines had been inching toward compression-only. The
last update, in 2005, put more emphasis on chest pushes by
alternating 30 presses with two quick breaths; those "unable or
unwilling" to do the breaths could do presses alone.
</P>
<P>
Now the heart association has given equal standing to hands-only
CPR. Those who have been trained in traditional cardiopulmonary
resuscitation can still opt to use it.
</P>
<P>
Sayre said the association took the unusual step of making the
changes now -- the next update was not due until 2010 -- because
three studies last year showed hands-only was as good as
traditional CPR. Hands-only will be added to CPR training.
</P>
<P>
An estimated 310,000 Americans die each year of cardiac arrest.
Only about 6 percent of those who are stricken outside a hospital
survive, although rates vary by location. People who quickly get
CPR while awaiting medical treatment have double or triple the
chance of surviving. But less than a third of victims get this
essential help.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Gordon Ewy, who's been pushing for hands-only CPR for 15
years, said he was "dancing in the streets" over the heart
association's change even though he does not think it goes far
enough. Ewy is director of the University of Arizona Sarver Heart
Center in Tucson, where the compression-only technique was
pioneered.
</P>
<P>
Ewy said there is no point to giving early breaths in the case of
sudden cardiac arrest, and it takes too long to stop compressions
to give two breaths -- 16 seconds for the average person. He
noted that victims often gasp periodically anyway, drawing in a
little air on their own.
</P>
<P>
Anonymous surveys show that people are reluctant to do mouth-to-
mouth, Ewy said, partly because of fear of infections.
</P>
<P>
"When people are honest, they're not going to do it," he said.
"It's not only the yuck factor."
</P>
<P>
In recent years, emergency service dispatchers have been coaching
callers in hands-only CPR rather than telling them how to
alternate breaths and compressions.
</P>
<P>
"They love it. It's less complicated and the outcomes are
better," said Dallas emergency medical services chief Dr. Paul
Pepe, who also chairs emergency medicine at the University of
Texas Southwestern Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
One person who's been spreading the word about hands-only CPR is
Temecula, California, chiropractor Jared Hjelmstad, who helped
save the life of a fellow health club member in Southern
California
</P>
<P>
Hjelmstad, 40, had read about it in a medical journal and used it
on Garth Goodall, who collapsed while working out at their gym in
February. Hjelmstad's 15-year-old son Josh called paramedics in
the meantime.
</P>
<P>
Hjelmstad said he pumped on Goodall's chest for more than 12
minutes -- encouraged by Goodall's intermittent gasps -- until
paramedics arrived. He was thrilled to find out the next day that
Goodall had survived.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, he visited Goodall in the hospital where he is
recovering from triple bypass surgery.
</P>
<P>
"After this whole thing happened, I was on cloud nine," said
Hjelmstad. "I was just fortunate enough to be there."
</P>
<P>
Goodall, a 49-year-old construction contractor, said he had been
healthy and fit before the collapse, and there'd been no hint
that he had clogged heart arteries.
</P>
<P>
"I was lucky," he said. Had the situation been reversed, "I
wouldn't have known what to do."
</P>
<P>
"It's a second lease on life," he added.
