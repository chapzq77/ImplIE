WASHINGTON, Oct. 16 (Xinhua)
</P>
<P>
U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said on Thursday the plan
of direct U.S. stake in banks is focused on regulated firms,
indicating unregulated firms such as hedge funds won't initially
get government aid.
</P>
<P>
"We're focused on financial institutions, regulated financial
institutions," Paulson said in an interview with Bloomberg
Television, when asked whether hedge funds might also be
eligible.
</P>
<P>
"The program right now is for banks and thrifts," he was quoted
as saying.
</P>
<P>
Banking strains have hurt broader economic growth, pushing the
United States toward a recession. "There's been a shock in the
credit markets, and that's exacted a toll on the real economy,"
said Paulson.
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged that the U.S. economy faces "a number of tough
months" ahead.
</P>
<P>
In a separate interview on Fox Business Network, Paulson insisted
the Bush Administration is pursuing the correct course now to end
the debacle.
</P>
<P>
"We will mitigate the impact on the real economy and we'll get
this financial system working again," he said.
