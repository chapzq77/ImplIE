Football: Etoile hold Sfaxien in African Confederation Cup final
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Etoile Sahel are favoured to lift the African Confederation Cup
after forcing a 0-0 draw at title holders CS Sfaxien Saturday in
the first leg of an all- Tunisian final.
</P>
<P>
The visitors had the best chance to break the deadlock during the
first half when Nigeria-born striker Emeka Opara broke clear only
to be denied by goalkeeper Jassem Khaloufi.
</P>
<P>
Sfaxien managed to create several clearcut scoring chances during
the second half, but an Etoile team playing only their second
match under caretaker French coach Herve Gauthier survived.
</P>
<P>
The club meet again on November 22 in the Mediterranean resort of
Sousse with the winners becoming the first club to win twice the
African equivalent of the European UEFA Cup.
</P>
<P>
Etoile, the only side to win every African club competition,
lifted the Confederation Cup in 2006 and other former winners
include Hearts of Oak of Ghana and Moroccan military oufit FAR
Rabat.
