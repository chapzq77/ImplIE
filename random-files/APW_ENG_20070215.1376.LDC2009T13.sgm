Family back home in Bosnia describes Utah gunman as child of war
and upheaval

TALOVICI, Bosnia-Herzegovina 2007-02-15 18:57:16 UTC

<P>
Relatives back home say Utah gunman Sulejman Talovic's early life
in the Balkans was marked by war, poverty and upheaval: the
family fled by foot from Serb forces when Talovic was just 4
years old, and his grandfather was killed by a Serb bomb.
</P>
<P>
Talovic was just a toddler when the war broke out in Bosnia in
1992. Serb troops laid siege to the tiny hamlet of Talovici in
northeastern Bosnia, bombing it for a year before finally
overrunning the village in March 1993, relatives said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"We were besieged and bombed day and night. We couldn't stick our
noses out of the house," recalled cousin Redzo Talovic, 59.
</P>
<P>
"At first we all hid from the shells, but later we gave up on
life, didn't care and started coming out. That's how later the
shelling killed 20 people in the village," Rezdo Talovic said.
</P>
<P>
Sabira Talovic fled on foot with Sulejman, his three sisters and
his grandfather, while her husband, Suljo, hid in the mountains
with other men from the village, relatives said.
</P>
<P>
"Many left the village, only a few made it," said Murat Avdic,
54, a friend of the family.
</P>
<P>
The mother and children, exhausted, desperate and hungry, made
their way the to nearby enclave of Srebrenica -- also besieged,
bombed and crowded with starving families like the Talovics. One
of the bombs killed Sulejman's grandfather but relatives say
despite the conditions, they were a quiet, gentle and caring
family.
</P>
<P>
"Those were really nice people, never argued with anybody about
anything. During the war, they shared the little food they had
with others," said Sefko Talovic, 59, a distant relative. "His
father helped other injured people flee when the village fell
although he himself was injured too," he said.
</P>
<P>
Later that year, Sabira Talovic and the four children were among
the displaced rescued by the U.N. They made their way to the
government-controlled town of Tuzla, impoverished but safe.
</P>
<P>
"I remember they arrived in 1993 on an overloaded U.N. truck and
settled here in an empty house the owner had left," said former
neighbor Zijad Cerkic in the Tuzla suburb of Bare.
</P>
<P>
"They were very poor, they had lost everything, but they were
very nice and quiet people," Cerkic said, recalling the young
Sulejman as "a good child, always with a smile on his face."
</P>
<P>
Sulejman's father, meanwhile, narrowly survived the 1995 massacre
in Srebrenica of some 8,000 Muslim men and boys by Serb forces
loyal to then-Yugoslav leader Slobodan Milosevic. The massacre of
civilians was Europe's worst since World War II.
</P>
<P>
The family finally reunited in Tuzla later that year when a peace
agreement brought an end to the war. But the accord divided up
the country, putting their native Talovici in the Serb-controlled
half of the country -- and they did not dare return, relatives
said.
</P>
<P>
They made their way to Zagreb, Croatia, where they obtained
Croatian citizenship. In 1998, they joined family members already
living in Utah. They created new lives for themselves in Salt
Lake City, relatives said.
</P>
<P>
"I spoke to his father on the phone almost every month since they
left to the United States, and he said for the first time they
have a decent life, they have a home, jobs and they were happy,"
said Redzo Talovic.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Sulejman Talovic -- described by his Utah neighbors as
a "loner" who always dressed in black -- opened fire at a Salt
Lake City shopping mall, killing five people and wounding four
before being shot dead by police.
</P>
<P>
The news came as a shock to his extended family back in Talovici.
</P>
<P>
"When I heard his name on TV, I fainted. I still can't believe
what he did," said a cousin, Mina Talovic, 54. "I remember him as
a happy little boy sitting in my lap."
</P>
<P>
"Not in my wildest dreams could I have presumed Sulejman killed
those people. When I heard his name, I fell from the sofa," Redzo
Talovic said.
</P>
<P>
"What got into him? This is what we are all asking ourselves. We
are all in shock," he said.
</P>
<P>
Avdic speculated that the teen had been traumatized by what he
saw and experienced as a child of war. Up to 200,000 people were
killed in the 1992-95 war in Bosnia, and 1.8 million others lost
their homes.
</P>
<P>
"I'm convinced the war did this in Utah," he said. "There cannot
be any other reason."
</P>
<P>
Relatives describe a clan scarred and scattered by a war that
destroyed their lives and kept them far from home. Most of the
homes in Talovici remain in ruins, including the house Suljo
Talovic built a year before the war broke out.
</P>
<P>
Most of the 30 original families living in Talovici fled -- most
to Switzerland or to the U.S., said Sefko Talovic.
</P>
<P>
"Nobody even thought of returning into Serb land," he said. "Only
in 2000 a few of us visited Talovici for the first time.
Everything was burned and destroyed."
</P>
<P>
In 2003, eight families returned home and fixed up their homes --
and Sulejman Talovic's family was talking about doing the same,
relatives said.
</P>
<P>
"We are all dismayed. We are having a hard time connecting that
horrible act with the little smiling boy we remember," Redzo
Talovic said.
