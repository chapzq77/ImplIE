quarterly growth since 2001

Second-quarter earnings at International Business Machines Corp.
rose 12 percent and beat Wall Street forecasts Wednesday, largely
on the strength of IBM's software division and improvement in its
services unit.
</P>
<P>
From April through June, the Armonk, New York-based technology
bellwether earned $2.26 billion (euro1.64 billion), $1.55
(euro1.12) per share, on revenue of $23.8 billion (euro17.27
billion).
</P>
<P>
In the comparable period last year, IBM earned $2.02 billion
(euro1.47 billion), $1.30 (euro.94) per share, on revenue of
$21.9 billion (euro15.89 billion).
</P>
<P>
This year's quarterly numbers were boosted $81 million (euro58.79
million), or 5 cents per share, from the sale of IBM's printing
division to Ricoh Co. Without that gain, IBM would have earned
$1.50 (euro1.09) per share, beating the estimate of $1.47
(euro1.07) expected by analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial.
Analysts were expecting revenue of $23.1 billion (euro16.76
billion).
</P>
<P>
IBM's overall sales growth of 9 percent in the second quarter
would have been 6 percent if not for weakness in the dollar.
Softness in the greenback makes deals done in other currencies
translate into more dollars.
</P>
<P>
IBM's chairman and CEO, Samuel Palmisano, said the performance
marked IBM's best quarterly revenue growth since 2001. The
company's overall profit margins also increased slightly.
</P>
<P>
IBM's shares surged to multiyear highs this week after some
analysts predicted IBM would exceed Wall Street's forecast.
Before the earnings report came out Wednesday, IBM stock gained
31 cents to close at $111.08. In after-hours trading, shares
gained $1.17.
</P>
<P>
One common gauge of IBM's health is services contract signings,
because it foretells huge chunks of revenue that will be booked
in future quarters. IBM's services division inked $11.7 billion
(euro8.49 billion) in contracts in the second quarter, compared
with an unusually soft $9.6 billion (euro6.97 billion) a year
ago.
</P>
<P>
Revenue actually booked in the second quarter rose 10 percent to
$13.1 billion (euro9.51 billion).
</P>
<P>
IBM's hardware division saw revenue rise 2 percent to $5.1
billion (euro3.7 billion), though it would have been flat if not
for currency fluctuations.
</P>
<P>
Software is IBM's smallest unit but accounts for an outsized
portion of IBM's profit. That has prompted the company to make
dozens of acquisitions to bolster its security and business-
management offerings, including this week's $161 million
(euro116.84 million) deal for DataMirror Corp.
</P>
<P>
IBM software revenue grew 13 percent to $4.8 billion (euro3.48
billion) in the second quarter, and pre-tax profit was $1.25
billion (euro0.91 billion), just slightly less than what the much
bigger services arm generated. The sales growth would have been 9
percent at constant currency rates.
</P>
<P>
In the first six months of the year, IBM earned $4.11 billion
(euro2.98 billion), $2.75 (euro2) per share, with revenue of
$45.8 billion (euro33.24 billion). Those numbers all rose from
the first half of 2006, when IBM showed profit of $3.73 billion
(euro2.71 billion), $2.37 (euro1.72) per share, and revenue of
$42.5 billion (euro30.84 billion).
