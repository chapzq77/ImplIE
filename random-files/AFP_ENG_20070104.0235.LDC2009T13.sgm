Latvia remembers two young soldiers killed in Iraq blast
</HEADLINE>

Political leaders, diplomats, military personnel and hundreds of
civilians gathered Thursday in St Peter's church in Riga to bid
farewell to two young Latvian soldiers killed in Iraq last week.
</P>
<P>
Latvian army privates Vitalijs Vasiljevs, 24, and Gints Bleija,
25, were killed by a roadside bomb near the central town of Al
Diwaniyah on December 27, the first combat fatalities from the
Baltic state since it sent soldiers to Iraq in 2003.
</P>
<P>
"They were the best of soldiers," the chaplain of the Latvian
armed forces, Elmars Plavins, said during the funeral service for
the two soldiers.
</P>
<P>
"God's mercy towards our troops has been immense so far," Plavins
said, alluding to the fact that Latvian soldiers had suffered no
casualties in Iraq since a soldier was killed in a demining
operation in 2004.
</P>
<P>
The two soldiers had carried out their duty "without grumbling or
doubting", said Plavins.
</P>
<P>
Among the dignitaries attending the ceremony, Latvian President
Vaira Vike- Freiberga stopped and bowed silently in front of the
two coffins, and laid a wreath alongside many others composed of
maroon-red and white flowers, the colours of the Latvian flag.
</P>
<P>
"The whole of Latvia is in mourning today," said Plavins.
</P>
<P>
The sobs of grieving friends and family of the fallen filled the
historic church as the caskets of the two soldiers were carried
down the aisle by a guard of honour.
</P>
<P>
"Our mission in Iraq will continue as long as necessary, but our
duties there are changing," Defence Minister Atis Slakteris told
AFP at the funeral service.
</P>
<P>
The commander of the battalion the two soldiers belonged to said
morale among Latvian troops who arrived in Iraq this week for a
six-month tour of duty was high, in spite of the loss of their
colleagues.
</P>
<P>
"We can never get used to these tragedies," Major Ilmars Lejins
told AFP at the church in Riga's Old Town.
</P>
<P>
"Let us be grateful that three other soldiers survived the
attack," he said, adding that the new deployment of soldiers was
"ready to stand in for those who fell."
</P>
<P>
Three other Latvian soldiers were wounded when an improvised
explosive device (IED) went off as their Hummer vehicle drove
past last week, killing Vasiljevs and Bleija.
</P>
<P>
The vehicle was on its way back to the soldiers' base at Al
Diwaniyah, southeast of Baghdad, the armed forces said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
The young soldiers were killed shortly before their six-month
tour of duty in Iraq was due to end. Vasiljevs was completing his
second stint in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Lawmakers in Latvia, which is a staunch ally of the United
States, voted three weeks ago to extend the mission of the Baltic
state's troops in Iraq by one more year.
</P>
<P>
Latvia, which has a population of 2.3 million, currently has 124
soldiers in Iraq.
