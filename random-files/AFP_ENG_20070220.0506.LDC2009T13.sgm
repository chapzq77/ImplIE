separated right shoulder when he slipped and fell on a patch of
ice and will likely be sidelined for up to two months.

The National Basketball Association club announced the injury
here on Tuesday, adding him to a list of absentees that include
center Kwame Brown and forward Luke Walton, who both have
sprained ankles.

Radmanovic, signed by the Lakers last July as a free agent, was
slowed by a hand injury early in the season.

The Serbian big man is averaging just 6.9 points and 3.4 rebounds
in 52 games. He is shooting less than 43 percent from the field
and 34 percent from 3-point range.

Radmanovic averaged 10.7 points and 5.7 rebounds last season in
30 games with the Los Angeles Clippers last season after being
