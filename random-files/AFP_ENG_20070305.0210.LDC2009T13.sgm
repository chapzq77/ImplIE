Rebels say Sri Lanka preparing for attack
</HEADLINE>

Sri Lanka's rebel Tamil Tigers told peace-broker Norway Monday
that government troops were preparing for a large-scale military
attack and warned of a possible bloodbath.
</P>
<P>
The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) said security forces
were massing in the northeastern district of Mullaitivu, where
the guerrillas have their main military bases.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE's political wing leader, S.P. Thamilselvan, told
Norwegian ambassador to Sri Lanka Hans Brattskar that the rebels
were aware of a military build-up and warned that they were ready
to resist.
</P>
<P>
"The present soft approach of the international community towards
Sri Lanka is not going to change its plans and will only
contribute to a worsening situation leading to a bloodbath in the
island," they said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The guerrillas are fighting for an independent homeland for the
minority Tamil community in this majority-Sinhalese country. More
than 60,000 people have been killed in the conflict since 1972.
