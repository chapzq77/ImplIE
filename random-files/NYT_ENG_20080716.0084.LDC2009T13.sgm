BLANK: ' FIRES DO BURN OUT '

ATLANTA -- He was an hour outside of London when the bell began
to toll. Arthur Blank was flying home from a Kenyan safari on his
private plane, scheduled to land in England to refuel, when the
pilot left the cockpit, a sheaf of paper in his hand.
</P>
<P>
"You need to see this," the pilot said.
</P>
<P>
It was a transmitted copy of Michael Vick's federal indictment.
The date was July 17, 2007. The football team on which Blank had
lavished so much money and care was about to unravel as
completely as any football team ever has.
</P>
<P>
One year later, the Falcons owner speaks of 2007 as "the season
that never ended. Every day there was another twist to the story
- there was the Michael Vick story, and then there was the Bobby
Petrino story. It was like someone kept adding another stick of
wood to the fire."
</P>
<P>
Then, after a pause: "But fires do burn out."
</P>
<P>
This fire, alas, had a wickedly long tail. Within five months,
Blank would find himself without both the quarterback he'd
supported and befriended - some say coddled - and the head coach
he'd hired for the express purpose of maximizing the
quarterback's singular skills.
</P>
<P>
Blank regards 2007 as "another reminder that even though you work
hard to try to build a roster of players capable of handling the
pressures of being a professional athlete both on and off the
field," the work carries no guarantee. Of Vick, he says: "On the
football field, he could cope."
</P>
<P>
Would Petrino's system and guidance have enabled this quarterback
to realize his massive potential? "Clearly the answer we felt
was, 'Yes.' But whether he would have proved he could play at a
very high level - a consistent level - we'll never know."
</P>
<P>
Early indications were encouraging. Vick's offseason workouts led
to in-house speculation that the Falcons could average 30 points
a game, a prognostication that would have left them second to New
England in scoring. But Vick never played a down for Petrino, who
left under cover of darkness for Arkansas after 13 games.
</P>
<P>
What if, Blank is asked, Petrino had had Vick at his disposal and
the Falcons would have started 4-3 instead of 1-6? Would the
grumbling about Petrino's methods have been silenced?
</P>
<P>
"It's possible, but to be frank, the issues Bobby had with the
players and communication started from the very beginning. ...
The players from the get-go felt disconnected. We would have had
to win a lot of games for (pacification) to take place."
</P>
<P>
For the owner, what was the nadir of the season without end?
Receiving the indictment? Seeing training camp begin with Vick in
court in Richmond, Va., and PETA protestors outside the gates at
Flowery Branch? Watching Vick address the media after pleading
guilty? Having Petrino bolt the day after Vick was sentenced to
23 months in jail?
</P>
<P>
"It was the day (Aug. 24) we received the document," says Blank,
referring to Vick's pre-plea statement of facts. "A lot had been
speculation up to then. ... Even after the indictment, Michael
was still saying, 'I'm innocent; you'll find that out.' ... The
reality was that what Michael had been saying was not true. It
was difficult when Bobby left, but I didn't have a six-year
relationship with him."
</P>
<P>
About Vick: "People say we shouldn't have supported the
quarterback that much, but what about New England (with Tom
Brady)? What about Indianapolis (with Peyton Manning)? With
Michael, as spectacular as he was - not always great - with that
kind of exciting player, he becomes in many ways the face of the
franchise."
</P>
<P>
The former face of the Falcons sits in a Kansas prison. A
radically different team - new quarterback, new coach, new
general manager - will open training camp next week. Of his
reconfigured club, Blank says, "I have tremendous expectations
this team will play hard and play well. ... There'll be a lot of
energy, a lot of discipline. We'll surprise a lot of people."
</P>
<P>
Already the summer has yielded one bit of cheer. The 2008 Blank
family vacation passed without untoward interruption. "We went to
Italy for 10 days," he says. "We didn't get any pieces of paper
over there."
