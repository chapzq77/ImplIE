NEWLYWEDS SEETHING AFTER A PHOTO STUDIO FAILS TO DELIVER
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Michael Ruiz de Somocurcio, a health insurance executive from
Clifton, N.J., paid $5,500 to Celebration Studios, a regional
photography service, before his wedding in September. The price
included albums, personalized thank-you notes and a DVD starring
his wife, Erika, and himself.
</P>
<P>
But the products never materialized. The company, with offices in
New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania, closed this month and is
filing for bankruptcy, its lawyers say. Hundreds of couples have
been left with no visual record of their wedding day, and many
brides-to-be who had made down payments now have no wedding
photographers lined up.
</P>
<P>
So instead of paging through their albums, newlyweds are filing
police reports and lawsuits, and sifting through posts on
Internet bulletin boards. And, along with people who are not yet
married but who paid Celebration Studios in advance, they are
vetting countless online offers from album makers, video editors
and last-minute photographers engaged in what one bride-to-be
called "ambulance chasing."
</P>
<P>
On Friday, the New Jersey attorney general's office filed a civil
lawsuit against the company and its owner, Marc S. Schwartz,
citing fraudulent practices. It also issued an order to prevent
them from selling or disposing of the wedding images that had not
been delivered.
</P>
<P>
"When you're playing with people's memories, it's not a beautiful
thing," said Ruiz de Somocurcio, 30, who has no images from his
wedding other than snapshots sent to him by friends.
</P>
<P>
Until recently, Celebration Studios had a reputation for
producing good work at a reasonable price. Couples frequently
took advantage of a 10- to 20-percent discount for paying in full
in advance. Last week, it was offering photography packages
priced up to $3,995 and video packages costing up to $2,295 on
its Web site, which has since shut down.
</P>
<P>
But the company's fortunes recently plummeted. Federal tax liens
of more than $456,000 and a New Jersey tax lien of more than
$86,000 have been filed against Celebration Studios in the last
two years, court records show.
</P>
<P>
The Montclair Police Department received about 40 fraud reports
about the company from Jan. 11 through Jan. 18, said Deputy Chief
Roger Terry. He said the department had not filed charges,
pending the outcome of various court cases.
</P>
<P>
Jeffrey Herrmann, a lawyer for Celebration Studios, provided a
copy of a statement from the company, which read: "The primary
intent of Celebration Studios has been and remains to preserve
the memories of its customers. Unforeseen financial difficulties
have made it impossible to continue our business operations and
deliver photos and videos in a timely manner."
</P>
<P>
The statement added that "to our knowledge, no photos or videos
have been lost or destroyed." On Monday, Herrmann said that the
copyrights of the images currently belonged to Celebration
Studios.
</P>
<P>
Schwartz did not respond to e-mail messages sent to two addresses
for him, and there was no response to phone messages left for
Celebration Studios last week. Herrmann said Celebration Studios
would be filing for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in federal court in
Newark in the next week. News reports of complaints about the
company appeared last week in The Star-Ledger of Newark and on
Philadelphia and New York television stations.
</P>
<P>
Photographers say they, too, have been cheated by the company.
Josephine Donatelli, a photographer from Scotch Plains, N.J., who
worked with Celebration Studios before opening her own studio,
said she had received checks from Celebration that had stop-
payment orders on them, and other checks that bounced. She
eventually got paid, after waiting three months.
</P>
<P>
"When you do a wedding, it's a 14-hour day often, and you spend a
lot of money in gas and put your whole heart into it, and then
you don't even get your gas money back," she said.
</P>
<P>
According to the suit filed by the New Jersey attorney general,
Anne Milgram, the nine-year-old company "engaged in the use of
unconscionable commercial practices, false promises,
misrepresentations and/or the knowing concealment, suppression or
omission of material facts."
</P>
<P>
Nathaniel Burney, a Manhattan lawyer, filed a lawsuit against the
company in state Supreme Court in Manhattan in December and is
seeking a class-action certification for it.
</P>
<P>
"As of 2005, obviously Celebration Studios knew that people were
not getting their pictures, and since then they continued
soliciting and taking people's money," he said, citing problems
at least two years old. "People are giving them their family
heirloom photographs and baby pictures, and not getting the
pictures of the most important days of their lives."
</P>
<P>
Melissa Brown, a New Jersey lawyer and bride who said she was
defrauded by the company, is also planning a lawsuit. She said
she stood to lose $5,700.
</P>
<P>
One bride-to-be, Lisa Trapasso of Ossining, N.Y., said she felt
betrayed by Celebration Studios. She and her fiance, Robert
Mockel, a New York City firefighter, paid $3,500 to the company
to shoot their June wedding.
</P>
<P>
"He's working two jobs to pay for the wedding, and I feel like
this money has been stolen from us," Trapasso said. "I feel rabid
about it."
