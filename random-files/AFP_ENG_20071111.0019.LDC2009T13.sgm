Future of Solomons PM uncertain after defections
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The political future of controversial Solomon Islands Prime
Minister Manasseh Sogavare was uncertain Monday after the
resignation of nine ministers.
</P>
<P>
The breakaway group, which includes deputy prime minister Toswell
Kaua, have petitioned the Solomon Islands governor general to
convene parliament for a vote of no-confidence in Sogavare's
government.
</P>
<P>
The group claimed Sunday it has majority support in the 48-member
parliament of the impoverished South Pacific nation of 500,000.
</P>
<P>
"We have 28 MPs including nine ministers and 17 opposition
(legislators)," one of its leaders, former minister Gordon Darcy
Lilo, told local reporters.
</P>
<P>
Other legislators who previously supported Sogavare are also
believed to have switched sides and the breakaway group say they
expect their numbers to swell further.
</P>
<P>
Sogavare has been shrouded in controversy since coming to power
in April last year after riots destroyed dozens of businesses
owned by ethnic Chinese and forced the resignation of his
unpopular predecessor Snyder Rini.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister put on a brave front, saying he was
unconcerned about the moves. But he held out an olive branch,
saying he was happy to talk to the defectors.
</P>
<P>
Most damaging for Sogavare is the defection of Kaua.
</P>
<P>
"Yes he is one of the ringleaders, his name is right on top of
the list," Sogavare told reporters.
</P>
<P>
The split was prompted by the sacking last week of finance
minister Lilo after he refused to comply with pressure to fire
the board of troubled national carrier Solomon Airlines.
</P>
<P>
Sogavare has accused Lilo of interfering in the operation of the
national airline and on Sunday he told reporters Lilo had been
implicated in corrupt practices including bribery.
</P>
<P>
Lilo rejected the allegations as "made up stories".
</P>
<P>
He said the defectors had pulled out of the government because of
concerns over the country's leadership, including Sogavare's
decision to boycott the recent Pacific Islands Forum leaders
meeting in Tonga.
</P>
<P>
"If this country gets in trouble where will we run to?" said
Lilo.
</P>
<P>
Sogavare stayed away from the meeting of leaders from 16 regional
nations over his opposition to Australian dominance of the
Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands (RAMSI), which is
formally under the control of the forum.
</P>
<P>
Sogavare has been in a long-running confrontation with Australia
since he expelled the Australian ambassador last year and
Canberra tried to extradite Solomons Attorney General Julian Moti
on child sex charges.
</P>
<P>
The rebels said they would decide through consensus their
candidate to take over as prime minister.
</P>
<P>
"We want a leadership that listens to the people," said Lilo.
</P>
<P>
The rebels said they would review the appointment of Moti, with
opposition leader Fred Fono saying he should be repatriated to
Australia to face the child sex charges.
</P>
<P>
RAMSI started as an Australian-led armed intervention in 2003 to
end five years of bloody ethnic strife in the Solomon Islands.
