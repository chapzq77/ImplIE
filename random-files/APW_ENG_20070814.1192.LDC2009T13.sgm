<P>
Temperatures of over 100 degrees (38 C) that have gripped the
Memphis area for days have been linked to two more deaths,
raising the toll to five, officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The deaths come as searing temperatures were recorded in the
south-central portion of the U.S., with South Carolina and
Missouri each reporting one heat-related death and Illinois
blaming three deaths on the heat since Thursday.

The temperature in Memphis rose to at least 100 degrees (38 C)
again Tuesday, the fifth consecutive day of triple-digit
fahrenheit highs. Last year, there were two heat-related deaths
in the area over the summer, said Shelby County Medical Examiner
Karen E. Chancellor.
</P>
<P>
The latest two deaths were a 75-year-old man found in a home with
no air conditioning and a 77-year-old woman found in her back
yard where she apparently had been gardening, Chancellor said.
Both were found Monday.

The National Weather Service predicts Memphis temperatures will
rise beyond the century mark through Friday.

<P>
Temperatures were in the 90s at midday Tuesday from the western
Plains to the East Coast, with scattering readings of 100 (38 C).
On Monday, thermometers registered above 100 in parts of Alabama,
Arkansas, Texas, Nebraska and Kansas, the weather service said.
</P>
<P>
Kentucky officials said the heat may have been to blame for one
death, but that had not yet been confirmed.
