Bush hints at US troop reduction in Iraq
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President George W. Bush, on a surprise visit to Iraq Monday,
said a reduction in combat troops was possible but sniped at
"nervous" US politicians ahead of a showdown with Congress.
</P>
<P>
Bush flew from Washington in total secrecy to this desert base in
Anbar province, where the US administration has taken heart from
the sight of former Sunni insurgents joining with US forces to
fight Al-Qaeda extremists.
</P>
<P>
He convened a meeting of his "war council" with Prime Minister
Nuri al-Maliki and other Iraqi leaders just days before US
commander General David Petraeus and US Ambassador Ryan Crocker
report to Congress on the progress of Bush's troop "surge"
strategy.
</P>
<P>
"General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker tell me if the kind of
success we are now seeing (in Anbar) continues, it is possible to
maintain the same level of security with fewer American forces,"
Bush said before leaving Iraq a few hours later for a summit of
Asia-Pacific leaders in Australia.
</P>
<P>
"I urge members of Congress to listen to what (Petraeus and
Crocker) have to say," he said, against a backdrop of two
military Humvees spotlit in the gathering night.
</P>
<P>
Bush's trip coincided with the withdrawal of British troops from
their last base in the southern city of Basra amid tensions
between Washington and its top ally Britain over their policy in
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"This is the last big gathering of the president's military
advisors and the Iraqi leadership before the president decides on
the way forward," Pentagon spokesman Geoff Morrell said.
</P>
<P>
The White House is to make a formal report to Congress by
September 15 aimed at persuading US lawmakers to continue funding
the Iraq war, four and a half bloody years since the US-led
invasion of 2003.
</P>
<P>
Staging a surprise detour from his trip to Sydney, Bush arrived
at the Al-Asad air base in Anbar along with Secretary of State
Condoleezza Rice and national security adviser Stephen Hadley.
</P>
<P>
Waiting for him were US Defence Secretary Robert Gates, General
Peter Pace, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral
William Fallon, the commander of US forces in the Middle East,
and Petraeus.
</P>
<P>
Hadley said Bush was trying to frame the debate that will follow
the Petraeus- Crocker report to Congress by spotlighting what he
sees as improved security.
</P>
<P>
"So the issue is are we at the point where we can continue to
make security progress with X number of forces?" Hadley said.
"That's what will begin to play out when General Petraeus returns
to Washington and begins his testimony to Congress."
</P>
<P>
On his first visit to Iraq since June 2006 and his third since
the invasion, Bush also met tribal sheikhs from Anbar province
who have given his administration hopes of a turnaround in the
deadly Sunni insurgency unleashed after the toppling of Saddam
Hussein in April 2003.
</P>
<P>
Opposition Democrats who control the House of Representatives and
Senate have been pushing for months to force a deadline for US
troops to leave.
</P>
<P>
But Bush and his generals have argued for time to make the troop
surge work after the US military deployed 28,500 extra soldiers
in February to try and end the violence.
</P>
<P>
In an address to raucously cheering Marines, Bush rejected the
intensifying pressure from Congress and reiterated his
controversial stand that the war in Iraq is a life-or-death
struggle against Al-Qaeda extremists.
</P>
<P>
"Those decisions will be based on a calm assessment by our
military commanders on the conditions on the ground, not a
nervous reaction by Washington politicians to poll results in the
media," the president said.
</P>
<P>
"In other words, when we begin to draw down troops from Iraq, it
will be from a position of strength and success, not from the
position of fear and failure."
</P>
<P>
Travelling to Anbar rather than Baghdad gave Bush an opportunity
to highlight the dramatic shift in sentiment in the province.
</P>
<P>
Gates said the general view was that security has improved not
just in Anbar but in other parts of Iraq as well as a result of
the surge.
</P>
<P>
"Clearly there is hard work that remains to be done in some
(areas) but the situation elsewhere is in pretty good shape,"
Gates told reporters.
</P>
<P>
But security officials said that shortly before Bush's arrival,
two car bombs went off in Anbar's provincial capital Ramadi,
killing four people and wounding 10. In Baghdad, police found 15
corpses of men shot dead.
</P>
<P>
The president's visit came just hours after 500 British troops
slipped out of their last base in Basra Palace under cover of
darkness, leaving behind a city in the grip of a brutal militia
turf war.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi soldiers hoisted the Iraqi flag and posted guards outside
the palace complex, which General Mohan Farhad, commander of
Basra military operations, said would remain under Iraqi military
control until Maliki decides its fate.
</P>
<P>
The evacuation of the troops to a desert airbase west of Basra
paves the way for a full British handover of security in the
region to Iraqi authorities, which could take place in the
autumn.
</P>
<P>
There are about 5,500 British troops in Iraq, most based in and
around Basra, although that number is set to drop to around 5,000
by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Gordon Brown stressed that British forces stood
ready to "re- intervene" in Basra if the security situation
demanded, telling BBC radio: "This is a pre-planned and this is
an organised move."
</P>
<P>
Locals cheered the withdrawal, despite warnings the city could
descend further into chaos.
</P>
<P>
"We are happy to be rid of the British. They were harassing us in
the streets and raided our houses and arrested our sons," said
army officer Sadoun Hami, demanding they quit the Basra area
altogether.
</P>
<P>
The United States and Britain have been at odds over Iraq
recently, with US officials voicing frustration at deteriorating
security in Basra.
</P>
<P>
General Sir Mike Jackson, the head of the British army during the
invasion, on Saturday branded Washington's post-invasion policy
"intellectually bankrupt."
