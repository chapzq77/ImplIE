Wall Street lower amid Blackstone IPO splash
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
US shares slumped Friday as interest rate jitters and fears about
mortgage failures hitting the financial sector offset the splash
from the Blackstone Group's debut on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 59.10 points (0.44 percent)
to 13,486.74 and the Nasdaq shed 10.06 points (0.38 percent) to
2,606.90 at 1420 GMT.
</P>
<P>
The broad-market Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index dropped 6.80
points (0.45 percent) to 1,515.39.
</P>
<P>
Mark Fightmaster at Schaeffer's Investors Service said the market
was under pressure as "the impact of subprime mortgages has crept
back into the picture."
</P>
<P>
He said this was highlighted by reports that Wall Street
investment firm Bear Stearns was taking out 3.2 billion dollars
in loans to keep creditors from seizing assets of its money-
losing hedge funds hit by mortgage sector losses.
</P>
<P>
"In addition, some believe that the initial public offering (IPO)
of private behemoth Blackstone Group could signal a market top,"
Fightmaster said.
</P>
<P>
The private equity firm's share traded under the BX symbol shot
higher to 45 dollars in electronic trades from 31 dollars after
the biggest IPO so far this year, raising 4.1 billion dollars for
the equity firm making its debut in the regulated stock market.
</P>
<P>
In floor trading, Blackstone shares were up 18 percent from the
offering price at 36.45 dollars.
</P>
<P>
Al Goldman, market strategist at AG Edwards, said he believes the
subprime jitters have provided an excuse to sell but that the
market needs to pause after the big runup of the past few months.
</P>
<P>
"We believe the subprime problems have been widely publicized and
thus pretty well discounted," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The brake being applied on our bull (market) is simply its own
internal dynamics and the internals are just a bit tired ... we
look for more correction over the short term."
</P>
<P>
Bonds lost ground as well. The yield on the 10-year US Treasury
bond rose to 5.197 percent from 5.163 percent Thursday and that
on the 30-year bond increased to 5.318 percent against 5.284
percent. Bond yields and prices move in opposite directions.
</P>
<P>
Among stocks in focus, Bear Stearns fell 97 cents to 144.84
dollars with investors watching how it will cope with the losses
at its hedge funds from mortgage securities holding "subprime"
loans.
</P>
<P>
Patrick O'Hare at Briefing.com said the Wall Street bank appeared
to be moving to avoid a "fire sale" of those assets.
</P>
<P>
"The mere mention of the term 'fire sale' puts the capital
markets on edge, but the notion that a loan agreement of some
sort is being worked out to prevent that is helping to calm some
of the nervousness," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Nonetheless, the Bear Stearns hedge fund situation is providing
a reality check for many investors that it is prudent to be more
risk averse than they have been recently in their search for high
yields."
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere, Archer Daniels Midland added 53 cents to 34.36 on
reports the US agribusiness group was preparing a bid for
Brazil's Cosan SA, that country's largest sugar and ethanol
producer.
