Early Clash Brewing Over Iraq Report

WASHINGTON
</P>
<P>
Senior congressional aides said Wednesday that the White House
has proposed limiting the much-anticipated appearance on Capitol
Hill next month of Gen. David Petraeus and Ambassador Ryan
Crocker to a private congressional briefing, suggesting instead
that the Bush administration's progress report on the Iraq war
should be delivered to Congress by the secretaries of state and
defense.
</P>
<P>
White House officials did not deny making the proposal in
informal talks with Congress, but they said Wednesday that they
will not shield the commanding general in Iraq and the senior
U.S. diplomat there from public congressional testimony required
by the war-funding legislation President Bush signed in May.
``The administration plans to follow the requirements of the
legislation,'' National Security Council spokesman Gordon
Johndroe said in response to questions Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The skirmishing is an indication of the rising anxiety on all
sides in the remaining few weeks before the presentation of what
is widely considered a make-or-break assessment of Bush's war
strategy, and one that will come amid rising calls for a drawdown
of U.S. forces from Iraq.
</P>
<P>
With the report due by Sept. 15, officials at the White House, in
Congress and in Baghdad said that no decisions have been made on
where, when or how Petraeus and Crocker will appear before
Congress. Lawmakers from both parties are growing worried that
the report -- far from clarifying the United States' future in
Iraq -- will only harden the political battle lines around the
war.
</P>
<P>
White House officials suggested to the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee and the House Foreign Affairs Committee last week that
Petraeus and Crocker would brief lawmakers in a closed session
before the release of the report, congressional aides said.
Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and Defense Secretary Robert
Gates would provide the only public testimony.
</P>
<P>
Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Joe Biden, D-Del.,
told the White House that Bush's presentation plan was
unacceptable. An aide to Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman
Carl Levin, D-Mich., said that ``we are in talks with the
administration and ... Senator Levin wants an open hearing'' with
Petraeus.
</P>
<P>
Those positions only hardened Wednesday with reports that the
document would not be written by the Army general but instead
would come from the White House, with input from Petraeus,
Crocker and other administration officials.
</P>
<P>
``Americans deserve an even-handed assessment of conditions in
Iraq. Sadly, we will only receive a snapshot from the same people
who told us the mission was accomplished and the insurgency was
in its last throes,'' warned House Democratic Caucus Chairman
Rahm Emanuel of Illinois.
</P>
<P>
``That's all the more reason why they would need to testify,'' a
senior Foreign Relations Committee aide said of Petraeus and
Crocker. ``We would want them to say whether they stand by all
the information in the report.'' He spoke on the condition of
anonymity because he was not cleared to speak to reporters.
</P>
<P>
The legislation says that Petraeus and Crocker ``will be made
available to testify in open and closed sessions before the
relevant committees of the Congress'' before the delivery of the
report. It also clearly states that the president ``will prepare
the report and submit the report to Congress'' after consultation
with the secretaries of state and defense and with the top U.S.
military commander in Iraq and the U.S. ambassador.
</P>
<P>
But both the White House and Congress have widely described the
assessment as coming from Petraeus. Bush has repeatedly referred
to the general as the one who will be delivering the report in
September and has implored the public and Republicans in Congress
to withhold judgment until then. In an interim assessment last
month, the White House said that significant progress has been
shown in fewer than half of the 18 political and security
benchmarks outlined in the legislation.
</P>
<P>
Several Republicans have hinted that their support will depend on
a credible presentation by Petraeus, not only of tangible
military progress but of evidence that the Iraqi government is
taking real steps toward ethnic and religious reconciliation. One
of them, Sen. John Warner, R-Va., left for Iraq Wednesday night
with Levin for his own assessment.
</P>
<P>
Petraeus and Crocker have said repeatedly that they plan to
testify after delivering private assessments to Bush. U.S.
military and diplomatic officials in Baghdad appeared puzzled
Wednesday when told that the White House had indicated that the
two may not be appearing in public. They said they will continue
to prepare for the testimony in the absence of instructions from
Washington. ``If anything, we just don't know the dates/times/or
the committees that the assessment will be presented to,'' a
senior military official in Baghdad said in an e-mail Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Senate Foreign Relations Committee aide said that, ideally,
both Crocker and Petraeus would testify before that panel. The
Senate committee and the House Foreign Affairs Committee have
also requested that Rice appear at a separate hearing but have
received no response. The spokesman for Levin said that he
expects at least Petraeus to testify before the Armed Services
Committee but would be happy to have Crocker as well.
</P>
<P>
Although the reports from Petraeus and Crocker are the most
eagerly awaited, several other assessments are also required by
the May legislation. The Government Accountability Office is due
to report on Iraqi political reconciliation and reconstruction by
Sept. 1. An independent committee, headed by retired Marine Gen.
James Jones, has been studying the training and capabilities of
the Iraqi security forces and will report to Congress early next
month. Marine Gen. Peter Pace, the outgoing Joint Chiefs of Staff
chairman, said that the chiefs are making their own assessment of
the situation in Iraq and will present it to Bush in the next few
weeks.  -0-
