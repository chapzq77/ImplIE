Fears of global slowdown buck up the dollar

NEW YORK 2008-08-06 20:41:46 UTC
</P>
<P>
The dollar climbed to eight-week highs against the euro and
seven-month highs against the yen Wednesday as fears of a global
slowdown helped the dollar continue its rally.
</P>
<P>
The dollar rose to 109.54 Japanese yen from 108.17 yen late
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile the 15-nation euro dropped to $1.5420 from $1.5473
after going as low as $1.5396, and the British pound sank to
$1.9475 from $1.9562 ahead of interest-rate decisions by the
European Central Bank and Bank of England Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The dollar gained as gloomy economic signs came in from abroad.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese government said a monthly index of business
conditions was worsening, setting off the yen decline, said
Michael Woolfolk, senior currency strategist at the Bank of New
York Mellon Corp.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the German government said industrial orders dropped
unexpectedly in June, with orders from elsewhere in Europe
leading a decline that underlined pessimism about the outlook for
the continent's biggest economy. Orders dropped 2.9 percent in
June, following a 1.4 percent drop in May, the Economy Ministry
said.
</P>
<P>
Ashraf Laidi, a currency strategist at CMC Markets, said the
decline, the seventh in a row, along with a leaked report by
German newspaper Sueddeutsche Zeitung claiming that German
second-quarter GDP likely shrunk by 1 percent, would weigh on the
European Central Bank at its Thursday meeting.
</P>
<P>
"The hawkish rancor of (ECB President) Jean-Claude Trichet is
likely going to be toned down considerably," Woolfolk said. Rate-
hike talk will be cast aside, and Britain may signal future rate
cuts, he said. "The ECB and Bank of England don't have much to
cheer about."
</P>
<P>
The ECB is expected to keep its benchmark rate unchanged at 4.25
percent, given the 4.1 percent inflation in the 15-nation euro
zone, while the BoE is expected to keep its rate steady as well,
at 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve left the benchmark U.S. federal funds rate
unchanged at 2 percent on Tuesday. Before rising inflation forced
a pause in June, the Fed had cut rates seven times since the fall
in hopes of reviving the flagging U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
Talk of the Fed hiking rates had driven the dollar higher over
the past three weeks, but Tuesday's announcement hinted that a
weak economy was still a risk, and many analysts talked down the
chance of a rate hike.
</P>
<P>
Higher interest rates abroad can push down the dollar, as
investors transfer their funds from American assets to overseas,
where they can get higher returns on their investments.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, oil futures touched below $118 a barrel Wednesday,
while gold dropped below $880 an ounce. Commodity-exporting
countries whose currencies were buoyed as long as commodities
shot higher, such as Canada and Australia, have seen the value of
their dollars eroded.
</P>
<P>
The dollar rose to 1.0477 Canadian dollars from 1.0428, circling
year highs. The Australian dollar, meanwhile, fell to its lowest
point in more than four months, to 90.62 U.S. cents.
</P>
<P>
In other New York trading, the dollar climbed to 1.0602 Swiss
francs from 1.0539 francs.
</P>
<P>
"It is not simply a dollar rally but a sell-off in the
Europeans," said Woolfolk.
