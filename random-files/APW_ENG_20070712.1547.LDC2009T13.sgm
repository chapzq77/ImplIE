Mexico captain Rafael Marquez left the team on Thursday, two days
before its playoff for third against Uruguay in the Copa America.
</P>
<P>
Marquez said he needed to rest after a demanding Spanish league
season with FC Barcelona followed by a tough Copa America, in
which Mexico's title hopes were crushed on Wednesday 3-0 by
tournament favorite Argentina in the semifinals.
</P>
<P>
"I've talked to the coach and Justino Compean (president of
Mexico's soccer federation) and have decided to leave the team
now due to physical concerns, basically tiredness," Marquez said.
</P>
<P>
Coach Hugo Sanchez said "there are players who are fresh and
ready to take Marquez's place" on the field on Saturday in
Caracas.
</P>
<P>
Marquez said following a short rest he will rejoin Barcelona,
even though his future with the club was thrown into doubt on
Wednesday with Barca's signing of Argentina defender Gabriel
Milito, who played against Marquez in Wednesday's semifinal.
</P>
<P>
"There's nothing official about my departure from the Catalan
club," Marquez said.
</P>
<P>
Barcelona reached an agreement with Zaragoza to sign the central
defender, and Spanish media reported the club will pay the 26
-year-old Milito a salary of euro17 million (US$23.4 million).
</P>
<P>
Milito on Thursday said he was pleased with the transfer but was
focused on winning the South American championship.
</P>
<P>
"Yes, I'm pleased about the opportunity I've been given," he said
in Maracaibo. "But now I'm concentrated on the cup, the final of
which is very important to me, perhaps the most important game of
my career."
