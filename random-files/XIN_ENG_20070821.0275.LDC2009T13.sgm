Om Chhay, adviser for Cambodian National Assembly President Heng

"I knew that Om Chhay died," Phnom Penh's Deputy Prosecutor Sok

Om Chhay, also president of the Bantey Meanchey Provincial

the anti-drug authority of the Interior Ministry, leading to
serious damage of his back and head, an official said on

According to Cambodian-language newspaper the Raksmey Kampuchea,
