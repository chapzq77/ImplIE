MILLWOOD READY TO ROLL AFTER SOLID REHAB START
</HEADLINE>

FRISCO
</P>
<P>
Kevin Millwood appears ready to rejoin the Rangers. Millwood
allowed just one hit in five innings Sunday during a rehab
assignment with the Double A RoughR iders at Dr Pepper Ballpark.
</P>
<P>
Millwood, who threw 56 pitches (36 strikes) and didn't factor in
the decision in a 2-1 win against the Tulsa Drillers, said his
hamstring feels fine and he expects to be on the mound for the
Rangers in Seattle on Friday.
</P>
<P>
"I felt like I was putting it where I wanted to, for the most
part," Millwood said. "I was mainly trying to make sure my pitch
count got up and my hamstring felt fine."
</P>
<P>
Millwood, who is 2-4 with a 6.62 ERA in 35 1/3 innings, injured
his left hamstring May 14 in a start against the Angels. Earlier
in May he strained the hamstring during practice. He's eligible
to come of the disabled list Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
After his first three pitches Sunday missed the strike zone,
Millwood settled down and struck out the leadoff batter . He
allowed just two baserunners on a walk and a double. He had three
strikeouts and his fastball routinely hit 90-92 mph.
</P>
<P>
"I felt a little out of sorts, but I think the biggest thing was
just getting some pitches in," Millwood said. "(My pitches) were
fine. Nothing was horrible, so that was good. I threw my fastball
wherever I wanted to, for the most part, and that's key for me."
</P>
<P>
Rangers bullpen coach Dom Chiti, who was with Millwood in Frisco,
said the pitcher proved he's healthy.
</P>
<P>
"I think he's ready to go," Chiti said. "Kevin showed everyone
that he's healthy and his leg was fine. We started seeing the
velocity, and he located (his pitches ).

Hairston homers
</P>
<P>
Rangers outfielder Jerry Hairston was 1-for-4 Sunday with a line-
drive homer to left field for Frisco. Hairston says the pain from
a bulging disk, which was pinching a nerve in his neck and put
him on the disabled list, has subsided.
</P>
<P>
" (Sunday) was probably the best I've felt in a long time," he
said. "Especially the last three at bats -- even the strikeout --
I felt great. It's just good to be back playing again."
</P>
<P>
Hairston hopes to be back with the Rangers in Seattle after
receiving a cortisone shot Tuesday and playing a game or two in
Oklahoma City.
