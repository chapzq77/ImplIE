Football:Trap door nears for Ince as Rovers crash to Wigan
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Blackburn Rovers manager Paul Ince's future hung on a thread on
Saturday after his side side suffered a sixth successive
Premiership defeat 3-0 to Wigan Athletic managed by former
Manchester United team-mate Steve Bruce.
</P>
<P>
Defeat means that Blackburn - champions in 1996 - are second from
bottom of the table and in danger of being relegated for the
second time in their Premiership history, haivng been relegated
under former Manchester United assistant manager Brian Kidd.
</P>
<P>
Goals from England international Emile Heskey, the outstanding
Antonio Valencia and Lee Cattermole wrapped up the three points
for Wigan.
</P>
<P>
Wigan took the lead in the 12th minute through Heskey, seizing on
an excellent cross from Antonio Valencia and flicking it past
England goalkeeper Paul Robinson.
</P>
<P>
Wigan doubled their lead two minutes later and this time it was
Valencia who netted as Robinson failed to clear convincingly and
Dutch defender Mario Melchiot headed on to Valencia, who took
full advantage without a Rovers player even trying to tackle him.
</P>
<P>
Ince sent on fit again David Dunn at the start of the second-half
for Morten Gamst Pedersen as he desperately searched for some
inspiration and within six minutes Rovers went close to reducing
the deficit as Christopher Samba's header went wide of the goal
from Australian winger Brett Emerton's cross.
</P>
<P>
However, Wigan went desperately close to making it 3-0 in the
57th minute as leading scorer Amr Zaki unleashed a shot from
close on the goal but it went wide.
</P>
<P>
Dunn took time to get going after a long lay-off with an Achilles
tendon injury but finally produced a shot worthy of Chris
Kirkland making a save in the 66th minute.
</P>
<P>
It was Wigan, though, who deservedly extended their lead in the
77th minute as Cattermole drove home from just inside the area
following anothe rgood piece of work by the seemingly tireless
Valencia.
</P>
<P>
Rovers did at the least have the final shot on target with Roque
Santa Cruz forcing the excellent Kirkland into a fine save.
