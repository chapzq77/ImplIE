A series of powerful tornadoes tore across the United States late
Saturday, killing at least 21 people and shattering homes and
businesses, officials and media said.
</P>
<P>
Susie Stonner, spokeswoman for the Missouri department of
emergency management, said there were 13 confirmed dead in her
state as search-and-rescue workers on Sunday searched for
survivors.

Numerous tornadoes touched down in the evening hours as the
storms ripped across Oklahoma at 35-45 miles per hour (55-70
kmh), killing seven in the area near Picher, Oklahoma, the state
department of emergency management said. Some 150 people were
injured.
</P>
<P>
The high winds ripped roofs off houses, and other homes were
crushed to kindling as the storms downed power lines, utility
poles and trees.
</P>
<P>
"In some cases, only a home's concrete slab remains," the state
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The American Red Cross has opened shelters for those affected by
the storms in Oklahoma and Missouri.
</P>
<P>
Oklahoma Governor Brad Henry declared a state of emergency in the
disaster area, and planned to visit it later Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"Our thoughts and prayers are with the people of Picher and all
of the other Oklahoma communities that have been impacted by the
latest wave of severe weather," Henry told CNN.
</P>
<P>
National Guard troops were called to shut off access to Picher.
The state said that about 6,300 homes and businesses were without
electric power, including 3,000 near Tulsa.
</P>
<P>
The storms barrelled eastward and killed one person in the
Southeastern state of Georgia in the early morning hours of
Sunday, that state's emergency management agency said.
</P>
<P>
The small town of Kite, with some 1,000 residents, was apparently
devastated.
</P>
<P>
"From what I understand it has been completely destroyed," said
department spokeswoman Lisa Janak. "It experienced significant
damage."
</P>
<P>
"Many roads are still blocked and impassable," she said. "They're
having problems with trees in the road, so these are very
preliminary estimates, but the town of Kite sustained
significant, significant damage."
</P>
<P>
Janak could not confirm whether the storm had spawned any
tornadoes.
</P>
<P>
"The National Weather Service will have to send out a survey team
to determine that for sure," she said.
</P>
<P>
Some 18,000 residents were without power in the state, Georgia
Power told the Atlanta Journal Constitution.
</P>
<P>
In February, a string of storms brought rare winter tornadoes to
the Southern states of Tennessee, Arkansas, Kentucky and Alabama,
killing 55 and injuring hundreds.
