dollars) to help defend threatened forests and called on others
to join its effort as a UN conference on biodiversity engaged top
gear.
</P>
<P>
German Chancellor Angela Merkel said her country wanted to set
down a "very clear marker" on attaining the UN's Millennium goal
of braking biodiversity loss by 2010.
</P>
<P>
"The federal government, between 2009 and 2012, will earmark an
additional amount of 500 million euros," Merkel told the meeting.
</P>
<P>
"We want to use this money in those areas where forests and other
ecosystems are under threat and to find quick solutions for
conserving them."
</P>
<P>
From 2013, Germany will stump up half a billion dollars annually,
she promised, but added, "obviously, Germany cannot shoulder this
enormous global burden alone."
</P>
<P>
The three-day "high-level" section of the conference is gathering
87 ministers, with the goal of crafting a new global deal on
preserving Earth's wildlife.
</P>
<P>
Some 6,000 representatives from 191 countries attended the
meeting, launched 11 days earlier.
</P>
<P>
Participants at the conference are hoping to establish a roadmap
towards negotiating, by 2010, an "Access and Benefit Sharing"
regulatory framework governing access to genetic resources and
sharing the benefits from their use.

<P>
The UN Convention on Biodiversity (CBD) was established at the
Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in 1992.

Scientists say that species are becoming extinct at a dizzying
rate -- between 100 and 1,000 times the natural pace of
extinction.
</P>
<P>
One in four mammals, one bird in eight, one third of all
amphibians and 70 percent of plants are under threat.
</P>
<P>
Development economist Pavan Sukhdev has handed the conference a
preliminary report in which the lost of the benefits of
biodiversity are put at 3.1 trillion dollars a year, or six
percent of the planet's gross national product.

<P>
Group of Eight environment ministers met in Kobe, Japan, earlier
this week, issuing a joing statement acknowledging the
fundamental importance of biodiversity and spelling out their
support for the Millennium Development Goal of reaching a
"significant reduction" in species loss by the end of this
decade.
</P>
<P>
Greenpeace's Martin Kaiser praised Merkel for sending "a very
strong and important signal" for reaching a strong agreement in
Bonn.
</P>
<P>
He called on other industrialised countries to pitch in, and
estimated around 30 billion euros (47.1 billion dollars) a year
were needed to finance the protection of ancient forests.
