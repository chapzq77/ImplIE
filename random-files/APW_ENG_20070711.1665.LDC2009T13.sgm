<P>
Genentech Inc., one of the world's largest biotechnology
companies, continued a positive earnings streak, posting a 41
percent boost in second-quarter profit Wednesday on sales of its
blockbuster cancer drugs.
</P>
<P>
The company earned $747 million (euro543.15 million), or 70 cents
per share, compared with profit of $531 million (euro386.1
million), or 49 cents per share, during the year-ago period.
</P>
<P>
Revenue rose to $3 billion (euro2.18 billion) from $2.2 billion
(euro1.6 billion).
</P>
<P>
The results topped Wall Street expectations. Excluding 6 cents
per share for stock-based compensation costs and 2 cents per
share related to the redemption of Genentech stock by Roche
Holdings Inc. and litigation costs, Genentech earned 78 cents per
share.
</P>
<P>
Analysts polled by Thomson Financial expected profit of 72 cents
per share, excluding stock-option costs and charges, on revenue
of just under $2.86 billion (euro2.08 billion).
</P>
<P>
The rheumatoid arthritis and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma drug Rituxan
brought in $582 million (euro423.18 million) in sales during the
quarter, an 11 percent increase.
</P>
<P>
Avastin, which treats lung, breast and colon cancer, had sales of
$564 million (euro410.09 million), marking a 33 percent increase.
Breast cancer drug Herceptin showed a 3 percent increase in sales
to $329 million (euro239.22 million).
</P>
<P>
Sales of its Lucentis drug totaled $209 million (euro151.97
million). The drug, which treats age-related macular
degeneration, was approved last June.
</P>
<P>
Costs and expenses rose 30 percent to $1.88 billion (euro1.37
billion) from $1.44 billion (euro1.05 billion). During the
quarter, the company began eight phase III clinical trials. Those
studies include Lucentis as a possible diabetic macular edema and
retinal vein collusion treatment and Avastin for a specific form
of lung cancer and as a second-line treatment for colon cancer.
</P>
<P>
For the full year, the company said it expects earnings per
share, excluding costs and charges, to range from $2.85
(euro2.07) to $2.95 (euro2.14). Analysts expect earnings of $2.91
(euro2.12) per share.
</P>
<P>
Shares of Genentech fell 11 cents to $75.82 in after-hours
trading. They rose $1.08 cents to close the regular session at
$75.93.
