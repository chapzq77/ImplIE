EU raises 2008 eurozone inflation forecast to 3.2 pct from 2.6
pct

<P>
The European Commission sharply raised its 2008 inflation
estimate for the eurozone to 3.2 percent while trimming back only
slightly its growth forecast to 1.7 percent.In February, the
European Union's executive arm had forecast that inflation in the
15 nations sharing the euro would reach 2.6 percent this year and
that growth would be 1.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
While record oil and food prices were taking their toll on growth
and inflation, financial market turmoil and a US slump were
proving to be worse than previously expected, the commission said
in its spring Economic Forecast.
</P>
<P>
In the 27-nation European Union, the commission forecast
inflation would reach 3.6 percent this year, instead of the 2.9
percent previously expected, but stuck to its estimate for 2.0
percent economic growth.
</P>
<P>
"Economic growth is moderating in the EU and euro area and the
current, imported inflationary pressures are a matter of
concern," EU Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner Joaquin
Almunia said.
</P>
<P>
The commission predicted that consumer prices growth would peak
in the second quarter and cool down over the remainder of the
year and into 2009, bringing inflation in the eurozone down to
2.2 percent next year.
</P>
<P>
Driven ever higher by record commodities prices, 12-month
eurozone inflation hit 3.6 percent in March, the highest since
the 1999 launch of the shared currency and well above the
European Central Bank's comfort level of just under 2.0 percent.
</P>
<P>
While oil prices flirt with records close to 120 dollars a
barrel, the EU executive said futures contracts suggested food
prices would rise 54 percent in the first half of 2008 before
stabilising.
</P>
<P>
However, not all was doom and gloom in the commission's report
with regional economic powerhouse Germany expected to perform
better than the last time Brussels made forecasts in February.
</P>
<P>
Europe's biggest economy was forecast to grow 1.8 percent this
year, rather than the 1.6 percent the commission predicted in
February.
</P>
<P>
However, forecasts for some of Europe's other big economies were
pared down with the French economy estimated to grow 1.6 percent
in 2008 instead of 1.7 percent, and Italian growth cut to 0.5
percent from 0.7 percent previously.
</P>
<P>
Looking ahead to 2009, the commission predicted that economic
activity would pick up towards the end of the year to about 2.0
percent in the eurozone at an annualised rate.
</P>
<P>
However, for the whole of 2009, it forecast eurozone growth would
slow to 1.5 percent while activity in the overall EU economy
would ease to 1.8 percent.
