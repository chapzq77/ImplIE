Investment group pulls out of Northern Rock race
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Investment group Olivant said Monday it had withdrawn from the
running to offer a rescue package for troubled British bank
Northern Rock, shortly before the deadline expired for bids to be
presented.
</P>
<P>
The withdrawal left a consortium led by Virgin entrepreneur
Richard Branson and a group from Northern Rock's own management
as the only parties expected to make offers.

<P>
"Olivant ... has today decided not to submit a further proposal
in relation to the stabilization, recapitalization and
repositioning of Northern Rock plc," it said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"Despite working intensively, we have been unable to formulate a
value creation proposal which meets our investment criteria
whilst also respecting (the British government's) proposed
financing terms and the interests of other stakeholders in the
company," added Olivant chairman Luqman Arnold.
</P>
<P>
Last month, Britain's Labour government unveiled plans to keep
Northern Rock in the private sector but admitted it could still
be nationalised, having lent the bank about 25 billion pounds
(33.4 billion euros, 49.4 billion dollars) in emergency funding
to keep it afloat.
</P>
<P>
Britain's Treasury, the Financial Services Authority and Bank of
England are together expected to decide on a preferred bidder by
the end of February.
