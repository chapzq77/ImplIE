NEVADA SEED CO.'S BANKRUPTCY HEIGHTENS FARM CRISIS By Sara

WASHINGTON, Feb.16 - The seed-supply company that once prided itself
on keeping the White House lawn green is in the red. When AgriBioTech,
the world's leading seller of forage and turfgrass seed, filed for
bankruptcy on Jan. 25, agriculture officials say it put farmers at an
even graver risk. The bankruptcy has already caused an estimated loss
of more than $100 million in agriculture revenue nationwide. Founded
in 1995, ABT sought to consolidate the seed industry through mergers
and acquisitions. By 1999, the company had successfully purchased 34
smaller seed distributors. For the past five years, ABT has been the
nation's main provider of alfalfa and other seeds used in crops such
as corn, soybean, wheat and other vegetables. The company has also
supplied the turfgrass-grounding for many major league athletic
facilities, and its product was even used by White House landscapers.
Agriculture officials in Washington and in Western states say ABT's
bankruptcy is having a domino effect across the country. Crop farmers,
who are already struggling nationwide, must cope without being able to
purchase seed from ABT, which could lead to even more dramatic losses.
Even the John Deere Company has been affected, reporting an estimated
$800,000 in cancelled farm equipment orders in the last two weeks.
ABT, however, says it never intended to be a provider for the seed
industry, that they wanted to quickly sell off the smaller companies -
something they had trouble doing. Last February, ABT tried to solve
their problem by hiring a new senior management group ``with expertise
in operation and integration,'' and set goals to build company
capitol, manage the acquired operations and achieve profit in 2000,
according to a company profile.

By September, ABT had reassured its growers through letters and
meetings that the company was ``healthy and solvent,'' on its way to
almost $400 million in yearly revenue.

``The bottom line is there was basically no warning,'' said Don
Schriftinson, policy director for the Wyoming Department of
Agriculture. ``They said to stick with them, and now farmers are in a
cash-flow crisis with no where to turn.''

Also being crippled by ABT's closing are the seed growers who were
selling their product to the Nevada-based company. One grower said
that nore than 1,000 seed growers indirectly contracted by ABT could
still be held responsible for delivering seed without payment for the
next two years. Of the 13 states with contracted companies, Oregon and
Washington have been hit the hardest, each seeking nearly $40 million
in contract compensation alone. Congressmen in Wyoming and Idaho have
already asked for federal assistance. In a letter to Agriculture
Secretary Dan Glickman, the Idaho delegation wrote, ``be prepared to
intervene with the appropriate emergency assistance for it will become
apparent that the effects of this bankruptcy will force large numbers
of seed farmers out of business.'' Though Wyoming farmers only lost
$4.5 in contract money, the state will eventually require nearly $20
million to help stabilize the numerous communities effected by the ABT
fiasco, according to state officials. Finding it too costly to wait
for federal decisions to be made, the Wyoming State legislature
intends to pass it's own emergency relief bill by the end of the week.
Bankruptcy proceedings could give ABT an estimated $80 million in
asset liquidation sales. But officials say that money will be used to
pay off credit debts and other loans. ``I am a seed grower and the
focus should not be 'poor seed grower,''' said Wyoming farmer Terry
Jones. ``States need to deal with their local economy now so they
won't have a huge, disastrous impact not just on their rural
communities but on the nation as a whole.''
