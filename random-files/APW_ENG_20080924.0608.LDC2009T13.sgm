Finland ' s PM calls for stricter gun laws

KAUHAJOKI, Finland 2008-09-24 12:29:04 UTC

<P>
Finland's prime minister called for stricter gun laws Wednesday
as investigators revealed that the 22-year-old gunman focused his
violence against women, killing eight female students and
shooting another in the head.
</P>
<P>
The slaughter that left 10 people and the shooter dead Tuesday
was Finland's second deadly school shooting in less than a year.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Matti Vanhanen said it was time to consider
restricting access to guns in a country with more than 1.6
million firearms in private hands.
</P>
<P>
"We need to study if people should get access to handguns so
freely," Vanhanen told reporters in Kauhajoki, 180 miles (290
kilometers) northwest of Helsinki. "I'm very, very critical about
the guns and during next few months we will make a decision about
it."
</P>
<P>
Finland has deeply held hunting traditions and ranks -- along
with the United States -- in the top five nations in the world
when it comes to civilian gun ownership.
</P>
<P>
The government also called Wednesday for an investigation into
police handling of the case. Police had questioned shooter Matti
Saari, a student at the school, a day before the attack about
YouTube clips showing him firing a handgun.
</P>
<P>
"We will obviously investigate what the foundation was for the
decision to let him keep his weapon," Vanhanen said.
</P>
<P>
An anonymous tip Friday led police to search for Saari, but they
released him after questioning Monday because police said they
found no reason to keep him in custody.
</P>
<P>
Some of the YouTube clips appeared to have been shot by another
person and police said they would question Saari's acquaintances
to find out who that was. However, police said there was no
indication that Saari had an accomplice during the shooting.
</P>
<P>
Solemnly leading his nation in a day of mourning, Vanhanen and
other ministers visited Kauhajoki, a town of 14,000 people, as
flags flew at half-staff. Grieving residents placed candles and
flowers outside the Kauhajoki School of Hospitality.
</P>
<P>
The National Bureau of Investigation said all the female victims
were students, while the two men who were killed were a teacher
and a student. Saari also shot another female student in the head
before shooting himself in the head.
</P>
<P>
That 21-year-old woman had two operations overnight but doctors
said she was in satisfactory condition Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Investigators said most of the victims were from the Kauhajoki
area, like Saari, meaning he probably knew them.
</P>
<P>
"He really went out with the intention of killing," investigation
leader Jari Neulaniemi said. "He left at home a message saying he
wanted to murder as many people as possible. He tried to shoot
fatal shots."
</P>
<P>
Police spokesman Urpo Lintula said Saari had acquired a permit
for his weapon, a .22-caliber handgun, in August.
</P>
<P>
"With this weapon and plenty of ammunition, he came into the
school yesterday morning and he also had a largish bag which
apparently had flammable liquids or something to start fires,"
Lintula said.
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said panic erupted at the school, which offers courses
in catering, tourism, nursing and home economics, as the masked
gunman entered just before 11 a.m. and started firing in a
classroom where students were taking an exam.
</P>
<P>
A video clip posted on the Internet by the alleged gunman showed
him pointing his gun to the camera and saying "You will die next"
before firing four rounds.
</P>
<P>
The rampage bore eerie similarities to another school massacre in
Finland last year in which an 18-year-old gunman killed eight
people and himself.
</P>
<P>
After that massacre, the government promised to raise the minimum
age for buying a gun from 15 to 18, but legislation was never
passed. That change would not have stopped either of the recent
school shooters, who were 18 and 22 years old.
