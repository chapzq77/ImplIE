A DOWNSIDE OF FUEL EFFICIENCY?

LOS ANGELES
</P>
<P>
America's growing love affair with energy-efficient cars is
starting to take a toll on the nation's crumbling highways and
roads.
</P>
<P>
Requiring fewer fill-ups at the pumps, the vehicles are putting a
pinch on the federal Highway Trust Fund -- the major government
funding source for highway and mass-transit projects.
</P>
<P>
And federal officials say the fund, financed by a federal tax on
gasoline, is careening toward a deficit within two years.
</P>
<P>
To be fair, federal officials say, it's not just energy-efficient
autos that are sucking the fund dry. Higher construction costs,
congressional overspending and an aging highway system are also
putting a growing strain on it.
</P>
<P>
But now a panel chartered by Congress is looking for new ways to
finance the system, and the answer could mean an increase at the
pump for consumers who already pay 18.3 cents into the fund for
each gallon of gas.
</P>
<P>
"The bottom line with the Highway Trust Fund is that spending is
at a higher level than funds coming in," U.S. Transportation
Secretary Mary E. Peters said in an interview Wednesday. "This
total dependence on gas tax isn't working anymore."
</P>
<P>
Peters also chairs the National Surface Transportation Policy and
Revenue Study Commission that is reviewing the situation and will
make recommendations to Congress in a report this year.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the commission began a two-day hearing with
California transit officials at the Metropolitan Transportation
Authority's downtown Los Angeles office to discuss the region's
needs.
</P>
<P>
Peters said one estimate shows the highway portion of the Highway
Trust Fund -- which pays for roads and bridges and uses 80
percent of the federal gas tax that is collected -- will see a
$230 million deficit by fiscal year 2009.
</P>
<P>
That doesn't mean the account will be at zero, but rather that it
won't reach levels authorized by Congress. Some in the
Congressional Budget Office believe the deficit will be even more
substantial, possibly $3 billion to $4 billion.
</P>
<P>
The second portion of the fund -- used to finance mass-transit
projects with 20 percent of the federal gas tax collected -- is
not expected to go into deficit.
</P>
<P>
Field hearings on the fund quietly began in November in New York
and Memphis, where the commission started to measure the nation's
transportation needs.
</P>
<P>
Hearings in L.A. are taking place simultaneously with ones in
Atlanta. Las Vegas is next, and the commission will conclude its
hearings after visiting Minneapolis and Chicago in April.
</P>
<P>
After the commission files its report, legislators could decide
to adopt its recommendations or use them as a guide for funding
federal projects, said Chris Bonanti, special assistant to the
administrator at the Federal Railroad Administration and staff
liaison to the commission.
</P>
<P>
Brian Turmail, spokesman for the U.S. Department of
Transportation, said commissioners are asking why all the
increased spending on road projects isn't paying off. Roads are
still congested. Traffic is getting worse.
</P>
<P>
"What we're spending isn't really getting the results we want,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
But Peters said funding also is a problem as Congress overspends
its means, and revenue for the Highway Trust Fund has slowed as
more alternative-fuel cars have hit the road.
</P>
<P>
People also aren't driving as much as they once did, she said.
</P>
<P>
Predictions of trouble with the federal Highway Trust Fund
surfaced in 2005. A report commissioned by the U.S. Chamber of
Commerce predicted that the fund would run out of money.
</P>
<P>
Later that year, President George W. Bush signed a $286.4 billion
transportation law that also established a 12-member commission
-- a mix of federal, state and business leaders -- to look for
sustainable funding options.
</P>
<P>
Paul Taylor, chief economist for the National Automobile Dealers
Association, said hybrids account for just a fraction of the car
market and could not be playing a significant role in the decline
of the Highway Trust Fund.
</P>
<P>
In 2006, 16.5 million cars were sold nationwide -- just 251,862
of them hybrids.
</P>
<P>
But Taylor acknowledged that over the years, automotive
technology has made all cars and trucks more fuel-efficient and
contributed to fewer trips to the pump.
</P>
<P>
"All vehicles are improving their gasoline mileage," Taylor said.
</P>
<P>
Jack Kyser, chief economist for the Los Angeles County Economic
Development Corp., said the national highway system has been
underfunded for years and that the problems are returning to
haunt the government.
</P>
<P>
Blaming fuel-efficient cars for the decline of money in the fund
is a distortion of reality, he said.
</P>
<P>
"There are still a lot of people out there who bought big pickup
trucks and are driving them at a rapid rate of speed," he said.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the price of construction has increased far
quicker than inflation, partly driven by a development boom in
China that has driven up the price of raw materials such as
cement and steel, said Dan Beal, managing director of public
policy for the Automobile Club of Southern California.
</P>
<P>
Beal said there are several alternative revenue options for the
fund that are likely to come under greater scrutiny in
California.
</P>
<P>
The first is to increase the number of toll roads and raise toll
prices during rush hour.
</P>
<P>
Another possibility is to charge drivers by the mile, rather than
the gallon -- similar to the way they pay for utilities.
</P>
<P>
There already is a pilot project on that option in Oregon, but
it's not clear how that might affect how much the average driver
would pay.
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, whatever solution public officials adopt will have to
involve persuading drivers that they are getting good value for
their tax dollars, Beal said.
</P>
<P>
"The public has to be convinced that what they're paying now is
being used appropriately and wisely," he said. "Nobody wants to
pay more if they don't think they're getting value for what
they're currently paying."
