DOCTOR WHO ADVANCED USE OF THORAZINE DEAD 87
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dr. Frank J. Ayd Jr., a psychiatrist who by studying his
patients' responses to early antipsychotic and antidepressant
drugs helped give birth to and nurture the field of
psychopharmacology, died Monday in Baltimore. He was 87.
</P>
<P>
The cause was complications of coronary artery disease, his
daughter Loretta M. Simpson said.
</P>
<P>
Ayd's clinical results were usually influential and sometimes
stunning. In May 1955, he reported at the annual meeting of the
American Psychiatric Association on his use of two antipsychotic
drugs, chlorpromazine, best known by the trade name Thorazine,
and reserpine. Ayd, who received the first permit from the Food
and Drug Administration to use Thorazine to treat schizophrenia,
found that many of the 300 patients he treated with the drugs no
longer needed hospitalization in a specialized setting and could
be treated in a general hospital or nursing home. He said 80
percent were usefully employed.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times reported that his finding had "profound
economic implications," because it offered a way to cut the $1
billion the nation was then spending on mental illness. It said
many patients could receive immediate treatment and avoid long-
term hospitalization.
</P>
<P>
Ayd never doubted he was treating brain diseases. He tested his
patients' psychological, neurological and behavioral responses to
new drugs, then quantified the results. This placed him at odds
with the more impressionistic traditions of psychiatry, and more
in tune with the biological approach favored by many European
researchers.
</P>
<P>
"He was one of the founding fathers of psychopharmacology in this
country," Dr. Robert L. Findling, director of child and
adolescent psychiatry at Case Western Reserve University, said in
an interview Thursday. "He was there at its inception as a
scientific area of focused research."
</P>
<P>
Ayd worked at a time when there was considerably less government
and academic regulation, and when clinicians were able to
experiment more freely with emerging drugs to find good uses for
them. Dr. Philip G. Janicak, a professor of psychiatry at Rush
University in Chicago, said in an interview that "empirical trial
and error" on real patients led to many discoveries by Ayd and
his contemporaries.
</P>
<P>
Ayd contributed to more than 50 books and wrote more than 400
articles. His "Ayd's Lexicon of Psychiatry, Neurology and the
Neurosciences" is a standard reference.
</P>
<P>
He helped start the Collegium Internationale Neuro-
Psychopharmacology and the American College of
Neuropsychopharmacology. In 1966, he established his own journal,
the International Drug Therapy Newsletter. It changed its name
last year to Psychopharm Review.
</P>
<P>
Four years after his initial study, Ayd reported on a six-year
study of 4,000 patients that indicated stronger new drugs in
higher doses were even more effective.
</P>
<P>
It emerged that the powerful antipsychotic drugs often had
powerful side effects. In an interview on Thursday, Dr. J.
Raymond DePaulo, chairman of the psychiatry department at the
Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, emphasized that Ayd was as
aggressive in investigating the side effects of psychiatric drugs
as he was in gauging their potential.
</P>
<P>
"He understood that all drugs on some level are poisons," DePaulo
said. "This wasn't theoretical for him. This was about treating
the patient with something that would help them."
</P>
<P>
Ayd also expressed concern about the many previously hospitalized
mentally ill people being released without adequate support
systems because of effective drugs. Janicak said Ayd tried to
find ways to "give a voice" to the often inarticulate mentally
ill.
</P>
<P>
As drugs emerged to treat depression, Ayd subjected them to
equally strict analysis. DePaulo said Ayd tested on his patients
one of the first tricyclic antidepressants, an early and
important class of drugs for severe depression.
</P>
<P>
Frank Joseph Ayd Jr. was born in Baltimore on Oct. 14, 1920, the
son of a pediatrician and the grandson of a pharmacist. He
graduated from Loyola College in Baltimore and the University of
Maryland School of Medicine. His residency in pediatrics was
interrupted when the Navy called him to active duty at a
veterans' hospital.
</P>
<P>
A biography prepared by the alumni association of his medical
school said Ayd treated a wide array of veterans. Some were
violent, some heard voices, some could not distinguish hot from
cold. Once a patient stuffed his clothes full of newspaper and
set himself on fire.
</P>
<P>
"He was talking to the voice, not complaining of any pain," Ayd
is quoted as saying in the biography. "He had burns on at least
20 percent of his body. It fascinated me that he had no real
sense of pain."
</P>
<P>
Ayd immersed himself in psychiatry and began giving Thorazine to
patients with delusions in 1952. The drug saved some from what
then seemed to be unavoidable lobotomies.
</P>
<P>
Ayd went on to become chief of psychiatry at Franklin Square
Hospital in Baltimore from 1955 until 1962, then left to lecture
in Europe. From 1962 to 1965, he lectured at the Pontifical
Gregorian University in Rome. He later worked at the Taylor Manor
Hospital in Ellicott City, Md., and retired in 2003.
</P>
<P>
In addition to his daughter Loretta, of Hunt Valley, Md., Ayd is
survived by his wife of 64 years, the former Rita Anne
Corasaniti; his sons Frank III, of Parkville, Md., Joseph, of
Towson, Md., Thomas, of Showell, Md., Vincent, of Cedarcroft,
Md., and John, of Timonium, Md.; his other daughters, Margaret
Reid of Towson, Va., Simpson of Umbria, Italy, Teresa Knott of
Towson, Martha Teitelbaum of Troutdale, Va., Christina Lears of
Catonsville, Md., and Rita O'Brennan of Timonium; his sisters,
Jane Morales of York, Pa., and Regina Brockmeyer of Parkville;
his brother, Robert, of Parkville; 32 grandchildren; and 38
great-grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Psychiatric Times in 2005, Ayd predicted
many better drugs would be developed, but said the challenge was
for doctors to learn to use them properly.
</P>
<P>
"Otherwise, it would be like giving a driver's license to someone
who can't drive," he said.
