Oil from damaged supertanker reaches shore in South Korea ' s
largest oil spill

SEOUL, South Korea 2007-12-08 03:56:34 UTC

<P>
Oil from a damaged supertanker has reached South Korea's western
shore, a Coast Guard official said Saturday, deepening fears of
environmental damage from the country's largest oil spill.
</P>
<P>
About 7 kilometers (4 miles) of coastline near Mallipo beach,
approximately 150 kilometers (95 miles) southwest of Seoul, has
been affected by the oil, said Jung Se-hi, a spokesman at the
Coast Guard headquarters in Incheon.
</P>
<P>
Jung said it was unclear how serious the contamination was. The
region is popular for its scenic beaches and is also the site of
fish farms, a national maritime park and is an important rest
stop for migrating birds.
</P>
<P>
About 66,000 barrels (10.5 million liters; 2.7 million gallons)
of oil gushed Friday from the Hong Kong-registered tanker after a
crane-carrying barge slammed into it. The spill was the country's
largest, involving twice as much oil as the worst previous spill
in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The accident occurred about 7 miles (11 kilometers) off Mallipo
beach.
</P>
<P>
Strong winds and prevailing currents have spread the oil slick to
an area about 1 mile (2 kilometers) wide and 10 miles (20
kilometers) in length, Jung said.
</P>
<P>
YTN television showed a contaminated beach, with some rocks and
sand stained in black.
</P>
<P>
The Coast Guard planned to mobilize 103 vessels and six
helicopters Saturday in an effort to clean it up, Jung said,
adding that the operation was expected to take at least three
days.
</P>
<P>
"We're doing our best to remove the contamination as quickly as
possible, but it will take some time to clean up the shore
because it needs to be done by hand," said Kim Woon-tae, a Coast
Guard official stationed in the region.
</P>
<P>
Kim said oil was still trickling out of the punctured tanker, but
the hole would soon be sealed completely.
</P>
<P>
Chang Geun-ho, an official of the Maritime and Fisheries
Ministry, said Friday that the extent of environmental damage
would depend on the success of the containment operation, though
he added that cold winter temperatures could help slow the spread
of the oil slick by freezing it.
</P>
<P>
The size of the leak reported by the authorities would be about
one-fourth that of the 260,000 barrels, or 11 million gallons, of
oil spilled into Alaska's Prince William Sound by the Exxon
Valdez in 1989.
</P>
<P>
The tanker, the Hebei Spirit, and the other vessel, owned by
South Korea's Samsung Corp., were in no danger of sinking, the
Coast Guard said. There were no casualties in the accident, it
said.
</P>
<P>
The tanker was at anchor and carrying about 260,000 tons of crude
oil -- about 1.8 million barrels -- to be loaded into boats from
a nearby port when it was hit by the South Korean barge which was
being towed by a small tug boat, said Kim Tae-ho, another Coast
Guard official.
</P>
<P>
The barge, which was moving from a construction site, lost
control after a wire linking it to the tug boat was cut due to
high winds, waves and currents, he said.
</P>
<P>
Kim said the Coast Guard planned to question the barge's captain
to find why he was sailing through the area despite the stormy
weather.
</P>
<P>
The July 1995 leak caused damage estimated at 73.5 billion won,
at today's exchange rates equal to US$80 million (euro55
million).
