BEREA, Ohio -- Five weeks ago, the Cleveland Browns had three
quarterbacks, but they really didn't have any.
</P>
<P>
Now, they have what could be their quarterback of the future and,
amazingly enough, it's not necessarily Brady Quinn.
</P>
<P>
The Browns are averaging 32 points per game in the five games
quarterback Derek Anderson has started. They are 3-2 in those
games and 3-3 overall heading into their bye week.
</P>
<P>
What to make of Anderson? Just a guy on a roll? The next Tom
Brady? Something in between? Anderson can be a restricted free
agent at the end of the season, so the Browns will use the rest
of the season to get a handle on what they actually have.
</P>
<P>
"He's going to continue to get better," tight end Steve Heiden
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
"That's the exciting part."
</P>
<P>
Anderson threw three touchdown passes to Braylon Edwards in
Sunday's 41-31 victory over the winless Miami Dolphins. He also
scored a touchdown and made none of the mistakes that tended to
cast doubt upon him in the preseason, causing the Browns to open
the season with the since-traded Charlie Frye under center.
</P>
<P>
"You go week to week," head coach Romeo Crennel said. "It's too
early to say he's Tom Brady or Tom Brady-like or anything like
that. He's gotten an opportunity, and he's running with it. I
knew he was capable. It's not really surprising."
</P>
<P>
And the other candidate for 'quarterback of the future' can do
nothing but watch.
</P>
<P>
"It's easier when (Anderson's) playing like that," Quinn said.
"I'm a team player."
