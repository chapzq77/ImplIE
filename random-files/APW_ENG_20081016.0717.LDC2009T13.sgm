Coal-mining Peabody Energy Corp. is reporting higher third-
quarter profit, beating Wall Street's expectations, as the miner
benefited from strong global demand and tightening supplies.

The St. Louis-based company that's one of the world's biggest
coal producers reported net income of $369 million, or $1.36
cents per share, from $32.3 million, or 12 cents per share, a
year earlier, when the company said higher acquisition-related
debt and interest costs offset an increase in revenue.

<P>
Revenue in the most recent period rose to $1.9 billion from $1.2
billion.

Analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial expect, on average,
earnings per share of 87 cents and revenue of $1.68 billion.

The company sold 66 million tons of coal, up from 62.1 million
tons.
