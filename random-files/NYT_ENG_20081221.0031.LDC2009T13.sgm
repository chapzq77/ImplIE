ARTISTIC NEIGHBORHOODS IN SWITZERLAND
</HEADLINE>

Q: I'm planning a trip to Switzerland for Christmas and New
Year's. Can you recommend some artistic neighborhoods like
Williamsburg in Brooklyn? -- Anya
</P>
<P>
A: There are a number of Swiss cities that can whet your appetite
for hip, artistic neighborhoods. An excellent itinerary can be
made of Zurich, Geneva and Bern, guided by the archived articles
on our destination guides for those cities at nytimes.com/travel.

Zurich West, a former industrial quarter of Switzerland's largest
city, was described by Michael J. Agovino, fittingly for your
question, as "not unlike Williamsburg" in "Going to: Zurich"
(April 30, 2006). "For the young and hip Swiss, as well as the
European cosmopolites who come for the weekend, it's all about
the west," he wrote. Must-sees include Lowenbrauareal in Zurich
West (Limmatstrasse 270), a converted brewery that is now home to
galleries and museums, including the Migros Museum
(41-44-277-2050, www.migrosmuseum.ch).

For a break there is Spheres cafe (Hardturmstrasse 66;
41-44-440-6622), which Agovino said is "one of the coolest and
most relaxed spots in Zurich West." Good dinner choices in the
area, he said, include LaSalle (Schiffbaustrasse 4;
41-44-258-7071) and Rosso (Geroldstrasse 31; 41-43-818-2254);
LaSalle is also recommended by Alison Langley in "What's Doing:
Zurich" (Nov. 23, 2003).In Geneva, head to the village of
Carouge, a 10-minute tram ride from the city across the Arve
River. It's friendly and picturesque, according to Natasha C.
Burley in "Finding a New Cool Geneva (Even in the Old Town)"
(Sept. 19, 2004), and "a haunt for artists and craftsmen, fashion
boutiques, small bistros and gourmet restaurants." She favorably
reviewed Au Vieux Carouge (27, rue Jacques Dalphin;
41-22-342-6498), a fondue restaurant in Carouge..

Bern's Matte district, on the southeastern tip of the Old Town,
is described by the city guide Bern-Switzerland.com as a former
"district of traders and gypsies" that is now "quaint and the
funky, where small streets are lined with interesting boutiques
and small eateries."
