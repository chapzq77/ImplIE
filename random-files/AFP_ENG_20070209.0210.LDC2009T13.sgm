Iranian nuclear negotiator to meet UN atomic agency chief by
Michael Adler
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Iran's top nuclear negotiator Ali Larijani is to meet in Vienna
Friday with the chief of the UN watchdog, Mohamed ElBaradei, an
agency spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Larijani is on his way to Munich for an international security
conference at which European countries will seek a breakthrough
in the crisis over Iran's nuclear programme, diplomats have told
AFP.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said "this is the sort of meeting that occurs
regularly," as Larijani often consults with ElBaradei, head of
the International Atomic Energy Agency, which monitors Iran's
compliance with with the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT).
</P>
<P>
ElBaradei proposed in January a "time-out" in the confrontation
over Iran's nuclear ambitions.
</P>
<P>
Iran rejects a UN Security Council resolution of December 23
which imposed limited sanctions to force it to stop enriching
uranium. ElBaradei has proposed that in simultaneous moves Iran
should suspend enrichment and the United Nations should hold off
on sanctions.
</P>
<P>
A diplomat close to the IAEA said European states would be
seeking in Munich to use informal contacts with Larijani to get
Iran "to come up with some realistic, achievable proposals" to
meet the UN demands.
</P>
<P>
The uranium enrichment uses centrifuges to make fuel for civilian
nuclear reactors but can also be used to make material for bombs.
It is at the heart of US charges that Iran is hiding work to
develop nuclear weapons. Tehran insists its programme is
peaceful.
</P>
<P>
A second diplomat said the best outcome, on the sidelines of the
Conference on Security Policy being held in the southern German
city from Friday to Sunday, would be for European Union powers
Britain, Germany and France, along with Russia and China to hold
a meeting with Iran.
</P>
<P>
"They might agree on some sort of framework or concept under
which the Iranians will pull the plug on centrifuges for a couple
of months" -- opening the door to wider talks including the
United States -- and for the Security Council to take "no action
for that period" on sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Moscow supports ElBaradei's "time-out" proposal.
</P>
<P>
But diplomacy in Munich could be stilled by the long shadow of
the United States, and perhaps hardline allies like Britain,
which reject such simultaneity and want any Iranian enrichment
pause to come first and be unconditional in order to keep Iran
from winning additional time to continue strategic fuel work.
</P>
<P>
US officials have pointed out that once Iran met its commitments
to stop such fuel work, the Security Council would suspend its
sanctions, as the resolution makes clear.
</P>
<P>
But diplomats said some European states were at least playing
with the idea of a face-saving solution along the lines of a
"time-out" that fudges the need for Iran to unconditionally
stand-down.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council could impose tougher sanctions if a report
by ElBaradei later this month shows Tehran continuing to defy the
Security Council, especially since Iran is pressing ahead with
building an underground plant at Natanz for industrial-level
uranium enrichment.
</P>
<P>
The Munich meeting gathers international leaders in a framework
that favours informal contacts.
</P>
<P>
Russian President Vladimir Putin, German Chancellor Angela
Merkel, new US Defence Secretary Robert Gates and European Union
foreign policy chief Javier Solana, who led the EU's stalled
talks with Iran, will all be at the conference.
</P>
<P>
Non-proliferation analyst Mark Fitzpatrick, of the London think
tank the International Institute for Strategic Studies, said:
"Iran will be looking for a way to escape further sanctions" but
he said that what Larijani "has to offer will likely fall short
of the Security Council's resolution for a verified suspension."
