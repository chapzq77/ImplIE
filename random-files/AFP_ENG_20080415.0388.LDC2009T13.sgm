Food price hike resulting in fewer children in school - Unicef
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The increase in food prices is leading not only to empty stomachs
but also empty classrooms in poor countries as parents send their
children to work rather than school, UNICEF warned on Tuesday.The
higher prices are making families "reduce their budget, to cut
down on education and to remove their children from school to
make them work" said Veronique Taveau, spokeswoman for the UN
children's agency.
</P>
<P>
She added that the organisation was "extremely concerned" by the
price increases.
</P>
<P>
The impact of higher food prices is particularly marked in poor
countries where 75 percent of a family's revenues go on food,
compared to rich countries where just 15 percent of a household's
income is spent on meals.
</P>
<P>
A drop in school attendance is already being observed in Nepal,
said World Food Programme spokeswoman Christiane Berthiaume.
</P>
<P>
The country is particularly vulnerable as it depends on food
imports from China and India, which are restricting exports, said
Berthiaume.
</P>
<P>
In many countries, the only warm meal children get in a day is
the meal served in school canteens, she added.
</P>
<P>
In Cambodia, the WFP was also forced to suspend its food
distribution to school canteens as its local suppliers decided to
drop their contracts with the group.
</P>
<P>
"They prefer to sell elsewhere at a higher price," said
Berthiaume.
</P>
<P>
The WFP distributes 450,000 meals a day in Cambodian school
canteens at 25 cents per week per child.
</P>
<P>
Food security has become a major concern in recent weeks as
supplies of basic commodities have dwindled in the face of
soaring demand, triggering riots and outbreaks of violence from
Haiti to Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank on Sunday said a doubling of food prices over the
past three years could push 100 million people in developing
countries further into poverty. It urged developed nations to
step up and tackle the issue.
