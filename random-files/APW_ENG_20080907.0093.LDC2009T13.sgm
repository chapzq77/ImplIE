Look out Tiger Woods, 5-year-old Drew Gray's got game.

The kindergartner had a hole-in-one -- though it doesn't count
because it was on par-3 course -- last week on the 75-yard, fifth
hole at Yorktown Golf Club. The shot was witnessed by several
family members and verified by course owner John Bethard.

Drew is the youngest player to ace a hole at the course, Bethard
said. Drew has been playing golf on family outings for two years.
He played this summer in the club's golf camp for 4-to-8-year-
olds, Bethard said.
