MICROSOFT ADVERSARY RISES INSTINCTIVELY AT YAHOO BID
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
More than a decade ago, Andrew S. Grove, then the chief executive
of Intel, aptly described the hypercompetitive mentality of
Silicon Valley in his book title, "Only the Paranoid Survive."
</P>
<P>
Now, the anxious efforts by Google, led by its chief executive,
Eric E. Schmidt, to try to scuttle Microsoft's $44.6 billion bid
for Yahoo may well seem like a bout of Valley paranoia. After
all, many industry analysts view the acquisition plan, announced
Friday, as a desperation move by Microsoft to buy a bigger stake
in the online advertising and Internet search markets, even as it
and Yahoo fade further behind Google.
</P>
<P>
The fast, forceful response from Google is a product of Schmidt's
history and personality. Schmidt, 52, had spent much of his
career battling Microsoft at Sun Microsystems and Novell, before
joining Google in 2001.
</P>
<P>
His animosity toward Microsoft has long been publicly understated
and analytic in quality. At Sun, he stood at an amused distance
from the entertaining antics of the chairman, Scott G. McNealy,
who railed against Microsoft and its leaders, Steven A. Ballmer
and Bill Gates, as "Ballmer and Butthead."
</P>
<P>
During a four-year stint at Novell, Schmidt warned that it was
foolhardy for any Microsoft rival to "moon the giant," as he put
it, and incite Microsoft's wrath.
</P>
<P>
Yet he is openly taking on Microsoft, of Redmond, Wash. "This
could be a signal that he's going to go straight at Microsoft,
including disrupting their deals," said George F. Colony, chief
executive of Forrester Research. "This looks like the beginning
of the formal war."
</P>
<P>
Whatever the outcome of Microsoft bid, analysts say, the move and
Google's countermoves represent an escalation in the
confrontation between the two companies. Google says the
Microsoft bid raises grave competitive and policy issues.
</P>
<P>
Its chief legal officer, David Drummond, said in a statement
Sunday afternoon that the proposed deal posed a threat to "the
underlying principles of the Internet: openness and innovation."
</P>
<P>
Schmidt called Yahoo's chief, Jerry Yang, to offer help, perhaps
a partnership. In Washington, Google lobbyists urged regulators
to scrutinize any Microsoft-Yahoo merger.
</P>
<P>
Microsoft's initiative toward Yahoo, according to former
colleagues, seems to have set off alarm bells for Schmidt, the
seasoned Microsoft adversary.
</P>
<P>
"Google's response looks like an overreaction, even a little
panicky, to me," said Michael Sheridan, a venture capital adviser
who worked with Schmidt at both Sun and Novell. "But for Eric,
it's as if something from your past has kicked in, and the feared
enemy from the north is at your door."
</P>
<P>
Schmidt is a computer scientist who worked as a researcher at
Bell Laboratories and at Xerox's Palo Alto Research Center before
moving into management. He is every bit as comfortable talking
about software scripting languages as he is discussing corporate
strategy. His resentment of Microsoft, it seems, stems in part
from his view that it is a triumph of market muscle over superior
technology -- a common belief in Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
Now, after a long career there, Schmidt finds himself leading a
company that has plenty of market muscle of its own, and it is
Microsoft for once that is struggling to compete.
</P>
<P>
Schmidt's concern is that buying Yahoo could put Microsoft in a
position to repeat the pattern of the 1990s, when it used its
dominance of personal computer software to wrest control of the
early Web software markets, like the ones for computer browsers
and media players, according to people who have talked with
Schmidt recently and asked not to be quoted because they were not
authorized to speak for him.
</P>
<P>
If Microsoft buys Yahoo, it will have more than an 80 percent
share in markets like consumer e-mail accounts on the Web and
instant messaging. Schmidt, they say, has warned that Microsoft
could then combine its dominance in PC software to steer users to
online software and services, and lock them into Microsoft
technology -- in a way "exactly analogous" to the company's
tactics in the '90s. Microsoft's corporate behavior led to
antitrust challenges and sanctions in the United States and
Europe.
</P>
<P>
Microsoft argues that its purchase of Yahoo would give Google a
solid competitor in the Internet search and ad markets, enhancing
consumer benefits and hastening innovation.
</P>
<P>
The Google campaign against Microsoft's bid, to some degree,
underlines the broadening competition between the two technology
giants. They compete not only in Internet searches and
advertising, where Google continues to gain market share, but
also in software.
</P>
<P>
It is an assault that is just getting under way. But Google has
begun offering Web-based word processing, spreadsheets and
presentation software as an alternative to Microsoft's lucrative
desktop programs. Google's online programs are free, or $50 a
user for companies that want technical support.
</P>
<P>
"That's the dagger at the heart of Microsoft," said Thomas R.
Eisenmann, an associate professor at Harvard Business School and
an author of the school's case study on Google. "And that's why
Microsoft is so eager to have a response. It's buying Yahoo to
become a much more vigorous competitor in search and advertising,
Google's core business."
</P>
<P>
Whether Google's concerns about Microsoft are justified is
unclear. And its protests of the deal, some analysts suggest,
amount to posturing with intent. The longer Microsoft's purchase
of Yahoo can be dragged out with regulatory reviews, they say,
the better for Google, as it gains while Microsoft's online
business remains unsettled.
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, Google raised concerns about Microsoft's use of
the most recent version of its browser to steer users to its MSN
search service. The browser, which is bundled with Microsoft's
Windows operating system, contains a small on-screen box for
searching. Google complained that the search box steered users to
Microsoft's browser as the default, and expressed its concerns to
state antitrust regulators, the Justice Department and the
European Commission.
</P>
<P>
Microsoft said it listened to concerns from Google and other
competitors, and designed the browser so that it was easy to set
and change the default search service. In June 2006, the Justice
Department concluded that the design of Microsoft's browser was
not anti-competitive. Since then, Google's share of Internet
searches has continued to climb.
</P>
<P>
For its part, Google has plenty that is proprietary. Its search
algorithms and the design, even the size, of its data centers are
trade secrets.
</P>
<P>
But the two powerful companies have different business models
that seek proprietary advantage in different places. In an
interview in November, Schmidt said he understood the comparison
but that it "rankled" him.
</P>
<P>
"Microsoft was found guilty in a federal court," he said. The big
software maker, he argued, illegally maintained its Windows
monopoly by stifling rivals. "Fundamentally, they blocked people
from entering their ecosystem."
</P>
<P>
"At Google," Schmidt added, "we had a long conversation about, if
we became a big company, how could we avoid that. There are a lot
of technical things we can do and have done. But the one that we
decided that was most important was not to trap user data. That
is important because if" you can move your data from Google, you
always have a choice to go to a competitor of Google. That is
absolutely not true in Microsoft's history."
</P>
<P>
Google is hoping that Microsoft's past will hamper its effort to
become more formidable in the online business. Regulators in the
United States and Europe can be expected to look closely at
Microsoft's propose acquisition of Yahoo and decide whether
Google is being paranoid or not.
