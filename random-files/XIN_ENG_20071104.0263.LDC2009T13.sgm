BEIJING, Nov. 5 (Xinhua)

<P>
China's first lunar probe, Chang'e-1, started braking at
perilune, which will help it slow down to enter the moon's orbit.
</P>
<P>
Instructions for the braking was issued by the Beijing Aerospace
Control Center (BACC) at around 11:15 a.m. Monday, when the probe
reached a position 200 km away from the moon.

"The first braking at perilune is another key moment in the long
journey of Chang'e-1," said Wang Yejun, chief engineer of the
Beijing Aerospace Control Center (BACC).

"The speed of Chang'e-1 reached 2.4 km per second when it arrived
at perilune, and it would likely fly away from the moon if the
braking was not conducted in time," Wang said.

China's first lunar probe, Chang'e-1, named after a legendary
Chinese goddess who flew to the moon, blasted off on a Long March
3A carrier rocket on Oct. 24 from the Xichang Satellite Launch
Center in southwestern Sichuan Province.
