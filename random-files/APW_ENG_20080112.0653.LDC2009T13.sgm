LAHORE, Pakistan 2008-01-12 17:55:49 UTC

Six Pakistani militants arrested last month were "brainwashed" by
radical clerics near the Afghan border and had been plotting
suicide attacks against military targets, an intelligence
official said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the military claimed to have inflicted significant
casualties on militants in fighting in the past few days in the
border region, an insurgent stronghold where top al-Qaida and
Taliban leaders are thought to find a haven.
</P>
<P>
The battles took place near a military camp in Ladha in South
Waziristan between Wednesday and Friday, said army spokesman Maj.
Gen. Waheed Arshad.
</P>
<P>
"The militants suffered heavy casualties, but we cannot give any
specific number on their dead," he said, without giving further
details.
</P>
<P>
The six suspects, one of whom is a retired army major with
alleged links to al-Qaida, were arrested in December in raids in
different parts of eastern Punjab province. The arrests were only
made public within the past week.
</P>
<P>
"These people were preparing for suicide attacks against the
army," the Pakistani official said on condition of anonymity
because he was not authorized to speak to media.
</P>
<P>
"We found explosives, suicide belts and maps of military
installations" in their hideouts, he said.
</P>
<P>
The suspects, who have yet to be charged, received training and
religious instruction in tribal areas near the Afghan border, the
official said.
</P>
<P>
The official said the suspects were "brainwashed" by clerics in
the area.
</P>
<P>
"We learned from them that they wanted to attack the army to
avenge the killings of fellow militants," he said. "They were
convinced that they would go to paradise after sacrificing their
life."
</P>
<P>
The detained men had been working under Ahsanul Haq, a retired
army major with alleged links to al-Qaida. Haq was the mastermind
of a Nov. 1 suicide attack on a Pakistan Air Force bus that
killed eight people in Sargodha, a city about 200 kilometers (125
miles) south of the capital, Islamabad, the intelligence official
said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, police fatally shot two suspected militants in a
shootout late Friday in Multan, a city in Punjab province, said
Fayyaz Ahmad, an area police chief. Three other suspects fled,
Ahmad said.
</P>
<P>
Ahmad said that police told the men to stop their vehicle, but
that the men had opened fire instead, wounding one of the
officers.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan, a key U.S. ally in the war on terrorism, has seen an
increase in suicide attacks in the past three months. The most
recent took place Thursday when 24 people, most of them police
officers, were killed in a blast in Lahore city, Punjab's
capital.
</P>
<P>
Opposition leader Benazir Bhutto was killed Dec. 27 in a gun and
suicide bomb attack in Rawalpindi, a city adjacent to Islamabad.
