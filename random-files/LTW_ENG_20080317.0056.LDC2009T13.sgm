China's Crackdown Wins Wide Approval From Public
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the West, the name Tibet has long evoked unspoiled Himalayan
landscapes, cinnamon-robed monks spinning prayer wheels and a
peace-loving Dalai Lama seeking freedom for his repressed
Buddhist followers.
</P>
<P>
Here in China, people have embraced a different view; they regard
Tibet as a historical part of the nation and see its sympathizers
in the West as easily fooled romantics. Thanks to government
propaganda, but also to ethnic pride, most Chinese see the Dalai
Lama and his monks as obscurantist reactionaries trying to split
the country and reverse the economic and social progress that
China has brought to a backward and isolated land over the past
58 years.
</P>
<P>
The violent protests by Buddhist monks and other Tibetans that
exploded in Lhasa on Friday, therefore, have generated widespread
condemnation among the country's majority Han Chinese. In street
conversations, Internet discussions and academic forums, most
Chinese have readily embraced the government's contention that
the violence resulted from a plot mounted by the Dalai Lama from
his exile headquarters in India.
</P>
<P>
Against that background, the Communist Party has met with broad
popular approval in vowing to crack down on the rioters -- most
of whose victims were Han Chinese -- and in qualifying the
"impudent" Dalai Lama as a "master terror maker" who has
hoodwinked the West with his appeals for peace. While the rest of
the world invokes the Beijing Olympics and advises restraint,
Chinese specialists and the public have urged the government to
move decisively -- and gamble that the Olympics will not be
spoiled.
</P>
<P>
"The riot in Lhasa was caused by the Dalai Lama," said Zhang Yun,
a professor at the government-sponsored Chinese Center for
Tibetan Studies in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
"The monks are very easily influenced by their religious leader,
so they are irrational compared to other types of people," he
added. "I don't believe any country in the world would allow
anything that would destroy social order and ruin people's lives.
There is a lot of prejudice against the Chinese government.
People believe all that stuff about the Dalai Lama, and that the
Chinese government is all wrong. But actually, the reality is not
like that."
</P>
<P>
Jorge Chiang, a stylishly dressed Hong Kong businessman on a trip
to Beijing, said he, too, believed the bloody rioting was set off
on orders from the Dalai Lama. Now, he predicted, the Chinese
government will use the violence as a reason to round up the most
prominent activist monks and "tighten its control over Tibet."
</P>
<P>
"I believe the government is capable of resolving this
situation," said a young woman walking in central Beijing on a
brilliant spring afternoon. "It's not the first time this has
happened."
</P>
<P>
An Internet commentator who identified himself as Roomx said
Buddhist monks have no more right than anybody else to torch
shops and kill the Han Chinese businessmen inside. "They are all
Chinese citizens," he added. "The monks who are connected to this
conduct have to be arrested. Otherwise, it is not in conformity
with rule by law."
</P>
<P>
Dramatizing how broadly such views are held even among the
computer-savvy young generation, similar outrage exploded on the
Internet after the Icelandic pop singer Bjork capped a concert in
Shanghai on March 2 by shouting "Tibet! Tibet!" after a song
about independence. Censorship officials huffed about how her
gesture was out of place and pledged to tighten controls over
foreign performers in China.
</P>
<P>
The Tibet Autonomous Region's local government issued an
announcement after the riots saying the Dalai Lama and his
followers instigated the violence "intending to break Tibet away
from the motherland." Their allegation reflected China's long-
standing complaint that the Dalai Lama, though he preaches
limited autonomy, in fact has not abandoned his campaign to make
Tibet and its 2.8 million residents fully independent from China.
</P>
<P>
For those with long memories in Beijing, that has always been the
situation. The Dalai Lama, now 72, led a violent uprising with
help from the Central Intelligence Agency after Chinese troops
reimposed rule from Beijing in 1950. The subversion campaign
failed, and he was forced in 1959 to flee on horseback to India,
where he has lived in exile for half a century. It was to mark
the anniversary of his dramatic flight over the Himalayas that
anti-China demonstrations in Lhasa got started last Monday.

<P>
Tibet, a 750,000-square-mile territory sitting between the
Himalayan and Kun Lun mountain ranges, was more or less part of
various Chinese empires over the centuries, paying fealty but
often too remote to be totally controlled. With the Dalai Lama as
its leader, however, Tibet governed itself as an independent
nation while China was torn by the upheavals of the first half of
the 20th century. So for Beijing officials and the public they
have educated through propaganda, the Dalai Lama is less a devout
Buddhist than a secessionist rebel.
</P>
<P>
"Now the blaze and blood in Lhasa has unclad the nature of the
Dalai Lama," said an editorial from the official New China News
Agency. "And it's time for the international community to recheck
their stance toward the group under the camouflage of
nonviolence, if they do not want to be willingly misled."
</P>
<P>
The Dalai Lama's hold on people's imagination in the West has
long irritated the Chinese government. The New China News Agency
editorial described his Nobel Peace Prize, awarded in 1989, as
"tainted" by Friday's rioting. The Congressional Gold Medal,
which injected a chill into U.S.-China relations last October,
turned out to be a "fig leaf" for the "rhetoric lama to sell his
deceitful philosophy," it said.
</P>
<P>
In any case, the Chinese government has portrayed its presence in
Tibet as beneficial for the population, citing the breakup of
traditional serfdom in the countryside, improved health care and
school construction. A Beijing-to-Lhasa train that began service
in July 2006 was designed to further accelerate economic
development, bringing in tourists and taking out minerals.
</P>
<P>
The economic development has been accompanied by an influx of Han
Chinese who, Tibetan nationalists complain, have tightened their
grip on all the economic and political levers. The Han Chinese
who were killed in Friday's rioting, for instance, were
identified as shop owners and employees singled out by Tibetans
resentful of their economic domination.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese arrivals, Tibetans and their supporters abroad say,
have submerged Tibetan culture and Buddhist traditions by drawing
the territory more closely into the rest of China. Signs along
the main street leading to Lhasa's celebrated Jokhang Temple,
they note, are just as likely to be written in Chinese as
Tibetan, and the saleswomen tend to speak Mandarin rather than
the region's own tongue.
</P>
<P>
A Chinese Tibet specialist in Beijing who spoke on condition of
anonymity because of the tensions said the situation was
inevitable as China pursues economic development of the region.
Like the American West in the 19th century, he said,
modernization of China's West in the 21st century is bound to
dilute the traditional Tibetan ways so esteemed abroad.
</P>
<P>
"China's government does not intend to destroy Tibetan culture,"
he said. "But with the economy developing, the culture will
change gradually, the same as in other places in the world."
