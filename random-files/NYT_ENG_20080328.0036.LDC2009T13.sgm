A FEW TENSE MOMENTS AS U.C.L.A. PREVAILS

The differences between No. 1 UCLA and No. 12 Western Kentucky
were far greater than their seedings. Each program entered the
West Region semifinals of the NCAA tournament with starkly
different styles.
</P>
<P>
Western Kentucky used a full-court, aggressive scheme predicated
on running and trapping. UCLA preferred a more deliberate pace,
stifling teams with aggressive half-court defense.
</P>
<P>
The clash of styles, however, ended up being a much closer battle
than the Bruins would have preferred. UCLA survived scary second-
half moments Thursday night to advance to the regional final with
an 88-78 victory.
</P>
<P>
UCLA (34-3) is on the cusp of becoming the third team to reach a
Final Four in three consecutive years since the tournament
expanded to 64 teams in 1985. The Bruins would join Michigan
State and Duke.
</P>
<P>
The Bruins will have to beat No. 3 Xavier, which advanced after a
scintillating 79-75 overtime victory against No. 7 West Virginia.
</P>
<P>
For Western Kentucky (29-7), the lopsided loss ends a dazzling
season that saw the Hilltoppers storm through the Sun Belt
tournament and into America's consciousness when Ty Rogers'
3-point heave topped Drake in overtime in the first round.
</P>
<P>
UCLA led by 21 points at halftime, exploiting its size advantage.
The 6-foot-8 sophomore forward James Keefe finished with 18
points. Keefe's career high coming into the game was eight. Kevin
Love scored a career-high 29 points and added 14 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
But UCLA struggled mightily in the second half against the
Hilltoppers' full-court pressure, which allowed Western Kentucky
to creep within four points and perpetuate UCLA's reputation as a
team that can always make a game close. That's something that
could haunt the Bruins as they advance.
</P>
<P>
Western Kentucky cut the UCLA lead to 61-57 with less than seven
minutes remaining when Tyrone Brazelton blew past Darren Collison
for a layup. The basket capped a personal 8-0 run by Brazelton.
</P>
<P>
UCLA answered with a basket from Love and UCLA ended any notion
of a threat when Josh Shipp hit a line drive 3-point shot with 4
minutes 33 seconds remaining to spread the lead back out to
68-59.
</P>
<P>
UCLA held Western Kentucky to 18.8 percent shooting in the first
half and 34.7 for the game. The Bruins built their halftime lead
with inside dominators. Love had 15 first-half points while
Keefe, who played sparingly this season, came off the bench for
seven points in 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
But the Hilltoppers trailed early and could not play catch-up,
leaving the Bruins a bit of time to breathe in the second half in
anticipation of their game against Xavier.
</P>
<P>
That game will be an intriguing matchup. UCLA will enter as a
heavy favorite despite Xavier's 30-6 record and having a list of
victories this season that includes Indiana, Virginia, Auburn,
Georgia, Purdue and West Virginia. And those are only the ones
from outside the Atlantic 10.
</P>
<P>
But the biggest question that Xavier will face heading into that
game will be whether it can score against the Bruins' taut
defense. UCLA entered the game against Western Kentucky ranked
No. 5 nationally in scoring defense. The Bruins yield only 58
points a game and coach Ben Howland's philosophy is based around
stopping the other team with a ferocious man-to-man defense.
</P>
<P>
The biggest concern that UCLA will have heading into the game is
the erratic play of Collison, the point guard. He fouled out with
four points. He turned the ball over four times and had only one
assist in the Round of 32 against Texas A&amp;amp;M, a narrow
Bruins victory.
</P>
<P>
Overall, UCLA struggled against Western Kentucky's full-court
pressure, turning the ball over 19 times.
