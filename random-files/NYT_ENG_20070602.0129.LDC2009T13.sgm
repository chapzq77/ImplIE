ALTERNATIVE CANCER THERAPIES ARE TESTED

Shark fin soup might taste good. But it won't do much for cancer.
</P>
<P>
Shark cartilage, a widely used alternative therapy for cancer,
did not help patients with lung cancer live longer, according to
the results of one of the first rigorous studies of the approach.
</P>
<P>
But two smaller studies showed some preliminary but encouraging
evidence that two other complementary therapies, ginseng and
flaxseed, might have some benefit for cancer patients.
</P>
<P>
The studies were presented on Saturday here at the annual meeting
of the American Society for Clinical Oncology, where the nation's
cancer doctors usually discuss the latest in chemotherapy and new
biotechnology drugs.
</P>
<P>
It is relatively unusual for this meeting to highlight
alternative therapies, but doctors here said that might be
changing. They acknowledge that many of their patients are taking
these supplements -- widely available in health food stores --
and asking them about them. So, they said, well-designed clinical
trials are needed to determine whether these approaches are
helpful or harmful.
</P>
<P>
"One of the most common questions patients ask me is about these
things they have snookered away in their purses and pocketbooks,"
said Dr. Bruce Cheson, a hematologist at Georgetown University,
who moderated a news conference on the studies of the therapies.
</P>
<P>
The shark cartilage clinical trial was mandated by Congress and
was sponsored by the National Cancer Institute. It tested a shark
cartilage extract being developed as a drug by Aeterna Zentaris,
a Canadian company.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Charles Lu of the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, the
trial's lead investigator, said there was reason to believe the
cartilage might work. Cartilage has been found to contain factors
that can impede the formation of blood vessels. And cutting off
the blood supply to tumors has already been proven effective with
other drugs.
</P>
<P>
But in the trial, those who received the shark cartilage extract
lived a median of 14.4 months, meaning that half the patients had
died by that point. Those who got a placebo had a median survival
of 15.6 months.
</P>
<P>
The trial involved 384 patients in the United States and Canada
with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer. The shark cartilage
extract was given as a liquid that the patients drank twice a
day.
</P>
<P>
Results were somewhat more promising, though far less definitive,
for flaxseed.
</P>
<P>
That study, led by scientists at Duke University Medical Center,
involved 161 men with prostate cancer who were scheduled to have
their prostates removed. After the glands were removed about a
month later, the tumors were studied. It was found that the
tumors of the men who had taken the flaxseed had been growing
about 30 percent to 40 percent more slowly than for those who did
not.
</P>
<P>
The ginseng study suggested that the herb might help fight
fatigue, which is common in people with cancer. The study
involved 282 patients with various types of cancer.
</P>
<P>
About one quarter of the patients who took one of the two higher
doses of powdered extract of ginseng root, either 1,000 or 2,000
milligrams a day, reported that their fatigue had become
"moderately better" or "much better." That contrasted with only
one 10th of those who took either a smaller amount of ginseng or
a placebo.
</P>
<P>
Doctors said that it was too early to recommend that patients
take flaxseed or ginseng, though they said the supplements were
not harmful.
</P>
<P>
Debra L. Barton, an associate professor of oncology at the Mayo
Clinic and the lead investigator of the ginseng study, cautioned
that many ginseng supplements do not use the Wisconsin ginseng
used in the study. And the quality and quantity of active
ingredients in the ginseng supplements can vary.
</P>
<P>
The investigators said the mechanisms of action of the flaxseed
and the ginseng were not well understood. Barton reverted to the
Chinese philosophy of yin and yang in trying to explain ginseng.
"The theory is ginseng would help the body moderate the negative
things going on," she said.
</P>
<P>
In a more conventional study presented here, researchers in
Europe found that preventive radiation therapy to the head
reduces the risk that tumors will spread to the brain in patients
with small-cell lung cancer. The treatment also helped patients
live longer.
</P>
<P>
Small-cell lung cancer accounts for 15 percent to 20 percent of
all lung cancer cases, but it is an aggressive type. Previous
studies had shown the benefit of preventive radiation therapy to
the head for patients whose tumors were concentrated in a small
area. But the new study showed the technique was helpful for
patients whose tumor had spread further into the lung or
elsewhere in the body.
</P>
<P>
Only 14.6 percent of those who got the head radiation had
symptoms from a spread of cancer to the brain a year later. That
compared with 40.4 percent in a control group. Some 27.1 percent
of the treated patients were alive a year later, twice as many as
the 13.3 percent of the control group.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Roy Herbst, a lung cancer specialist at the M.D. Anderson
Cancer Center who was not involved in the study, said the
findings would "change the standard of care almost immediately."
