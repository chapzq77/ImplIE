<P>
Baseball players looking to harass Cuban umpire Yanet Moreno
don't scream insults or burst from the dugout to kick dirt.
</P>
<P>
Those who really want to get under her skin propose.
</P>
<P>
"Beautiful," they call playfully. "I'll marry you," they say.
</P>
<P>
Moreno is the only Cuban female umpire to crack the National
Series, the island's major professional league. She worked her
first game in December at the start of the most recent season.
</P>
<P>
"The crowd applauded, the players congratulated me," the 32-year-
old umpire said recently. "I wasn't nervous, just excited because
getting to that level was like a dream."
</P>
<P>
Ariel Pestano, a catcher for Villa Clara and for Cuba's national
team, said Moreno wields even greater authority on the baseball
diamond than her male counterparts.
</P>
<P>
"We have to respect her as an umpire and as a woman," he said.
</P>
<P>
No woman has umpired an American major league regular-season
game. Ria Cortesio works in Double-A ball and became the first
woman in nearly 20 years to work an exhibition in March, when she
called a game between the Arizona Diamondbacks and Chicago Cubs.
</P>
<P>
Moreno umpired 90 games last season in Cuba's top league,
including the playoffs, during which she worked quarterfinal and
semifinal series. The baseball season in Cuba runs from December
through April.
</P>
<P>
"The key is to assert authority without abusing it," she said.
</P>
<P>
Moreno sometimes works behind the plate, sometimes on the bases.
Like their U.S. counterparts, Cuban umpires rotate positions.
</P>
<P>
She played third base and shortstop and often batted cleanup as a
youngster. Moreno became an umpire in part because of her
frustration at not being able to play in organized leagues.
</P>
<P>
"Since I was little, I played with the boys in Alamar," she said,
referring to the crowded Havana neighborhood where she grew up.
"My father would punish me, but I kept it up, anyway."
</P>
<P>
Cuba has a women's baseball team, but Moreno was too old to join
when it was created. Only players 24 and under can participate.
</P>
<P>
She began her career umpiring softball, then moved on to youth
baseball games. She eventually enrolled in the National Umpire
School in Villa Clara, 220 miles (350 kilometers) from the
capital. She is not scheduled to graduate for a few weeks, but
already has a season of National Series experience.
</P>
<P>
Moreno's story has inspired other women to try their hands at
umpiring: Thirty plan to attend the national school when a new
round of classes begins in September. Not all of them are likely
to be accepted to the very selective National Series, however.
</P>
<P>
"She knows how to command respect on and off the field," said
Erasmo Torres, an umpire who will graduate with Moreno.
</P>
<P>
Moreno, who hopes to become certified for international
competition in Cuba after graduating from umpire school, said she
still considers every game she works a learning experience.
</P>
<P>
"The important thing is doing something you love and doing it
with all your heart," she said. "The rest comes on its own."
</P>
<P>
Moreno conceded that she made two errors in judgment out of all
the National Series games she worked last season. Even when she
makes a mistake, Moreno said with a smile, players' reactions are
more mischievous than angry.
</P>
<P>
Yes, Moreno is single. But, no, she has yet to accept an on-field
marriage proposal.
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot," she said. "I don't remember them all."
