BEIJING, April 19 (Xinhua)
</P>
<P>
China's cultural authorities are introducing a national
qualification program for actors, singers and dancers.
</P>
<P>
The program, expected to start later this year, is open to all
current and aspiring performing artists, said Guo Wei, an
official with the Center of Cultural and Artistic Talents (CCAT)
with the Ministry of Culture.
</P>
<P>
"We hope the qualification will provide an authentic reference
for art troupes and organizations in evaluating staff and
recruiting new actors, singers or dancers," said Guo.
</P>
<P>
Sources with the CCAT said the Ministry of Culture and the
Ministry of Labour and Social Security have been planning the
program for more than four years.
</P>
<P>
"The purpose of such a program is to improve the professional
level of China's art circles and discover more talented artists,"
said an official with the CCAT, who declined to be named.
</P>
<P>
The program would consist of two parts: a performance and a
written test of professional knowledge.
</P>
<P>
Guo said the program is currently operating on a voluntary basis.
"It is not compulsory now, but we hope it could be widely
recognized in the future so that it could become authoritative."
