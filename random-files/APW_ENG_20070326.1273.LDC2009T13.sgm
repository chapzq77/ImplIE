Sylvia Straus Heschel, a pianist and the widow of the prominent
Jewish theologian Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel, died Monday at
the age of 94, her daughter said.
</P>
<P>
Heschel died in her Manhattan apartment, according to her
daughter, Susannah Heschel.
</P>
<P>
Abraham Joshua Heschel taught Jewish ethics and mysticism at the
Jewish Theological Seminary in New York, where he combined deep
scholarship with a strong moral passion that led him to march for
civil rights with the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and to oppose
the Vietnam war.
</P>
<P>
Sylvia Straus was born in Philadelphia and grew up in Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
Susannah Heschel said her parents met during World War II in
Cincinnati, where her mother was studying piano with the Polish-
born concert pianist Severin Eisenberger and her father, a
refugee from Nazi-occupied Poland, was teaching at Hebrew Union
College.

<P>
"They were both at a dinner party and my mother was asked to
play," said Susannah Heschel, a professor of Jewish studies at
Dartmouth College. "She played and he fell in love with her."
</P>
<P>
Abraham Joshua Heschel and Sylvia Straus moved separately to New
York, he to teach at the Jewish Theological Seminary and she to
study with Eduard Steuermann, a pianist and composer. They met
again and married in 1946.
</P>
<P>
Sylvia Straus Heschel read her husband's speeches before he
delivered them and traveled widely with him, their daughter said.
The couple attended King's 1968 funeral together and traveled to
Italy in 1971, where they had a private audience with Pope Paul
VI.
</P>
<P>
Heschel continued to play the piano after her marriage,
practicing every day and giving lessons and occasional recitals.
</P>
<P>
She attended to her husband's papers after his death in 1972. "He
was always a living presence in our home," Susannah Heschel said.
