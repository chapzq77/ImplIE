Pakistan nuclear expert home from hospital: report
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Disgraced Pakistani scientist Abdul Qadeer Khan, who passed
nuclear secrets to Iran, North Korea and Libya, has returned home
from hospital after a suspected infection, state media said
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Khan, the father of Pakistan's nuclear weapons programme,
underwent cancer surgery in September 2006 and was hospitalised
on Wednesday after he complained of fever and low blood pressure.
</P>
<P>
"Dr Khan was shifted to his residence after gaining significant
improvement in his health," the official Associated Press of
Pakistan said quoting unnamed sources.
</P>
<P>
"Further treatment as required would be provided to Dr Khan at
his residence," the sources told APP.
</P>
<P>
An army statement Wednesday said Khan had been in good health
since he was diagnosed with prostate cancer but that on Tuesday
"he complained of weakness and was provided immediate medical
treatment at home."
</P>
<P>
Khan fell from grace after he publicly confessed in February 2004
to proliferating nuclear secrets.
</P>
<P>
He was immediately pardoned by President Pervez Musharraf. But
while not officially under detention, Khan has since been
forbidden from leaving his house in an upscale area of the
capital Islamabad.
</P>
<P>
Musharraf has refused to allow international investigators to
question Khan on the extent of his proliferation activities,
saying that Pakistani authorities are capable of the task.
