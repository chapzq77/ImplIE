Champ Car ushers in a new era with the standing start

Justin Wilson admits he's going to have to pay a bit more
attention now that Champ Car has adopted the standing start.
</P>
<P>
"I saw the lights go out and I thought, 'I'm meant to do
something now,'" he joked after the inaugural race to use the
start. "I have to work on my reactions."
</P>
<P>
Champ Car traditionally has used rolling starts, the generally
accepted practice in American racing where the cars already are
moving and gaining speed when the green flag is thrown.
</P>
<P>
But Sunday at Portland, the series introduced standing starts --
the Formula One standard -- where the drivers start from a dead
stop on a grid. When the last of a bank of lights above the track
goes out, the drivers take off.
</P>
<P>
"Once all the red lights go out, you drop your clutch and go, and
that's the start," said Wilson, who had the pole for the race.
"It's quite a buildup in tension because you have a few moments
where it's very quiet and nothing's happening and then all of the
sudden everyone's on full throttle and they drop their clutch."
</P>
<P>
Champ Car had wanted to use standing starts at the beginning of
the season, but it was delayed for further testing until the
Grand Prix of Portland, the fourth race of the season.
</P>
<P>
The move toward standing starts got a mixed reaction from
drivers. Points leader and three-time defending series champion
Sebastien Bourdais was especially vocal with concerns that
drivers could stall at the start, setting up rear-end accidents
all over the grid.
</P>
<P>
"It's a fine line between the perfect start and a total
disaster," he said.
</P>
<P>
Many drivers already had experience with the procedure. The Champ
Car's developmental Atlantic series introduced standing starts
last season, so rookie Graham Rahal knew what he was doing, for
the most part.
</P>
<P>
"It's much more difficult to do the starts in Champ Car because
there's so much more power," Rahal said. "It's hard to put the
power down on these cars as it is. In third gear coming out of a
corner it can be hard to do. So doing it from a stop is a tough
thing, especially when it is wet."
</P>
<P>
Fellow rookie Robert Doornbos brought in perspective from two
seasons with Formula One.
</P>
<P>
"In Formula One the computers control the standing start, so the
driver has no excuse if he messes up the start," explains
Doornbos. "Here it is all driver. If you mess up, you stall and
have a big problem. I did three or four and it went quite well.
It is just finding a strategy that works for you."
</P>
<P>
Despite the concerns, the start at Portland International Raceway
went smoothly -- even though heavy rains earlier in the race
weekend briefly had Champ Car considering whether to go back to
the rolling start.
</P>
<P>
"I'm just happy my dark visions didn't happen and nobody stalled,
which is good," said Bourdais, who won at Portland. "It doesn't
mean it's never going to happen. It means I was a little more
pessimistic than the truth. Definitely put on a good show."
</P>
<P>
Cleveland will be the next chance for fans to see the standing
start, which Champ Car is expected to use the remainder of the
season.
</P>
<P>
But many drivers say they'd like the series to keep rolling
starts in the mix, too.
</P>
<P>
"I'm not sure which I prefer. I like doing them both," Wilson
said. "I'd like to see a mixture of both throughout the season. I
think that's the best way. To master both skills is the best
thing for the drivers."
