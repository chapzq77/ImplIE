CNN and Michael Moore trade angry accusations over `Sicko '
accuracy

NEW YORK 2007-07-16 21:25:15 UTC

"Sicko" filmmaker Michael Moore called a truce Monday in his
weeklong fight with CNN that flared when the network accused him
of misstating facts in his popular documentary about the health-
care system.
</P>
<P>
Moore had promised the network over the weekend that "I'm about
to become your worst nightmare," leading CNN to post on its Web
site a remarkably lengthy response to his accusations.
</P>
<P>
Moore noted in an interview Monday that CNN had admitted to two
mistakes in its reporting on "Sicko" and that he is willing to
move on.
</P>
<P>
"I trust the intelligence of the American people," Moore told The
Associated Press. "I don't think there's a whole lot more to do
with this other than I and others are going to be a lot more
skeptical with what I see on CNN."
</P>
<P>
CNN, in its statement, noted that it has given Moore multiple
opportunities to discuss his concerns about the report on the
air.
</P>
<P>
"It's ironic that someone who has made a career out of holding
powerful interests accountable is so sensitive to having his own
work held up to the light by impartial journalists, as we did in
our examination of `Sicko,'" CNN said.
</P>
<P>
Shortly before Moore appeared for an interview with CNN's Wolf
Blitzer last week, the network ran a report by Dr. Sanjay Gupta
that had done some fact-checking on Moore's movie. Gupta's report
made Moore furious, leading to a contentious segment with Blitzer
and a debate with Gupta on "Larry King Live" later in the week.
</P>
<P>
Gupta addressed several statistics in "Sicko" before concluding:
"No matter how much Moore fudged the facts -- and he did fudge
some facts -- there is one thing everyone can agree on: the
(health care) system here should be far better."
</P>
<P>
In Gupta's report, CNN had said that Moore had reported that Cuba
spends $25 (euro18) per person for health care. In fact, the
movie estimates Cuba's spending at $251 (euro182) per person. CNN
blamed a transcription error for its mistake and apologized for
it on and off the air.
</P>
<P>
The network accuses Moore of "cherry-picking" numbers from
different academic studies to make his arguments stronger. CNN
said it believes in essentially comparing apples with apples.
Moore said he tried to use the most recent data available.
</P>
<P>
Moore was also angry that Gupta interviewed Paul Keckley, who
works for the Deloitte Center for Health Solutions, as a critic
of "Sicko." Moore said Deloitte's chairman is Tommy Thompson,
President George W. Bush's former health and human services
secretary, and that Keckley had made political contributions to
Republican candidates and organizations.
</P>
<P>
The second mistake came not in Gupta's original report -- where
Keckley was correctly identified as representing Deloitte -- but
in an on-air debate where Gupta claimed Keckley was working for
Vanderbilt University.
</P>
<P>
"His only affiliation is with Vanderbilt University," Gupta said.
"We checked it, Michael. We checked his conflict of interest. We
do ask those questions."
</P>
<P>
While CNN noted Moore was correct in pointing out Keckley had
left Vanderbilt last year, it said Keckley's comments were
factual and descriptive. Deloitte says it does not have a
political agenda.
</P>
<P>
In other instances, CNN said Moore appeared to be creating a
fight where none really existed. The network said it was
comfortable letting viewers judge for themselves.
</P>
<P>
Moore said he believed it was important for him to let people
know his side. "In the report they say that I fudged the facts,"
he said, "and they didn't find a single fact that I fudged."
