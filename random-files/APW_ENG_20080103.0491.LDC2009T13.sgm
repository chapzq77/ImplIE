Kenya's Attorney General Amos Wako called Thursday for an
independent body to verify the vote tally from a disputed
presidential election that has sparked violence across the
country.

Kenya's electoral commission had named President Mwai Kibaki
winner of the Dec. 27 vote, but rival Raila Odinga alleges fraud
and says the vote was rigged. Foreign observers have questioned
the vote count, as has the chief of the nation's electoral
commission.

"Because of the perception that the presidential results were
rigged, it is necessary ... that a proper tally of the valid
certificates returned and confirmed should be undertaken
immediately" by an independent body, Wako said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The dispute has led to political violence, as well as ethnic
clashes between Kibaki's Kikuyu group and Odinga's Luo. The
independent Kenya Human Rights Commission and the International
Federation for Human Rights said in a joint statement that more
than 300 people had been killed nationwide since Dec. 27, and the
Norwegian Refugee Council estimated more than 100,000 people have
had to flee their homes
