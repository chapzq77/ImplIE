MOSCOW, March 13 (Xinhua)
</P>
<P>
More than 300 terrorist attacks were prevented in Russia last
year, the head of the Federal Security Service (FSB) said on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
FSB chief Nikolai Patrushev said the plans for the attacks were
detected by the country's new anti-terrorist system.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot guarantee that every terrorist attack in the country
will be prevented, but the efficiency of the work to prevent them
has significantly increased," FSB chief Nikolai Patrushev was
quoted by the Itar-Tass news agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
More than 300 terrorist acts were thwarted in the past year
alone, said Patrushev, who also heads the National Anti-terrorist
Committee.
</P>
<P>
"An integral state system for the struggle against terrorism has
been created," he said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking about the recent warning about possible terrorist acts
in Russia, Patrushev said, "Even though this information has not
got confirmation, we have succeeded in averting terrorist acts on
which we had our own information."
</P>
<P>
Russian security forces were put on alert in January after
authorities received information from "foreign partners" pointing
to a terrorist plot to attack the country's public transport
system. No such attacks occurred.
