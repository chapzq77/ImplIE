Food price hike threatens food security in South Africa

JOHANNESBURG, Feb. 28 (Xinhua)
</P>
<P>
Rising food prices continue to threaten South Africa's household
food security, the National Agricultural Marketing Council said
on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Senior economist Tema Nkgasha Pieter said although food prices
had risen at a slower rate in January compared to December, from
January 2007 to January 2008 the Consumer Price Index for Food
was 13.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
"The good news is that this is 0.1 percent lower than the CPI-
Food reported in December 2007 that showed a year-on-year
increase of 13.5 percent," he said.
</P>
<P>
Food categories making the largest contribution to this increase
include grain products, milk, cheese and eggs, fats and oils,
fruits and nuts and vegetables.
</P>
<P>
Staple food items continue to increase at a relatively high rate.
Brown bread increased at 16.21 percent and white bread at 19. 92
percent year-on-year.
</P>
<P>
The prices of a 5-kg bag of super and special maize meal
increased by 22.29 percent and 28.00 percent respectively, year-
on- year.
</P>
<P>
The price of diary products on average increased by about a
third, and vegetable products by just over a third.
</P>
<P>
Meat products increased at a much slower rate that most other
food products.
</P>
<P>
"The increase in grain prices was mainly due to pressure on
international and domestic grain stocks, while the increases in
vegetable prices can be largely attributed to climate events,"
said Pieter.
</P>
<P>
According to the medium term outlook, agricultural commodity
prices would remain high but stable.
</P>
<P>
Exchange rate fluctuations and climate events could change this
situation however.
</P>
<P>
Consumers were becoming risk averse because of pessimism around
economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Demand for high-valued ready-to-eat and takeaway types of food
was expected to decline.
</P>
<P>
Pieter said the steep rise in food prices could potentially
decelerate.
</P>
<P>
This would be due to slower growth in consumer expenditure,
favorable climatic conditions improving production levels and the
potential stabilization of international grain, oilseed and
livestock markets.
