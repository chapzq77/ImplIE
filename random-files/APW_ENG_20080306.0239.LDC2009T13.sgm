Being shackled to a rock by your father as a 6-year-old in
98-degree heat might not be a part of a typical family vacation
in the Bahamas -- but April Yvette Thompson didn't have a typical
family.
</P>
<P>
In "Liberty City," a powerful and compelling new one-person show
now on view at off-Broadway's New York Theatre Workshop, the
magnetic Thompson takes us on a tour of her girlhood in the
mostly black Miami neighborhood Liberty City. Through a
wonderfully varied cast of characters we are introduced to a
singular clan -- and a singular period in history.
</P>
<P>
Thompson embodies each person completely and seamlessly
transitions from one to another, thanks to sensitive direction by
co-author Jessica Blank. Never changing her casual clothes, she
uses accents and mannerisms to portray her parents, her aunt
Valerie, her adoptive grandmother Carolyn and herself. The
audience gets to know and care about each individual through
Thompson's strong, specific characterizations.
</P>
<P>
Brought up in an activist household by a black mother and a
Bahamian-Cuban father, young April grows up in the 1970s learning
about African heroes, community involvement and the shameful
legacy of slavery. Her father, Saul, is a tenacious community
organizer who serves on the city council and teaches April to
stand up for herself and always speak her mind.
</P>
<P>
In Saul, there exists "the expectation of good," as his wife Lily
says. Despite his later failings, his fight for justice is the
moral center of this production.
</P>
<P>
The revolutionary spirit binding Thompson's family begins to
splinter when Saul is removed from the city council for demanding
that corporate chains hire blacks in black neighborhoods. He
starts an affair and moves in with his girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
Lily turns to a "cult church" and drags April along to knock on
doors on Saturday mornings. April's fractured family mirrors the
fragmentation of the neighborhood caused by a lack of jobs and
the prevalence of crack.
</P>
<P>
The simmering resentment boils over into the Miami riots of 1980
-- sparked by a not guilty verdict for four white policeman
accused of beating Arthur McDuffie, a black man, to death. These
riots seem all the more terrifying as seen through April's 11
-year-old eyes as she struggles to get herself and her brother
home from school through streets filled with chaos.
</P>
<P>
Antje Ellerman's evocative set includes Carolyn's kitchen, Saul
and Lily's living room and a tiny piece of Valerie's condo, with
a backdrop of chain link fence. Behind all this is the
Brotherhood Supermarket, complete with a painting of Martin
Luther King. We also get a tiny sliver of beach with a rusted
shackle. Above the stage are wide screens for Tal Yarden's
projections of Liberty City skylines, archival footage of the
riots and the ocean surrounding the rocky island of Eleuthera, in
the Bahamas.
</P>
<P>
In that last location, Saul is teaching April about her
ancestors. They were slaves who were left chained to rocks in the
open air; if they survived, they were sent on to work in America.
</P>
<P>
These themes of survival and self-knowledge provide an apt ending
to this exceptionally stirring and vivid tribute to a family and
a time.
