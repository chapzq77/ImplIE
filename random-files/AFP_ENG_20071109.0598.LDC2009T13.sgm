Philippine merchandise exports rose 4.7 percent to 4.37 billion
dollars in September from a year earlier despite a drop in the
electronics sector, the National Statistics Office (NSO) said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Shipments of electronics, which accounted for 60.7 percent of
total exports in September, were down by 0.2 percent to 2.656
billion dollars compared to the same period last year, the NSO
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
However exports of cathodes, woodcraft and furniture, automobile
wiring harnesses, petroleum products, coconut oil and bananas all
had double-digit rises in the same period, it said.
</P>
<P>
Export earnings in the first nine months of the year stood at
37.2 billion dollars, up 4.9 percent from the same period in
2006, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The strong performance was an improvement from August, when
exports fell by four percent.
</P>
<P>
The data showed the drop in electronics exports was offset by
growth in other areas, said David Cohen, director of Asian
economic forecasting at Action Economics in Singapore.
</P>
<P>
"The 4.7 percent growth is consistent with the moderate uptrend
in exports," he said.
</P>
<P>
The United States remained the country's biggest export market,
buying 17 percent of the total or 741.8 million dollars in
September. However this was a 10.4 percent decline from the same
period last year.

<P>
Japan was second, with 14.3 percent of total exports or 625.58
million dollars. This was a 3.6 percent decline from the same
period last year.

Hong Kong was in third place with 13.7 percent of the total or
598.5 million dollars. This was a 67.2 percent increase from last
year.
