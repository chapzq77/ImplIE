DeGeneres Sends Autistic Siblings and Helpers to Disney World
</HEADLINE>

"They were so happy," Rospars Keffer said.
</P>
<P>
Rospars Keffer, 37, her husband, Michael Keffer, 44, and their
children -- Megan, 9; Abbie, 7; and Riley, 4 -- returned to their
Long Island home Tuesday from a five-day, four-night trip,
courtesy of "The Ellen DeGeneres Show."
</P>
<P>
The vacation was the family's first. They hadn't been able to
afford to take along teachers who would help with the kids.
</P>
<P>
"You have to even the numbers. It has to be one on one,"  Rospars
Keffer said.
</P>
<P>
About a year ago, Michael Keffer's sister, Wendy Heaton, sent an
e-mail asking DeGeneres to consider the Keffer family if she
were to dedicate a show to a deserving family.
</P>
<P>
"I would love to see something really good happen for this
family," wrote Heaton, 38, of Glen Allen, Va.
</P>
<P>
In January, the comedienne surprised Heaton and Rospars Keffer
with a phone call during a taping of the show, telling them she
would provide a trip for both families. "It's amazing what you're
doing, and Julie, it's wonderful that you stay so positive,"
DeGeneres said.
</P>
<P>
The show also paid for two teachers to go along: school
psychologist Christie Schrank, who has worked with all three
kids, and behavior analyst Kim Halter, who works with Abbie.
</P>
<P>
Meals were paid for by Disney, which also let the Keffer family
spend one night at the  Cinderella Castle Suite, replete with a
butler. "You couldn't buy this trip even if you wanted to,"
DeGeneres said.
</P>
<P>
"It really was incredible," Rospars Keffer said.
</P>
<P>
During the trip, the family went on rides, interacted with
characters at meals, lounged at the hotel pool and spent time
with the Heaton family and other relatives who also went along.
</P>
<P>
Megan, who can answer questions when she can choose among
answers, said she liked Magic Kingdom more than EPCOT and Big
Thunder Mountain Railroad more than Space Mountain.
</P>
<P>
For Riley, who is conversational, the monorail was the best part
of the trip.
</P>
<P>
Although Abbie, who does not have functional language skills, had
difficulty getting through the dark and confined waiting line
areas, Rospars Keffer said she loved the roller coasters.
</P>
<P>
"The faster and the scarier it was," she said, "Abbie liked it
more."
</P>
<P>
When a kid became irritable, either Halter or Schrank led them
away so the family could enjoy the moment.
</P>
<P>
"The teachers were the element that changed the vacation from
good to great,"  Michael Keffer said.
</P>
<P>
His wife agreed, saying "We said it will be hard to go back after
this."
