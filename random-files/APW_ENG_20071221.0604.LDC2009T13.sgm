French aid workers will argue international law protects them
from charges

Six French aid workers on trial on kidnapping charges in Chad
were trying to save children they believed to be Darfur orphans,
and therefore cannot be charged under international law, their
lawyers said Friday moments before the trial began.
</P>
<P>
"We shall argue for an acquittal. Evacuating children in danger
is provided for under the Geneva Convention, and those who
evacuate them can face no criminal liability," said Celine
Lorenzon. The defense team then began the trial by presenting a
petition to nullify the proceedings against the aid workers.
</P>
<P>
The six, who work for the French charity Zoe's Ark, face 20 years
in prison with hard labor if they are found guilty of trying to
kidnap 103 African children last October. The French say the
children had been orphaned by the conflict in the neighboring
Sudanese region of Darfur, and that they had arranged for French
families to care for them. But subsequent investigations revealed
that most of the children were Chadians with living parents or
adults they regarded as parents.
</P>
<P>
Gilbert Collard, another defense lawyer, said that the accused
will argue, "they did not come here to do harm, but to apply the
legal doctrine of saving lives at any price. They admit that they
did not follow the usual methods of humanitarian aid."
</P>
<P>
Collard insisted that the defense team had "all the evidence to
show that it was not kidnapping but a desire to save children in
a humanitarian context."
</P>
<P>
The aid workers, from a group called Zoe's Ark, have been on a
hunger strike since earlier this month to draw attention to the
case, saying they feel abandoned by the French government.
Collard had said Thursday his clients were "very tired, very
depressed, very discouraged. The hunger strike has made them very
weak and the situation is really tragic."
</P>
<P>
The parents of many of the children say that they were told their
children would be going to school in Chad, and there was no
mention of a trip to France. Other children said they were lured
away from their families with sweets. The aid workers also
reportedly applied fake blood and bandages to the children,
although none of them had been wounded, in preparation for a
planned flight to France. Chadian police stopped their convoy of
all-terrain vehicles on its way to the airport with the children
on Oct. 25, and the six have been jailed since then in a case
that has drawn wide attention, sparked anti-French demonstrations
here and created diplomatic tensions between Chad and France.
</P>
<P>
In Paris Friday, Jean-Marie Bockel, a junior minister for
relations with French-speaking nations, told France's LCI
television officials "at the highest levels" in France and Chad,
including the presidents of the two countries, were discussing
the case with the aim of bringing the six to France quickly
following the trial.
</P>
<P>
A France-Chad agreement allows for citizens of one country
convicted in the other to serve sentences at home. Chadian
officials, however, have argued that the agreement only applies
in cases where it is not clear where an offense was committed, so
the Zoe's Ark case does not fall under it.
</P>
<P>
Bockel said that while France was working extremely hard on
behalf of its citizens, it was taking care not to create
"concerns and misunderstandings related to the question of
(Chad's) sovereignty, which could complicate matters."
</P>
<P>
Three Chadians and one Sudanese refugee have also been charged
with conspiracy. Some Chadians have expressed anger that the
African prisoners may be judged by a harsher standard since they
have no European government to intervene on their behalf. Eleven
other foreigners -- three French journalists who had been
reporting on the planned evacuation and seven Spanish flight crew
members and a Belgian pilot hired to fly out the children -- have
been released and flown home.
