Ebola toll in Uganda rises to 23: health official
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An Ebola patient died in western Uganda on Friday, bringing the
toll to 23, an official said, amid fears that the virulent strain
had spread to the eastern part of the country.
</P>
<P>
The patient died in Bundibugyo district, the outbreak's epicentre
where hundreds are under observation for possible infection, said
Sam Okware, a health ministry official heading the battle against
the disease.
</P>
<P>
"So far the strain has infected 104, of which 23 have died,"
Okware said, adding that signs of the deadly microbe, which first
surfaced in Bundibugyo in September, had appeared near Lake
Victoria and the near the Kenyan border in the country's eastern
region.
</P>
<P>
"We are investigating cases in Mbale (near the Kenyan border),
where one man has died and in Masaka (near Lake Victoria), where
two fishermen have symptoms similar to those of Ebola," he added.
</P>
<P>
The health ministry said teams were also probing cases in western
Kanungu and Kasese districts and northwestern Adjuman district
for possible Ebola infections.
</P>
<P>
Spread by body fluids, the blood-borne disease, Ebola was named
after a small Democratic Republic of Congo river where it was
discovered 1976 and in Sudan later the same year. Other outbreaks
have been recorded in Ivory Coast, Gabon and Uganda.
</P>
<P>
In the previous outbreaks, the disease struck with initial
ferocity causing massive fatalities then faded away months later
without a leaving hint where it came from.
</P>
<P>
Because of its scanty history, scientists have concluded that the
strain is somewhat containable because it kills its victims
faster that it can spread to new hosts.
