LOS ANGELES, Aug. 18 (Xinhua)
</P>
<P>
A video clip shot by sailors aboard U.S. nuclear-powered aircraft
carrier Ronald Reagan has been pulled off the YouTube video
sharing website after Navy officials complained it might
compromise security, a report said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The video, apparently shot by sailors based at a naval base in
California, has caused one sailor to be "counseled" and the
ship's captain to be called to the Pentagon to review security
procedures, according to the San Diego Union-Tribune newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the video was pulled even after a senior
Navy admiral had recommended that sailors watch the video, which
showed female sailors on board the Reagan merrily performing
their duties as set to country music.
</P>
<P>
Titled "Women of CVN 76: 'That Don't Impress Me Much'," the four-
minute clip had been viewed 31,000 times before it was pulled off
the popular website, apparently by the person who posted it.
</P>
<P>
CVN 76 is the Navy's call-sign for the aircraft carrier, which is
longer than the height of the Empire State Building and home to
5,500 sailors.
</P>
<P>
A Navy spokesman in San Diego told the paper that the video " was
a lighthearted and positive description of women officers and
sailors aboard aircraft carriers and in Navy squadrons."
</P>
<P>
U.S. Navy Lieutenant Commander Charlie Brown said the Navy was
concerned that the video producers exercised a "lack of
propriety" in a few scenes involving sailors dancing and lip-
synching with safety equipment.
</P>
<P>
One of the scenes showed a sailor dancing to the ditty dressed in
a full-body radiation suit, and also showed the doors to the
Reagan's nuclear power plant. The video also included a cameo
appearance by ship captain Terry Kraft.
</P>
<P>
Navy regulations strictly forbid the dissemination of photos of
anything related to the ship's nuclear propulsion gear.
</P>
<P>
Brown said the ship's captain was summoned to a Pentagon meeting
about the video, and the sailor who produced the video was
counseled.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the sailor who posted the video was not
identified, but his YouTube page also features videos of Naval
aviators based in California's Ventura County that frequently are
stationed on board the Reagan.
