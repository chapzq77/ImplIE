At least 10 people have been killed and more than 40 injured in
sectarian clashes started on Friday in a Pakistan tribal town, an
official said on Saturday.

Army was called out and curfew imposed in the city of Parachinar,
the capital of tribal Kurram Agency, some 290 km west of the
capital, Islamabad after the clashes took place on Friday.

"The army, back by the support of cobra helicopters, has now
taken full control of the city and the firing has also been
stopped," Local administrator Sahibzada Muhammad Anees told
private Geo Television from Parachinar on phone.

Clashes started when a group of Shia people took out a procession
in Parachinar and chanted slogans against the Sunnis days ago,
according to the News Network International (NNI) news agency.

Anees said that two helicopters hit positions of both sides from
where shots were being fired.

He said that the army and paramilitary militia have started joint
patrolling, adding that there would be no relaxation in curfew.

Geo reported that the authorities have issued shoot-at-sight
order if any one tried to violate curfew.

Fighting had also spread to adjoining areas of the city and both
sides were used heavy weapons, and a delegation of tribal elders
has been sent to the area to broker a ceasefire, according to
NNI.
