US pushes Pakistan over curtailed freedoms
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The United States on Friday demanded that Pakistan's Pervez
Musharraf grant freedom of movement to opposition leaders and end
former prime minister Benazir Bhutto's house arrest.
</P>
<P>
"Former Prime Minister Bhutto and other political party members
must be permitted freedom of movement and all protesters
released," said US National Security Council spokesman Gordon
Johndroe.
</P>
<P>
"We remain concerned about the continued state of emergency and
curtailment of basic freedoms, and urge Pakistan's authorities to
quickly return to constitutional order and democratic norms,"
said Johndroe.
</P>
<P>
In Pakistan, Deputy Information Minister Tariq Azeem told AFP
that Bhutto had been detained for her own safety and would be
free to go late Friday.
</P>
<P>
"It was a temporary detention order to keep her from getting
exposed to a very serious threat of suicide bombing. That order
will be withdrawn tonight in the next few hours," he said.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan police blocked Bhutto from leaving her home, as she
pleaded with them to free her to lead a rally against Musharraf's
national state of emergency, which has drawn international
condemnation.
</P>
<P>
"I am your sister fighting for democracy," she told them as
police blocked her route with armored personnel carriers.
</P>
<P>
Speaking with AFP by telephone from inside her bullet-proof car,
she said: "I am not afraid of these tactics. My struggle is for
the people of Pakistan, for their rights and for an end to
dictatorship."
</P>
<P>
"It is crucial for Pakistan's future that moderate political
forces work together to bring Pakistan back on the path to
democracy," Johndroe said as US President George W. Bush prepared
to meet with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on his Texas ranch.
</P>
<P>
At the US State Department, spokesman Sean McCormack echoed
Bush's demands, made in public and in a telephone call to
Musharraf on Wednesday, that the general quit as army chief and
hold scheduled elections as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
"It is important he (Musharraf) take off the uniform. It is
important he rescind the state of emergency and return back to
constitutional rule, it is important the government release those
individuals who are responsible peaceful forces within the
Pakistani political system from their detention," he said.
</P>
<P>
"It is important in our view that political party leaders and
responsible moderate forces in Pakistan, that those individuals
be able to have freedom of movement, freedom of expression, with
the thought in mind that it is important in the current
atmosphere to try to maintain an atmosphere of calm," he said.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether freeing Bhutto set low expectations for Pakistan,
McCormack said it was "critically important" to give moderate
political figures a role in Pakistan's return to the path to
democracy.
</P>
<P>
Heightening tensions further, a suicide bomber blew himself up at
the house of a minister in the northwestern city of Peshawar,
killing four people.
</P>
<P>
It was the first attack on a civilian target since military ruler
Musharraf declared the state of emergency Saturday citing growing
Islamic militancy and an unruly judiciary.
