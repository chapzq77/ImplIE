A massive crackdown on vote-buying will be launched prior to next
year's legislative election, which is expected to be hotly
contested due to the implementation of a new electoral system,
according to Minister of the Interior Lee Yi-yang.
</P>
<P>
Lee made the remarks Monday at a seminar on the prevention of
vote-buying, which was attended by senior prosecutors,
investigation officials, and police officials. Also present at
the seminar were Premier Chang Chun-hsiung and Minister of
Justice Shih Mao-lin.
</P>
<P>
Lee said that the National Police Agency under the Ministry of
Interior will hand out severe punishments to police who fail to
clamp down on vote-buying, while giving awards to those who make
effective efforts.
</P>
<P>
The total number of legislative seats will be halved from 225 to
113 next year, which is likely to result in a highly competitive
election Jan. 12, Lee said, while expressing concerns over the
possibility of worsened vote-buying practices.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Lee called on law enforcement officials to take a
neutral stand with regard to the political affiliation of
candidates, saying that the investigations should not target at
any party.
