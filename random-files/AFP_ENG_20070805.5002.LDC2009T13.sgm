RugbyU: Ashton seeks greater harmony after Wales rout
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
England coach Brian Ashton was far from satisfied despite seeing
his side begin the warm-up for the defence of their World Cup
title with a record 62-5 rout of Wales at Twickenham.
</P>
<P>
Against a Welsh team fielding just a handful of first-choice
players, England ran in nine tries with No 8 Nick Easter scoring
four of them.
</P>
<P>
England outmuscled Wales up front, their pack utterly dominant
and the 57-point margin of victory was the best in Anglo-Welsh
Test history surpassing England's 50-10 win at Twickenham in
2002.
</P>
<P>
But despite their try count concerns remained about England's
attacking threat beyond the close-quarter exchanges with a couple
of scores botched by poor handling and a failure to utilise
overlaps.
</P>
<P>
England, who could meet Wales in the quarter-finals of the World
Cup, which starts next month, are sure to face a sterner test
when tournament hosts France visit Twickenham on August 11 and
Ashton said there was still room for England, who've won just
five of their last 17 Tests, to improve.
</P>
<P>
"What really annoyed me was that there was one phase in the the
second half where we were in the Welsh 22 for five minutes where
Jason Robinson was stood totally unmarked on the wing, 15 metres
out, with the play going around him and was completely ignored,"
Ashton said.
</P>
<P>
"Jason on his own against three defenders, you give him the ball
in that situation and I think there were two or three occasions
where we did create opportunities and the communication system
broke down for some reason. That's what I'll be looking to
improve."
</P>
<P>
One longstanding criticism of England is that they place too much
reliance on their pack and, as a consequence, can come unstuck
when they face top-class sides such as New Zealand, the World Cup
favourites, and South Africa who can match them physically.
</P>
<P>
However, Ashton was adamant England hadn't simply played a 'nine-
man' game against Wales.
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't all that tight a game at all. There was a real
mixture," he said.
</P>
<P>
"In the first half I remember our backs taking their guys on in
the middle of the field one-on-one and making clean line breaks
which we should have finished off.
</P>
<P>
"There's not much point whizzing the ball all over the park when
you are five metres out and you've got a pack that can score
without passing it.
</P>
<P>
"The good news was we showed quite a bit of balance to our game.
We drove the ball well, we ran the ball well in the first half
and our kicking game came into play with our last two tries."
</P>
<P>
England scrum-half Shaun Perry, a constant threat to Wales from
around the fringes was one of the home side's try scorers along
with Steve Borthwick, Lawrence Dallaglio, Robinson and Mathew
Tait.
</P>
<P>
Perry, told to lose weight by Ashton during England's 2-0 series
defeat against South Africa in June, was named man-of-the-match
and the England coach also praised the midfield duo of debutant
Dan Hipkiss and former Great Britain rugby league captain Andy
Farrell
</P>
<P>
"He has worked incredibly hard after a pretty informal chat in
South Africa about his body shape," said Ashton of Perry. "He
looks a better player for it.
</P>
<P>
"That was the best game Andy Farrell has played in an England
shirt without a shadow of a doubt. He very rarely makes mistakes,
his distribution is good and he puts players through holes. He
played like Andy Farrell can play.
</P>
<P>
"And I thought Danny did some good stuff. He didn't look out of
place, he didn't look fazed at all. That is pressure at the
highest level, coming in for his first cap, knowing you have to
make a statement otherwise you might not get selected for the
World Cup.
</P>
<P>
"I was pretty pleased with the performance. If someone said we
would win 62-5 I would have found it hard to believe."
</P>
<P>
The World Cup squad deadline day of August 14, when coaches of
all sides must name their final 30-man parties, comes before
England's final warm-up match against France in Marseille on
August 18.
