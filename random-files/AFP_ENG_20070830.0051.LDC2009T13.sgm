Diana fans gather at Paris crash site
</HEADLINE>

<P>
A handful of Diana fans gathered late Thursday at the Paris site
where the princess's car crashed 10 years ago, almost hour for
hour.
</P>
<P>
The Alma tunnel, on the north bank of the River Seine, is a must-
see spot for tourists who are drawn to the site where the 36
-year-old Diana crashed shortly after midnight on August 31,
1997.
</P>
<P>
Britain is marking the 10th anniversary of Princess Diana's death
Friday with a royal memorial service to the "people's princess."
</P>
<P>
No official events are planned in Paris, but well-wishers have
left dozens of bouquets and photo tributes at the foot of a
sculpture of a giant golden flame above the tunnel, which has
become an ad-hoc shrine since her death.
</P>
<P>
And some wanted to be here near the very hour of the tragedy,
which happened at 26 minutes past midnight (2226 GMT) -- to see
the spot in the middle of the night, and to take photographs.
</P>
<P>
"It's a coincidence we are here in Paris on the anniversary of
her death," said Anna Gould, 34, who came here from Devon with
her husband Ken, 42, and their three daughters aged 13, nine and
four.
</P>
<P>
"But I was eager to see the place and to show it to the girls.
Diana was really the people's princess, she did a lot of good,
the old bunch at the palace just couldn't take it."
</P>
<P>
"Diana was a lovely and generous princess, but Prince Charles and
his mother the Queen were so nasty to her that she died heart-
broken," she said.
</P>
<P>
On the afternoon of August 30, 1997, Diana -- who was then
divorced from Prince Charles, father of her sons -- flew into the
French capital from Sardinia with her boyfriend Dodi Fayed, 42.
</P>
<P>
After several hours shopping, the couple dined at the exclusive
Ritz hotel owned by Fayed's father, the Egyptian millionaire and
Harrods magnate Mohamed Al Fayed.
</P>
<P>
They left at around midnight in a car driven by the deputy head
of security at the Ritz, Henri Paul, who was called back after an
evening off duty to help smuggle the couple from the hotel unseen
by the paparazzi posted outside.
</P>
<P>
Some paparazzi were taken in by the ploy, but others set out in
pursuit of Paul's Mercedes, headed at high speed towards the
Champs-Elysees avenue.
</P>
<P>
At 26 minutes past midnight, after running a red light on the
Place de la Concorde, the Mercedes went out of control at high
speed and crashed into a support pillar in the Alma underpass.
</P>
<P>
The driver was killed instantly, Dodi died as emergency services
arrived and the princess was declared dead in a Paris hospital at
4:00 am.
</P>
<P>
Despite many conspiracy theories, propagated by the likes of Al
Fayed, French police insist Diana's death was a tragic accident.
</P>
<P>
But at the site, a strange inscription looms, referring to
Diana's sons William and Harry, and sending a chill down the
spines of visitors: "Your sons will want to know, if they let
them live..."
