St. Patrick's Day symbolizes to many of us the imminent approach
of spring while stirring thoughts of a lovely land of
friendliness. Whether you are pondering your first trip or a
return visit, here are some offers to get you thinking green.

In these more peaceful times, Northern Ireland is beginning to
attract more visitors with its beauty and history. Inroads
Ireland is offering weeklong Go North tours on dates in June,
July, September, and October for $1,700 a person, excluding
airfare but including stays in bed-and-breakfast inns, breakfast,
and sightseeing that includes Belfast, Derry, the Antrim
coastline, and the Giants Causeway. The trip begins and ends in
Dublin so you will see a wee bit of the Republic of Ireland as
well.

If Robbie O'Connell hosts a tour as well as he sings, then
participants in the Best of the West tour are in for a treat. The
trip, May 19-28, visits Sligo, Leenane, Galway, Ennistymon,
Tralee, and Dingle, among other places, taking in castles, scenic
and historical sites, the theater, and pubs where the music flows
freely. The price of $2,999 a person includes Boston-Shannon
airfare ($2,499 land only), eight dinners, nine breakfasts,
admissions, and gratuities for hotels, and included meals. At
last word, just a few openings were left, but there is always
next year.

I have been getting excellent feedback about trips conducted by
Patricia Tunison Preston in association with CIE Tours. Preston,
the author of several books on Ireland, and her husband, John,
have these trips for 2008: Springtime in Ireland, April 19-26,
for $1,269, land only; the Monsignor Charlie Coen Ireland Tour,
July 20-29, $2,599 with airfare from New York or $1,850, land
only; and the 7th Annual West of Ireland Coastal Tour, Oct.
19-25, from $1,649 including airfare from Boston, or $1,159 land
only. Tunison's website contains a lot of information about
Ireland and the Irish, and a link for 5 percent off a regularly
scheduled CIE tour.

Maybe you don't want to travel with a group? No problem: Trips
for independent travelers, featuring bed-and-breakfast stays and
rental cars, are both available and economical. Boston-based
Brian Moore International Tours, for instance, has an Amazing
Ireland trip beginning at $329 with vouchers for five nights in
B&amp;amp;Bs and a six-day economy car rental. A Friendly Ireland
B&amp;amp;B Package with London includes six nights in Ireland
and two nights in London.

Many consider Boston the unofficial Irish capital of America. A
good place to learn about all things Irish - travel, shopping,
cultural groups and venues, pubs and restaurants - is the website
of the Boston Irish Tourism Association.
