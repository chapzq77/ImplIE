IN WHITE HOUSE DECOR, WHAT WILL CHANGE LOOK LIKE?
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ever since Mary Todd Lincoln overshot the White House decorating
budget by $6,700 (a third of her $20,000 appropriation),
infuriating her husband and delighting a press corps that had
already turned against her, the redecoration of the president's
house has been a public relations minefield. Some new
administrations tiptoe through it unscathed; others are less
nimble, and bombs explode.
</P>

"It's an old maxim that you can build a billion-dollar highway
that's the biggest pork barrel in the world and no one will say
anything," said William Seale, a White House historian, "but if
you're in public office and you try and change your desk, you're
going to end up on the front page. In presidential decor, one
must remember the public eye is fixed on everything you do."

Barack Obama's transition team has not responded to inquiries
about his interior design plans. However the Obamas decide to
proceed, they'll have to follow a few basic rules.
</P>
<P>
For starters, they will have to pay for their own movers. And
while Congress budgets $100,000 in household transition costs for
every new administration, if the Obamas spend more than that --
and most first families do -- they will have to cover the expense
of decorating their private quarters with private donations.

Decorating the White House is the first lady's job; she presides
over the Committee for the Preservation of the White House, a
board of appointees that includes her decorator and the White
House curator, as well as art historians, furniture and
decorative art experts and other advisers on historic
preservation.
</P>
<P>
Renovations of the public rooms, additions to the formidable
collections of art and furniture, and any restoration work is
overseen by the committee and financed by the White House
Endowment Fund, which now has assets of about $27 million.

When it comes to the private quarters, on the second and third
floors, and the Oval Office, though, the decor is the "personal
decision of the first family," said Tom Savage, director of
museum affairs at Winterthur in Delaware and a member of the
Committee for the Preservation of the White House during the
Clinton administration. "But there are so many safeguards. The
misconception of the public is that a first family can make very
dramatic changes, and that's just not so."
