STARBUCKS REPORTS 28 PERCENT DROP IN PROFIT AND TRIMS STORE
OPENINGS

SAN FRANCISCO
</P>
<P>
Facing an increasingly stingy consumer, Starbucks is tightening
its belt.
</P>
<P>
With profit down 28 percent, Starbucks said it would open fewer
new stores in the United States, slash expenses and sell better-
tasting coffee in the face of a troubled economy that is leaving
some consumers with less discretionary income.
</P>
<P>
"This is a very tough operating environment for us, and we're not
alone," Howard Schultz, the company's chief executive, said in an
interview. "We're redirecting the growth of our U.S. stores to
reflect the tough economy."
</P>
<P>
Starbucks said second quarter profit fell 28 percent, to $108.7
million, from $150.8 million a year earlier, while per-share
earnings declined 21 percent, to 15 cents, from 19 cents. The
results included reorganization costs of about 3 cents a share.
The company said revenue rose 12 percent, to $2.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
The report came just a week after Starbucks warned of lower-than-
expected earnings and cut its full-year forecast, citing a
decline in quarterly sales and describing the economic
environment as the weakest in the company's history. Wall Street
analysts had forecast 19 cents a share for the quarter.
</P>
<P>
Most recently, Starbucks has suffered the effects of the crisis
in the housing market, particularly in southern California and
south Florida.
</P>
<P>
What used to be an "affordable luxury," is no longer that for
some customers, Schultz said, referring to Starbuck's signature
espresso drinks.
</P>
<P>
"Like most other retailers and restaurants, we are experiencing a
downturn in customer traffic, demonstrated in reduced frequency
of customer visits, that we believe ties to a real reduction in
consumers' discretionary spending habits," Schultz said.
</P>
<P>
The report, released after the close of regular trading, had
little impact on Starbuck's shares. The stock, which fell 11
percent after the company's warning last week, rose 3 cents, to
$16.23 a share, in regular trading.
</P>
<P>
"This is certainly a positive step," said Larry Miller, an
analyst with RBC Capital Markets. "At least they're on the road
to recovery, but I think it's going to be a long road."
</P>
<P>
Schultz, who returned as chief executive in January in hopes of
turning the company around, said the results were heavily
influenced by operations in the United States, which accounted
for 77 percent of revenue. Same store sales in the United States
fell by about 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
"We are not satisfied with the downturn of traffic in our stores,
and we are working diligently to reverse that," Schultz said.
"There are no sacred cows."
</P>
<P>
Starbucks said that in the United States it planned to open 1,020
stores this year, down from its previous target of 1,175, and to
open fewer than 400 stores a year between 2009 and 2011. But
internationally, the company plans to continue its expansion,
with more than 1,000 new stores a year between 2009 and 2011.
Starbucks' store count will be about 21,500 stores by the end of
2011.
</P>
<P>
The company, based in Seattle, plans to cut capital expenses to
$800 million, from about $1.1 billion, from 2009 to 2011. About
70 percent of that will be for stores.
</P>
<P>
Schultz said that while customers were not visiting Starbucks
stores as often as they once did, he did not believe that meant
they were abandoning Starbucks for its competitors.
</P>
<P>
Schultz said the company had begun to lure customers back with a
new coffee called Pike Place Roast, a better brewing system and
improved service. The company also announced three new cold
beverages.
</P>
<P>
Starbucks expects profit this fiscal year to be lower than the 87
cents a share reported last year, but company officials declined
to provide precise figures. The company expects revenue growth of
13 percent to 14 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
Looking ahead over the next three years, the company expects
profit per share of 90 cents to $1 in 2009, $1.10 to $1.20 in
2010 and $1.35 to $1.50 in 2011.
