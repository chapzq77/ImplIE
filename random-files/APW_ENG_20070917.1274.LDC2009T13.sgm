New York city, state sue Merck for benefit fraud over its since-
withdrawn painkiller Vioxx

NEW YORK 2007-09-17 20:05:46 UTC

<P>
The state and city of New York sued Merck &amp; Co. Inc. on
Monday, accusing the drugmaker of defrauding the main health
benefit program for the poor and other government insurance
programs by hiding the risks of heart problems associated with
its pain medication Vioxx.
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit, filed in Manhattan's state Supreme Court, said the
state's Medicaid and Elderly Pharmaceutical Insurance Coverage
programs have paid more than $100 million (euro72 million) for
Vioxx prescriptions since the drug went on sale in 1999.
</P>
<P>
For its residents receiving Medicaid assistance, New York City
paid a substantial share of those costs.
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit says tens of millions of dollars (euros) were paid
for prescriptions for patients with preexisting heart conditions.
Those funds would not have been spent had the risks associated
with Vioxx been known, court papers say.
</P>
<P>
The filing was announced by New York state Attorney General
Andrew M. Cuomo and New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg.
</P>
<P>
Merck, based in Whitehouse Station, New Jersey, removed Vioxx
from the market in Sept. 30, 2004 because it doubled risk of
heart attack and stroke.
</P>
<P>
Before stopping Vioxx sales, court papers say, Merck "undertook a
concerted and tenacious campaign of false and fraudulent
statements to minimize the import and seriousness" of the
possible association between Vioxx and heart problems.
</P>
<P>
This "disinformation campaign" continued until a month before
Merck ceased sales of the drug, causing New York doctors to
continue writing prescriptions for Vioxx that they otherwise
would not have written, according to the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
Merck spokesman Kent Jarrell said the company researched and
monitored the drug while it was on the market and voluntarily
withdrew it when problems were suspected.
</P>
<P>
"We are confident that our behavior has been responsible,"
Jarrell said, adding that similar lawsuits seeking reimbursement
for insurance costs have been filed in "a handful" of other
states.
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit asks that Merck be ordered to pay New York City and
the state three times their damages, to be determined at trial.
It also asks that Merck be required to pay the state a civil
penalty of $12,000 (euro8,647) for each false claim, and $15,000
(euro10,809) to the city for each such violation. The number of
false claims would be determined at trial.
</P>
<P>
Merck faces almost 27,000 lawsuits from people claiming Vioxx
caused heart attacks and strokes, but more than 1,170 cases have
been dismissed. Of cases that have reached verdicts, Merck has
won nine and lost five; a new trial was ordered in another case.
