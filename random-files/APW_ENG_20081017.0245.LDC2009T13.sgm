China Investment Corp. may up stake in Blackstone

<P>
China Investment Corp., the government's sovereign wealth fund,
may raise its stake in U.S. investment group Blackstone LP after
the two agreed to boost the Chinese company's ownership limit.
</P>
<P>
CIC had paid US$3 billion for a stake in Blackstone's June 2007
initial public offering, but has seen the value of that
investment sink in the bear market, to the consternation of many
in China.
</P>
<P>
According to a regulatory filing, a revised agreement reached
Thursday between Blackstone and CIC unit Beijing Wonderful
Investments Ltd. has raised the limit on the Chinese company's
stake to 12.5 percent from 9.99 percent.
</P>
<P>
The filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission,
posted on Blackstone's Web site, did not require regulatory
approval.
</P>
<P>
There was no official comment from CIC on its plans for
additional share purchases. At the time of Blackstone's IPO, its
shares were valued at US$31 apiece. On Thursday, they rose 1.7
percent to US$9.36.
</P>
<P>
The US$200 billion investment arm of the Chinese government was
set up to make profitable use of Beijing's foreign reserves,
which totaled US$1.9 trillion by the end of September.
</P>
<P>
Most of those funds are kept in U.S. Treasuries and other safe
but low-yielding securities. But there has been grumbling about
the performance of some of the fund's higher profile investments
amid the recent market turmoil.
</P>
<P>
CIC's biggest investment to date was a US$5 billion investment in
Morgan Stanley, one of nine major banks now seeking relief from
the deepening credit crisis through the U.S. government's US$700
billion banking bailout. That purchase will give it a 9.9 percent
stake in the investment bank.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese sovereign wealth fund also invested more than US$100
million in Visa Inc.'s US$19.1 billion IPO and has invested in a
fund managed by J.C. Flowers, a U.S. private equity firm.
