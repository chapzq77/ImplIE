KATHMANDU, July 7 (Xinhua)
</P>
<P>
An official at the Nepali Home Ministry on Saturday said it would
be difficult for the Nepali government to hold the elections to
constituent assembly (CA) at the same time across the country,
the local media house's website ekantipur.com reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Secretary of the Home Ministry Umesh Mainali said the task of
holding CA polls across the country at the same time would be
difficult because of  the insufficient number of police
personnel, including Armed Police Force (APF) at the government's
disposal.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a program held in Dolakha, some 50 km east of
Kathmandu, Mainali said, "With the Election Commission's (EC)
repeated refusal to hold the elections, it will be very difficult
for some 55,000 police and 23,000 APF to provide security at all
polling booths."
</P>
<P>
Stating that it was impossible to assign three-four police
personnel per polling station, Home Secretary Mainali said that
it was necessary to set up temporary security outfits for the
election.
</P>
<P>
Claiming that the Home Ministry was committed to holding timely
election come what may, Mainali informed that 455 vehicles --
enough for each police post -- had already arrived and that the
government will make arrangements for 10,000 communication sets.
