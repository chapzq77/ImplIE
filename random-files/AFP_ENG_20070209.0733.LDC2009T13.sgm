Cycling: Landis blasts USADA over sample re-test bid
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Embattled 2006 Tour de France champion Floyd Landis blasted the
US Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) on Friday regarding attempts to re-
test cleared doping samples from last year's race.
</P>
<P>
Landis tested positive for testosterone after winning stage 17 of
the cycling classic last July but has challenged the handling of
the sample and testing conditions at the French laboatory which
processed the dope test.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, Landis said he was responding to a report in the
French sports newspaper l'Equipe regarding attempts by USADA to
re-test samples from the race plus two subsequent out-of-
competition samples given last August.
</P>
<P>
Landis was upset at a request last December from USADA attorney
Travis Tygart for more tests on "B" portions of cleared "A"
samples from Labaratoire National Depistage de Dopage's (LNDD)
laboratory at Chatenay-Malabry.
</P>
<P>
Landis was upset at the notion of retesting samples he considers
tainted at the very center whose procedures he is challenging in
an appeal of his doping positive to USADA. That hearing is set
for May 14.
</P>
<P>
"They got it wrong the first time and they're trying to get it
wrong again," Landis said in the statement.
</P>
<P>
"I am very concerned regarding the LNDD's handling of my samples
over the last six months as well as the Anti-Doping Agencies'
complete and consistent disregard of their own rules and
procedures.
</P>
<P>
"With the steady stream of news flow regarding serious problems
at the LNDD, it's impossible to understand USADA's motivation for
this move unless it's simply another way to drain my resources in
this fight to clear my name.
</P>
<P>
"My message to USADA and the LNDD is this testing should have
been done right the first time."
</P>
<P>
Landis argues his stage 17 positive came from a contaminated
sample that LNDD continued to process in violation of World Anti-
Doping Agency protocols.
</P>
<P>
"I have not taken testosterone or any other performance enhancing
substance," Landis said.
</P>
<P>
Landis has agreed not to race in France this season, giving him
no chance to defend the crown that could be stripped from him if
the positive dope test stands.
</P>
<P>
"I'm 100 percent confident that if best practice in process and
technology were applied to testing my sample back in July, I
would be racing my bike this season," Landis said.
</P>
<P>
While critics could argue that if Landis had nothing to hide, he
has no reason to object to more testing of samples that were
clear, Landis argues the re-test move would violate WADA and
International Cycling Union rules.
</P>
<P>
"USADA's request for further analysis of "B" samples is in clear
violation the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) Code and Union
Cyclist International (UCI) rules and is unprecedented in athlete
anti-doping cases," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"USADA's illegal initiative would also cause the Landis team to
expend unnecessary resources to halt a clearly prohibited
activity - resources that have already been unduly and unfairly
stretched by the ADA's unethical approach to their pursuit of
unsubstantiated allegations against Landis."
</P>
<P>
Landis' legal team claims to have been denied full access to
details of his results "and has no reason to believe that it
would be provided with the results of any further tests", the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
Landis attorney Maurice Suh expects it would not receive
documentation from any proposed re-testing.
</P>
<P>
"Illegal re-testing of these cleared samples is designed to
further injure Floyd by costing him and his team substantial time
and money, more deeply invading his privacy and destroying
evidence that may later on be valuable in his defense," Suh said.
</P>
<P>
"USADA continues to dramatically demonstrate that they have no
interest in providing Floyd with a fair and just outcome to this
process."
