<P>
North Korea should be given whatever it wants in international
talks to convince the communist regime to dismantle its nuclear
program, South Korea's president was quoted as saying Friday.
</P>
<P>
"We should resolve the problem by giving North Korea whatever it
wants," President Roh Moo-hyun told a meeting of South Korean
expatriates in Rome, Italy, reported the Yonhap news agency.
</P>
<P>
Roh was praising the recent six-nation agreement in which North
Korea committed itself to shuttering its main nuclear complex and
disabling all its nuclear facilities in exchange for political
and economic incentives.
</P>
<P>
The landmark accord reached Tuesday will provide North Korea with
the equivalent of up to 1 million tons of heavy fuel oil and
improved relations with the U.S.
</P>
<P>
In return, North Korea promised to verifiably shut down its main
nuclear complex in Yongbyon, north of Pyongyang, within 60 days.
</P>
<P>
Roh said he was "optimistic" about the accord's implementation,
but voiced concern about the North's unpredictability.
</P>
<P>
"What I'm most concerned about is North Korea. Even if an
agreement is reached, it is difficult to predict" whether the
North will honor it, he said.
</P>
<P>
Roh's office in Seoul could not immediately confirm his comments
Thursday in Italy, the final leg of his weeklong European trip
that also included stops in Spain and the Vatican.
