Episcopal Leader Seeks Patience on Issues of Sexuality
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The presiding bishop of the Episcopal Church said Wednesday that
it is being pushed toward painful decisions on questions of
sexuality and scriptural interpretation by ``impatient forces''
eager for clarity, but urged members to wait and be without fear
as the church struggles through a difficult time.
</P>
<P>
Appearing in a live webcast, the Most Rev. Katharine Jefferts
Schori acknowledged that the church, the American wing of the
global Anglican Communion, risks losing its place and voice in
that fellowship if it does not comply with demands from Anglican
leaders that it bar official blessings for same-sex couples and
take other actions.
</P>
<P>
Jefferts Schori said, however, that she believed the church was
being asked to pause, not retreat from its positions on the
divisive issues. ``If we can lower the emotional reactivity in
the midst of this current controversy, we just might be able to
find a way to live together,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting that ended last week in Tanzania, the leaders, or
primates, of Anglican provinces around the world issued an
ultimatum to the U.S church. By Sept. 30, they said, the
Episcopal Church must state explicitly that it will not authorize
blessings for same-sex couples and will bar gay men and lesbians
from becoming bishops.
</P>
<P>
In 2003, a long-simmering conflict between liberal and
conservative church members in the United States and abroad
reached crisis when the Episcopal Church consecrated its first
gay bishop, V. Gene Robinson of New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Robinson made his first public comments on the
Tanzania meeting, saying the Episcopal Church should not yield to
demands that it roll back its acceptance of gays. Instead, he
said, it should ``get on with the work of the Gospel.''
</P>
<P>
In response, Jefferts Schori said Wednesday that such a decision
was not hers to make, and that she did not know exactly where the
Episcopal Church's leadership and membership stood. She said a
clearer understanding might emerge after two upcoming meetings: a
gathering this weekend of its executive council, which includes
bishops, clergy and laity, and of its House of Bishops in mid-
March.

At several points during her hour-long webcast from New York, in
which she answered questions submitted by phone, e-mail and from
a studio audience, she acknowledged the anguish and anxiety the
conflict was causing those on all sides.
</P>
<P>
That pain was evident in several of the questions. One caller
said her daughter, a lesbian seeking to become an Episcopal
priest, was broken-hearted by the primates' demands.
</P>
<P>
Another woman, who said she was listening to the webcast with her
partner, said she could not view the proposed restrictions for
gays with the understanding and patience that Jefferts Schori
advised. ``It seems very harsh,'' the caller said.
</P>
<P>
Jefferts Schori, who has expressed support for gay clergy and
blessing same-sex unions, told the woman she shared some of her
concerns. But she repeated her call for forbearance.
</P>
<P>
``We are being pushed toward a decision by impatient forces
within and outside this church who hunger for clarity,'' she
said. ``That hunger for clarity at all costs is an anxious
response to discomfort in the face of change.''
