Slovenian EU presidency to focus on EU enlargement, Kosovo,
minister says

Slovenia was once part of Yugoslavia, a country whose breakup in
the 1990s triggered wars, genocide, hatred and suffering. Now
that Slovenia will assume the presidency of the European Union,
it wants to make sure those days are gone forever.
</P>
<P>
"We believe it is high time for the Yugoslav crisis to be over,"
Dimitrij Rupel told journalists in Brussels Thursday.
</P>
<P>
His country, the only former Yugoslav nation to join the European
Union so far, will assume the revolving 6-month EU presidency on
Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
During its presidency, Slovenia wants to resolve the Kosovo
crisis and speed up the accession of other former Yugoslav
nations into the 27-nation union, Rupel said.
</P>
<P>
Slovenia joined the European Union in 2004. All other ex-Yugoslav
nations, as well as their Balkan neighbor Albania, have concluded
pre-membership agreements with the EU. Croatia is expected to
become a member by 2010; the others are likely to follow within
four or five years.
</P>
<P>
"Slovenia would like to see an intensification of this accession
process," Rupel said. "If there is a momentum, things can advance
very quickly, especially if Serbia and Croatia advance faster."
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav federation started falling apart in 1991, with wars
in Slovenia, Croatia and Bosnia. All three of the former Yugoslav
states, along with Macedonia, declared independence in 1991 or
1992.
</P>
<P>
Fragmentation continued with NATO's 1999 air war against Serb
forces who were fighting ethnic Albanian rebels in Kosovo. At the
end of the war, the province was taken over by an interim U.N.
administration. And in 2006, Montenegro and Serbia separated to
form two independent countries.
</P>
<P>
What was once one country is now five. If Kosovo becomes
independent, that would make it six.
</P>
<P>
For the past two years, efforts have been under way to resolve
the impasse over Kosovo's future. The ethnic Albanian government
of the province insists on becoming an independent country.
Serbia wants to retain the province as an autonomous, self-
governing region.
</P>
<P>
A series of internationally mediated talks between the Serbs and
Albanians ended without agreement. On Wednesday, the U.N.
Security Council failed to agree on how to proceed. Russia, which
holds a veto in the Security Council, and some other council
members have blocked a push by the United States and the European
Union to implement a U.N. plan that would grant Kosovo limited
independence closely supervised by the international community.
</P>
<P>
The EU has resisted endorsing quick independence for Kosovo, but
it has agreed in principle to send a 1,800-member police and
security mission to Kosovo next year to help build up its police,
legal system and other state institutions.
</P>
<P>
But countries such as Cyprus, Spain, Slovakia, Romania and Greece
have expressed fears that Kosovo's independence would encourage
separatist movements elsewhere. There are concerns the issue
could cause a rift that would jeopardize the EU's common foreign
policy.
</P>
<P>
"I am worried that somebody might succeed in dividing the EU,"
Rupel said. "Slovenia will work hard to maintain EU unity."
</P>
<P>
The nation of two million people is the first of the 12 members
that have joined since 2004 to preside over the European Union.
It has a tiny diplomatic network and its successor in the
presidency, France, has agreed to represent Slovenia in 110
nations around the world during its six-month presidency.
