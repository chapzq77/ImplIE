BOTTLING PLAN PUSHES GROUNDWATER TO CENTER STAGE IN VERMONT
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
EAST MONTPELIER, Vt.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of gallons of groundwater flow to the surface in
rivulets here each hour, helping to create this town's signature
spring, a lush current typical of northern New England. Just
uphill, a meadow stretches to the doorstep of Daniel Antonovich,
a businessman with plans to bottle and sell about 250,000 gallons
a day from the spring.
</P>
<P>
The idea makes his neighbors nervous. Like two-thirds of
Vermonters and 40 percent of New Englanders, most residents of
East Montpelier depend on wells. Some worry that a water-bottling
operation will compromise their ability to shower and flush;
others just do not want their local water sold elsewhere. In
corners of the state, once-reliable well-water supplies have
become intermittent in recent years, with homeowners blaming
local developers or mining operations or a bottling operation. In
March, the town of East Montpelier postponed any bottling for
three years. Three months later, in a move that put Vermont in
the company of a growing number of states, the legislature
adopted a law making its groundwater a public trust. Beginning in
2010, anyone seeking to pump more than 57,600 gallons a day will
need a permit, with exceptions for farming operations, water
utilities, fire districts and some geothermal systems.
</P>
<P>
Groundwater worries, long commonplace in the arid West, have
spread to the country's wettest areas (and few could be wetter
than Vermont this summer). In recent years, eastern aquifers have
been drawn down in areas around Chicago and Milwaukee, as well as
Atlanta. Water had to be trucked into Montgomery, a town in
northern Vermont, last summer during a drought. "Water is the
resource of the 21st century," said Laurence R. Becker, Vermont's
state geologist. "The amount of water that we use will increase
and we will be looking for fresh water in many places."
</P>
<P>
With the growing recognition that groundwater is not limitless,
more states and localities are looking for ways to protect it.
Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan and New Hampshire are at the
forefront of this trend, and Vermont is now making its move.
</P>
<P>
The concerns of East Montpelier residents are reflected in the
Great Lakes Resources compact, a broad water-management agreement
already approved by the U.S. Senate and by eight Midwestern
states and two Canadian provinces.
</P>
<P>
"Public policy makers are wrestling with legal systems designed
in an era of abundance," said Andy Buchsbaum,director of the
Great Lakes office of the National Wildlife Federation. "They
were not designed to address shortages."
</P>
<P>
Ginny Lyons, a Democratic state senator in Vermont, believes
that, given the possibility of a future in which water supplies
may be constrained, "We've been doing things in an irrational
way. We make the assumption that just because you get so many
gallons out of a well now, you will forever."
</P>
<P>
She and state Sen. Diane Snelling, a Republican, responding to
groundwater debates from Williston, a suburb of Burlington,
(where neighbors fought over well water) to the town of Danby
(where local residents opposed a mining operation), this year
succeeded, by a large margin, in winning adoption of the law
declaring groundwater a commonly owned resource -- in legal
parlance, a public trust.
</P>
<P>
Under the new Vermont law, there are still few restrictions on
using ground water, but the new system is designed to help map
it, measure it and apportion it. It puts home and farm uses of
water in front of the line in case of shortage, and making large-
scale withdrawals, like those contemplated by Antonovich, subject
to new permitting and monitoring.
</P>
<P>
Though Vermont is a relative latecomer in adopting the public
trust status for groundwater, Maude Barlow, a Canadian crusader
against bottled water and the author of "Blue Covenant: The
Global Water Crisis and the Coming Battle for the Right to
Water," argues that its new law, more than most, anticipates the
day when people's thirst for ground water outstrips supplies.
"It's no longer an under-the-radar issue," said Jon Groveman, the
general counsel of the Vermont Natural Resources Council. "There
is now a sense that groundwater is finite and needs to be
protected."
</P>
<P>
In the past decade, commercial and industrial users, including
golf courses, mining operations and, most notably, water
bottlers, have faced increasing local opposition in damp regions
from Maine to Wisconsin. Andrew W. MacLean, a lobbyist in
Montpelier who represents industries affected by the legislation,
said he believed the law duplicated existing requirements, but
did not want to oppose it. "There was a recognition by people
that something was going to pass," he said. "The desire by the
business community was to play an active role and shape it as we
were able." Early opponents, like farmers, mostly stayed on the
sidelines when their water uses were grandfathered under the law.
</P>
<P>
Surface water in streams, lakes and rivers, has been legally
managed for hundreds of years. But groundwater, until recent
years, was often treated as something separate, hydrologically
and legally. Both distinctions are now breaking down.
</P>
<P>
A 2007 report by the Ground Water Protection Council, a nonprofit
group, pointed out that, although much is not known about exactly
how ground water moves through geological formations, it
"typically moves very slowly." Replenishment from rain or surface
water, or "recharge" as the experts term it, tends to be gradual.
Extraction of ground water tends to alter natural flow patterns
and speeds, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Becker, Vermont's state geologist, said that the state's
groundwater travels along fractures in the rock, moving, in
effect, down a twisting series of underground tubes. Mapping a
Vermont aquifer and measuring its contents is thus akin to
tracing a Jackson Pollock painting -- there are numerous units,
of irregular dimensions, to delineate.
</P>
<P>
While some residents of East Montpelier worry that their wells
may suffer if Antonovich's firm, Montpelier Springs Water Co.,
opens for business, Antonovich said that he has had the aquifer
mapped and that there is more than enough water for all.
Nonetheless, he keeps cordial relations with those who oppose
him, said Carolyn Shapiro, one of a group of Antonovich's
neighbors who pushed for the moratorium.
</P>
<P>
Antonovich, a New York-area furrier who has been vacationing in
Vermont for half a century, said he did not plan to contest the
moratorium.
</P>
<P>
The relative cordiality between Antonovich and his neighbors also
typified the debate over the public-trust law. Jon Groveman of
the Vermont Natural Resources Council, one of the bill's
architects, drew praise not only from its legislative sponsors
but also from MacLean, who represented the golf course and
bottled-water industries.
</P>
<P>
The law, Lyons said, commanded such broad support in part because
it calls for mapping and monitoring, not increased regulation.
"It is a beginning," she said. Buchsbaum said he believes that
the Vermont law, like the Great Lakes compact, can produce fairer
and more comprehensive results when done in advance of a crisis,
or "we'll be trying to change our water laws in the context that
the West is now," he said. "There is no water and they're trying
to apportion droplets. They're in the terrible position of trying
to judge between needs that are all critical with not enough
resources."
</P>
<P>
Buchsbaum added, "We have the chance to get ahead of it."
