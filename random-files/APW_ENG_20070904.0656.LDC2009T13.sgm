Hurricane Felix slammed into Nicaragua's Miskito Coast as a
record-breaking Category 5 monster storm Tuesday in an area home
to thousands of stranded Miskito Indians.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, off Mexico's Pacific coast, Tropical Storm Henriette
strengthened into a hurricane with 120 kph (75 mph) winds and the
U.S. National Hurricane Center said it was plowing toward the
upscale resort of Cabo San Lucas, popular with Hollywood stars
and sea fishing enthusiasts.
</P>
<P>
Felix landed around dawn at Punta Gorda with winds of about 260
kph (160 mph), only two weeks after Hurricane Dean struck Mexico,
further up the Caribbean coast. It was first time that two
Category 5 hurricanes have hit land in a season since 1886,
according to the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration. Only 31 such storms have been recorded in the
Atlantic, including eight in the last five seasons.
</P>
<P>
Nicaragua's Civil Defense chief, Rogelio Flores, said 2,000
people were evacuated before the hurricane blew roofs off homes,
blocked roads and knocked out telephone service. But many other
Miskito Indians refused to leave low-lying areas and head to
shelters set up in schools. Twenty fishermen were missing, the
newspaper La Prensa reported.
</P>
<P>
Communication to the area was largely cut off, making it
difficult to find out what was happening as the storm's winds
began hitting the remote, swampy area, much of it reachable only
by canoe. The Nicaraguan government sent in some soldiers before
the storm hit, but was preparing to send in more help once the
hurricane passed.
</P>
<P>
Flores, who said he was getting radio reports from officials sent
in before the storm, said there were no immediate reports of
casualties.
</P>
<P>
In the seaside resort of La Ceiba, residents spent the night
reinforcing flimsy house walls with plywood and sandbags.
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be strong, but we have faith that Christ will
protect us," said 37-year-old housewife Sandra Hernandez,
watching satellite images of the storm on television.
</P>
<P>
Off Mexico's Pacific coast, meanwhile, Henriette strengthened
into a hurricane and was on a path to hit the tip of the Baja
California Peninsula on Tuesday afternoon. The had sustained
winds of 120 kph (75 mph).
</P>
<P>
At 8 a.m. EDT (1200 GMT) it was centered about 120 kilometers (80
miles) south-southeast of the peninsula.
</P>
<P>
Before dawn Tuesday, strong waves pounded the resort's beaches,
rain fell in sheets and strong winds whipped palm trees. More
than 100 residents spent the night in makeshift shelters as the
storm approached, and more were expected to leave their homes
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, police in Cabo San Lucas said high surf stirred up by
Henriette led to the drowning of an unidentified woman. Over the
weekend, the storm caused flooding and landslides that killed six
people in Acapulco.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, in the final hours before Hurricane Felix was
expected to hit, Grupo Taca Airlines frantically airlifted
tourists from the Honduran island of Roatan, popular for its
pristine reefs and diving resorts, while the U.S. Southern
Command said in a statement that a Chinook helicopter evacuated
19 U.S. citizens, including tourists and members of U.S. Joint
Task Force-Bravo who were visiting the island.
</P>
<P>
Another 1,000 people were removed from low-lying coastal areas
and smaller islands.
</P>
<P>
Bob Shearer, 54, from Butler, Pennsylvania, said he was
disappointed his family's scuba diving trip to Roatan was cut
short by the evacuation order.
</P>
<P>
"I only got seven dives in. I hope they didn't jump the gun too
soon," he said as he waited for a flight home in the San Pedro
Sula airport.
</P>
<P>
Felix was projected to rake central Honduras, slam into Guatemala
and then cut across southern Mexico, well south of Texas.
</P>
<P>
Its massive storm surge could devastate Indian communities along
the Miskito Coast, an isolated region straddling the Honduras-
Nicaragua border where Miskito Indians live in wooden shacks, get
around on canoes and subsist on fish, beans, rice, cassava and
plantains. Thousands were stranded along the coast late Monday.
</P>
<P>
The only path to safety is up rivers and across lakes that are
too shallow for regular boats, but many lack gasoline for long
journeys. Provincial health official Efrain Burgos estimated that
18,000 people must find their own way to higher ground.
</P>
<P>
The storm was following the same path as 1998's Hurricane Mitch,
a sluggish storm that stalled for a week over Central America,
killing nearly 11,000 people and leaving more than 8,000 missing,
mostly in Honduras and Nicaragua.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. National Hurricane Center said Felix could dump up to 30
centimeters (12 inches) of rain in isolated parts of northern
Honduras and northeastern Nicaragua, possibly bringing flash
floods and mudslides. In the highland capital of Tegucigalpa,
more than 160 kilometers (100 miles) inland, authorities cleared
vendors from markets prone to flooding.
</P>
<P>
Across the border in Belize City, skies grew increasingly cloudy
and winds kicked up as residents boarded windows and lined up for
gas. Tourists competed for the last seats on flights to Atlanta
and Miami. Police went door-to-door forcing evacuations.
