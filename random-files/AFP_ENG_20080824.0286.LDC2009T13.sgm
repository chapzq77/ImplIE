Suu Kyi's party says UN Myanmar visit was a 'waste of time'
</HEADLINE>

Myanmar's opposition party led by Aung San Suu Kyi on Sunday
labeled a recent visit by a UN envoy "a waste of time" as the
ruling junta continued to trumpet its own vision of
democracy.Ibrahim Gambari, the United Nations' most senior
negotiator with Myanmar, left the country Saturday after failing
to secure a meeting with Aung San Suu Kyi, who is kept under
house arrest by the ruling generals.
</P>
<P>
The junta said that the Nobel peace prize winner had refused to
see Gambari, and on Sunday printed pictures in its New Light of
Myanmar newspaper of his entourage waiting in vain outside her
lakeside home in Yangon.
</P>
<P>
Nyan Win, a spokesman for the opposition National League for
Democracy (NLD) party, said he did not know why their leader was
unable to meet Gambari, but said no key demands of the democracy
movement had been resolved.
</P>
<P>
"I have read reports in the newspaper that the authorities did
not reply to the two aims of Mr. Gambari's mission," Nyan Win
told AFP.
</P>
<P>
"One is to release political prisoners including Daw Aung San Suu
Kyi and the other is the dialogue between the government and Daw
Aung San Suu Kyi," he said, using an honorific to describe the
pro-democracy leader.
</P>
<P>
"In conclusion, Mr. Gambari's visit resulted in no improvement
and was a waste of time."
</P>
<P>
Aung San Suu Kyi led the NLD to a landslide election victory in
1990, but was never allowed to govern.
</P>
<P>
The military regime instead unveiled its own "road map" to
democracy and after more than a decade of delays drafted a new
constitution, which was approved in a referendum in May.
</P>
<P>
The junta says the charter will set the stage for elections in
2010, but the pro-democracy movement says the process simply
enthrones the army's position in the nation it has ruled since
1962.
</P>
<P>
"We firmly believe that the way to bring about democracy
peacefully is the seven-step road map," Information Minister Kyaw
Hsan said in comments to Gambari published in the New Light of
Myanmar on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
He also told Gambari: "We have made all necessary arrangements
for Your Excellency to meet with Daw Aung San Suu Kyi. Your
Excellency also wished to meet with her and tried your best."
</P>
<P>
Gambari flew to Yangon last Monday hoping to revive talks between
Aung San Suu Kyi and the regime, but he was shunned by her and
the junta's senior leadership, meeting only the prime minister,
who holds little power.
</P>
<P>
In a statement released late Saturday, the United Nations said
only that Gambari held "open and extensive meetings" with Prime
Minister Thein Sein.
