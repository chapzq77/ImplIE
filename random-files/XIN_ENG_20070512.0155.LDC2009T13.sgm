BEIJING, May 12 (Xinhua)
</P>
<P>
Beijing police has detained a man who attempted to burn the
portrait of late Chinese leader Chairman Mao Zedong that  hangs
above the gate to the Forbidden City across the street from
Tian'anmen Square.
</P>
<P>
Gu Haiou, 35, a jobless man from Urumqi, capital of Xinjiang
Uygur Autonomous Region, hurled a self-made burning object to the
portrait around 5:46 p.m. Saturday, which caused a slight burnt
mark in the lower left part of the portrait, said the Beijing
Public Security Bureau.
</P>
<P>
Gu arrived in Beijing at noon on Saturday, the bureau said.
</P>
<P>
He was once treated in a mental disease hospital in Urumqi last
year, it said.
</P>
<P>
Police are still interrogating the man.
</P>
<P>
The Tian'anmen Administration Committee will replace the damaged
portrait with a new one of the same version Saturday night, the
bureau said.
</P>
<P>
Armed police are guarding the area and visitors are forbidden to
enter the Forbidden City.
</P>
<P>
But the Tian'anmen Square is still open to visitors.
</P>
<P>
The portrait, six meters high, five meters wide and weighing
about two tons, is a reproduction of the fourth edition of Mao's
portrait that has hung at the historic spot since New China was
founded in 1949.
</P>
<P>
The first edition painted in 1949 showed Mao wearing a military
uniform and a cap. The second edition, hung between 1950 and
1952, showed Mao in a green suit. The third edition, painted in
the 1950s by portraitist Zhang Zhenshi, was put up between 1953
and 1968.
