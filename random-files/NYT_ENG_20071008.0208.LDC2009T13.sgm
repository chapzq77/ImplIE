PHOTOGRAPHER WINS $1.32 MILLION IN DIGITAL COPYRIGHT SUIT

<P>
A Seattle-based photographer has won $1.32 million in a copyright
infringement lawsuit against him by a former client, Auburn-based
shoemaker Prop?t USA Inc.
</P>
<P>
The case is believed to be the first to rule in favor of a
photographer under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, a 1998
federal law addressing ownership rights to digital works.
</P>
<P>
Lloyd Shugart, sole proprietor of Studio 413 in Sodo, won the
federal court victory against Prop?t late last month. Prop?t has
asked U.S. District Magistrate Judge Mary Alice Theiler to reject
or reduce the jury verdict in Shugart's favor, and that request
is set to be argued Thursday, said Philip Mann, a Seattle
attorney representing Shugart.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Shugart, 50, said Monday that he's exhausted after the
20-month proceeding.
</P>
<P>
"I do feel vindicated," he added. "It restored my faith in the
legal system. The jury paid close attention."
</P>
<P>
Mann declared the case "a triumph of the little guy against the
big guy. It's one of these things where the system works for a
change."
</P>
<P>
Prop?t attorney Bruce Kaser declined to comment because the
litigation is ongoing.
</P>
<P>
Shugart, an independent contractor, photographed Prop?t's
products from about 1999 through 2005. In 2005, Shugart claimed
Prop?t was using his images in unauthorized ways by letting its
international distributors and online retailers display the
photos.
</P>
<P>
To force the issue of ownership and to raise funds for a lawsuit,
Shugart prepared to sell his images of Prop?t products on eBay
for $1.3 million. But he said he never posted the ad.
</P>
<P>
Then, in January 2006, he gave Prop?t 48 hours to pay $275,000
for a one-year license to use the images, warning that if the
company did not agree to that offer, he would sue.
</P>
<P>
Prop?t preemptively sued Shugart in February 2006 to keep him
from selling any of those images or restricting Prop?t's rights
to them.
</P>
<P>
At issue was whether Prop?t had unlimited rights to use the
images it had paid Shugart to produce and whether Prop?t had
infringed on Shugart's copyrights.
</P>
<P>
A jury on Sept. 27 ordered Prop?t to pay Shugart $12,800 in
actual damages from copy infringement, $500,000 for damages owed
under the copyright laws, $500,000 for Prop?t's removal of
copyright-management information from the images and $303,000 for
failing to return some original images.
</P>
<P>
Mann and Shugart couldn't account for the fact that the total
value of the jury award equaled the amount Shugart had planned to
seek for the images on eBay.
</P>
<P>
"We gave the jury a range of values, and whether it's coincidence
or not, I don't know," Mann said.
</P>
<P>
The case, "so far as we know," is the first to rule in favor of a
photographer under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, Mann
said. In the past, such claims have failed because they haven't
shown that clients intentionally removed copyright information,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Shugart said the case's lesson for photographers is that they
should register all images with the U.S. Copyright Office before
releasing them to clients.
</P>
<P>
"Officially your copyright exists the second you create an image,
but to protect that copyright, it has to be registered. This is
extremely important to keep in mind," he said. "The axiom that
the copyright is created when the image is created means
nothing."
