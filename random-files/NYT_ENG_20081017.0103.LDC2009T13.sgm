OBAMA, MCCAIN SLUG AWAY ON IMMIGRATION ISSUES -- BUT ONLY IN
SPANISH

SAN ANTONIO
</P>
<P>
Unknown to most of the country, the two presidential contenders
have been slugging away at each other on immigration issues --
through Spanish-language advertisements in crucial swing states
where growing Latino populations could ultimately sway the
election.
</P>
<P>
The ads, running on Spanish-language television and radio in
states such as Colorado, Nevada and New Mexico, feature Democrat
Barack Obama and Republican John McCain pointing fingers at each
other for not having done enough on immigration.
</P>
<P>
McCain launched the opening salvo by blaming Obama for the
collapse of last year's controversial Senate bill seeking to
overhaul the U.S. immigration system.
</P>
<P>
Obama countered with his own Spanish ad linking McCain to the
extreme-right Republican wing, widely seen as anti-immigrant.
</P>
<P>
And so ensued a series of ongoing volleys on an issue that, until
eclipsed by rising concerns over the economic meltdown, had
retained national interest.
</P>
<P>
Though the ads mostly dish out criticism and fall short of
offering solutions to the immigration problem, it's no
coincidence they're being offered only on Spanish-language
airwaves, experts said.
</P>
<P>
Even before the economy took over as the top campaign issue,
neither candidate took the initiative to bring up immigration on
the trail because both actually share similar views and neither
saw a clear opening to gain political muscle.
</P>
<P>
"Immigration has been complicated, heated and polarizing,"
explained Audrey Singer, immigration policy analyst at the
Brookings Institution in Washington, D.C. "Definitely not what
you want to talk about in the last couple of weeks of the
election."
</P>
<P>
By keeping the discussion limited to Spanish, both candidates
have found they could seek crucial Hispanic votes while keeping
the issue under the mainstream radar, said Federico Subervi, who
teaches journalism and mass communication at Texas State
University in San Marcos.
</P>
<P>
It's niche political advertising taken to a higher strategic
level because it's only in Spanish, noted Subervi, director of
the university's Center for the Study of Latino Media and
Markets.
</P>
<P>
"Through these attack ads, they've found a safe way to make their
case on who's the best candidate for Latinos," Subervi said.
"They've found a common denominator that's not offensive to the
broader public."
</P>
<P>
Each campaign's point person for Hispanic media accused the
other's boss of being the culprit of the ad war while avoiding a
direct answer on why it's being conducted only in Spanish.
</P>
<P>
Federico de Jesus, spokesman for Obama, said McCain started it
all by issuing Spanish ads smearing Obama's record on immigration
-- and the Obama camp was forced to respond in kind.
</P>
<P>
Unlike McCain, who's only willing to tackle immigration in
Spanish so he won't get burned by his party's more restrictionist
base, de Jesus said, Obama shares his views in both languages.
</P>
<P>
"We don't have anything to fear or hide," he said.
</P>
<P>
But the fact that Obama always waits for his opponent to take the
first step in tackling immigration proves a total lack of
leadership on the issue, countered Hessy Fernandez, spokeswoman
for McCain.
</P>
<P>
Although the tit-for-tat continues on or off the air, in Spanish
and English, both campaigns agree on one point: Neither is
pandering to Latinos as a one-issue voting bloc. Their views on
the economy, health care, education and national security are
just as important, de Jesus and Fernandez said.
