WASHINGTON SEEKS A WAY TO SHOUT, 'COME VISIT'
</HEADLINE>

WASHINGTON
</P>
<P>
In its hunt for slogans to lure tourists, the nation's capital
has never lit on the elegance of a "Virginia Is for Lovers" or
the panache of a "What Happens Here, Stays Here."
</P>
<P>
"A Capital City" was fine for awhile, until Washington's high
murder rate in the late 1980s produced an unwanted double
meaning.
</P>
<P>
And while residents lined up for "Taxation Without
Representation" license plates in 2000, that tagline was more
local protest than tourist come-on.
</P>
<P>
This time, the District of Columbia is taking a more studious
approach. Tourism officials have hired two brand research firms
to convene focus groups and conduct international surveys of
attitudes toward the capital.
</P>
<P>
In addition, a Web site, shareyourdc.com, invites the city's
582,000 residents -- and anyone else, for that matter -- to
propose slogans and take part in weekly polls.
</P>
<P>
"This isn't a few people sitting around a room saying, 'Hey,
let's come up with this slogan,"' said Dan Mesches, president of
Star Restaurant Group and chairman of the city's Brand Strategy
Task Force, a panel of local leaders in business, travel and the
arts. "This is an extensive and exhaustive search for what people
in town are thinking and what people out of town are thinking."
</P>
<P>
A sampling of submissions range from sober epigrams like "The
City of National Monuments" to playful one-liners like "It's
Capital, by George" and "Your Party's Here!"
</P>
<P>
Local blogs have been flooded with more irreverent proposals.
"Mistakes Were Made," "Where Attorneys Roam" and "Dude, Where's
My Car?" are some of the printable ones.
</P>
<P>
Mayor Adrian M. Fenty said he wanted a catchphrase that braids
the themes of "unity, energy and renaissance."
</P>
<P>
"You want to have a slogan where people just say, 'That's what I
think about when I think about the nation's capital,"' said
Fenty, 36, who took office in January as the city's youngest
mayor. "We want it to touch people. We want it to resonate with
people. We also want it to have a high degree of accuracy."
</P>
<P>
With the White House, the Capitol and oceans of white marble
monuments and museums, Washington has rarely wanted for busloads
of fifth-graders on field trips or families on a been-there-done-
that weekend of sightseeing. In 2005, the last year of available
figures, some 15 million visitors spent $5 billion here,
generating $543 million in tax revenue for the city.
</P>
<P>
Though the search for a slogan has captured the most attention,
it is part of a larger "branding" initiative to spice up the
city's image.
</P>
<P>
Victoria Isley, a tourism official here, said the campaign, set
to start in the fall, would try in part to sell higher-income
visitors on the "D.C. beyond C-Span" -- a growing arts and
nightlife scene, newly vibrant neighborhoods and a crop of new
hotels, theaters and restaurants.
</P>
<P>
"There is an old stereotype that I think still exists -- that
Washington is not that fun, it closes after dark, it's a one-note
town," said Keith Bellows, editor in chief of National Geographic
Traveler and an adviser to the brand task force. "If you want to
broaden people's perspective, you need to take a different tack."
</P>
<P>
At his gallery in the Georgetown neighborhood, Keith Lipert, in a
sharp blue bow tie, put his hand to his chin as he mulled the
question of a new slogan.
</P>
<P>
"To me, it would be something along the lines of, 'Rediscover
Washington,"' Lipert said. "This city in the last 10 years has
gone through remarkable changes: great music, great theater,
great restaurants."
</P>
<P>
Across town, in the hard-luck neighborhood of Anacostia, people
said jobs, safe streets and affordable housing were more pressing
than a new catchphrase.
</P>
<P>
"'A Capital City,"' proposed Juan Lyles, 56, a computer operator
waiting for a bus. "But meaning money, rather than the capital."
</P>
<P>
With neighborhoods gentrifying and high-priced condos popping up
across the city, Lyles said, "it's getting out of reach of most
of the indigenous population."
