</HEADLINE>

<P>
US stocks closed lower Monday on concerns over corporate earnings
and plunging retail sales as well as deteriorating US commercial
property values in an economy reeling from prolonged recession.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 59.18 points (0.69 percent)

more than 200 points.
</P>
<P>
The tech-rich Nasdaq gave up 31.97 points (2.04 percent) to
1,532.35 as large- cap technology stocks dragged the index lower.
</P>

The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 broad-market index also fell 16.24
points (1.83 percent) to 871.64.

Wall Street opened Monday with more bleak news as Japan's iconic
Toyota auto company forecast its first ever operating loss,
European stocks plunged on pre- Christmas gloom and China's
central bank further cut interest rates to cope with the global
economic downturn.
</P>
<P>
As trading began in a Christmas holiday-shortened week, stocks
continued their slide with technology and financials particularly
weak, said market analysis firm Charles Schwab &amp; Co.
</P>
<P>
"Life insurance companies are down on worries about commercial
mortgage defaults" after the Wall Street Journal reported that
property developers had asked the government for assistance, it
said.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper reported Monday that with a record amount of
commercial real estate debt coming due, some of the country's
biggest property developers had become the latest to go hat-in-
hand to the government for assistance.
</P>
<P>
The developers warned policymakers that thousands of office
complexes, hotels, shopping centers and other commercial
buildings were headed into defaults, foreclosures and
bankruptcies, the report said.
</P>
<P>
US retailers were also struggling "amid fears that steep
discounts have been used to entice consumer spending, and that
cold and snowy weather in many markets weighed down holiday
spending," Schwab &amp; Co said.
</P>
<P>
Further adding to the overall dismal attitude on Wall Street
Monday were the less-than-stellar corporate earnings outlooks,
said Colleen King of Schaeffer's Investment Research.
</P>
<P>
"Light share volume on the New York Stock Exchange seemed to
exacerbate the session's weakness," said analysts at Briefing.
com in a report.
</P>
<P>
"However, the stock market was still able to pare losses by
reversing course late in the session," it said.
</P>
<P>
Early declines were led by large-cap technology stocks, but
weakness soon expanded into the broader market.
</P>
<P>
"Still, tech's influence caused the Nasdaq to lag its
counterparts from beginning to end," Briefing.com said.
</P>
<P>
Financial stocks were the worst performers as investors continue
to shun banks and other financial institutions. Wells Fargo was
down 6.61 percent to 27.42 dollars, among the lagging movers in
the sector.
</P>
<P>
Walgreen, one of the country's largest drug store chains, fell
4.22 percent to 24.98 dollars after its profit fell 10 percent in
its fiscal first quarter, lower than expected.
</P>
<P>
Following Toyota's lackluster outlook, the struggling US
automakers also traded lower as a group.
</P>
<P>
Ford lost 12.20 percent to 2.59 dollars while General Motors
plunged 21.60 percent to 3.52 dollars even after President George
W. Bush ordered a 13.4 billion dollar rescue loan for the
automakers while demanding tough reforms in return in a move
aimed at staving off a new economic calamity.
</P>
<P>
The energy sector traded modestly as crude oil prince continued

yielding 2.141 percent, higher than the 2.131 percent on Friday,
while that on the 30-year bond climbed to 2.598 percent from
2.562 percent. Bond yields and prices move in opposite
directions.
