North Korea said Saturday that at least 600 people are dead or
missing following devastating floods, twice the previous official
toll.
</P>
<P>
Torrential rain, strong winds and landslides left at least 600
people dead or missing and thousands of people injured, the
official Korean Central News Agency said, citing figures from the
Central Statistics Bureau.

<P>
Official figures quoted by relief agencies earlier spoke of about
300 dead or missing.

The agency, in its starkest assessment so far of the damage, said
the downpours earlier this month "caused huge material losses to
the (country), creating unprecedented difficulties in people's
living and economic construction."
</P>
<P>
It said the homes of at least 240,000 families were totally or
partially destroyed or inundated, leaving at least 100,000 people
totally homeless and some 900,000 others flood-stricken.
</P>
<P>
It said more than 8,000 public buildings, schools, thousands of
health service institutions and nurseries were totally or partly
destroyed, along with more than 1,000 major production facilities
such as mine complexes and factories.
