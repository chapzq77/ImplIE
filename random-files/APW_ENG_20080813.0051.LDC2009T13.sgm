Violent Texas inmate executed for double slaying
</HEADLINE>

HUNTSVILLE, Texas 2008-08-13 00:28:06 UTC
</P>
<P>
A twice-convicted killer with a history of violence that
continued even after he was sent to death row was executed
Tuesday for gunning down two video store workers during a robbery
14 years ago in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
"I love all y'all. I forgive all y'all. See y'all when you get
there," Leon David Dorsey IV said in his final statement. "Do
what you're going to do."
</P>
<P>
Dorsey, 32, acknowledged his sister when witnesses filed in but
didn't direct any comments to the relatives of his victims.
</P>
<P>
He was pronounced dead nine minutes after the lethal drugs began
to flow.
</P>
<P>
Dorsey was the seventh prisoner executed this year in America's
most active death penalty state and the first of two inmates
scheduled to die this week. Two more are to die next week.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Supreme Court earlier this year upheld his conviction
and death sentence and no late appeals were filed to try to block
Dorsey's lethal injection.
</P>
<P>
Prison records showed that since Dorsey arrived on death row
eight years ago, he's had at least 95 disciplinary cases,
including a 2004 attack where he used an home-made knife to stab
an officer 14 times in the back. The officer's body armor
prevented serious injuries.
</P>
<P>
Less than two weeks ago, authorities recovered another shank from
his cell. His threats of violence kept prison officials from
making him available for media interviews as his execution date
approached and his frequent disciplinary issues kept him in a
prison system classification reserved for the most troublesome
inmates. But prison officials said he offered no resistance as he
was led to the death chamber.
</P>
<P>
"He's mean," Toby Shook, a former Dallas County assistant
district attorney who prosecuted Dorsey for capital murder, said,
calling him a "true psychopath."
</P>
<P>
Dorsey already was in prison, serving 60 years after pleading
guilty to killing a woman during a convenience store robbery,
when a Dallas police cold case squad gathered enough evidence to
tie him to the unsolved shooting deaths four years earlier of
James Armstrong, 26, and Brad Lindsey, 20, at a Blockbuster Video
store in East Dallas where they worked.
</P>
<P>
Evidence showed Dorsey, who called himself "Pistol Pete," cased
the place on Easter Sunday night in 1994, then returned after
midnight to steal $392 from a cash register. He shot the workers
when Armstrong had difficulty opening a safe at gunpoint and
Lindsey tried to run.
</P>
<P>
Most of the crime was recorded on security cameras in the store.
</P>
<P>
When the case was reopened in 1998, Dallas authorities had the
tape analyzed by the FBI and determined Dorsey could have been
the gunman.
</P>
<P>
Five months after the video store killings, Dorsey killed a 51
-year-old Korean woman, Hyon Suk Chon, at the convenience store
she managed in Ennis, south of Dallas. He was in prison for that
slaying when he was questioned again about the double slaying and
confessed.
</P>
<P>
Dorsey also admitted the murders to a reporter in an interview
from prison while he was awaiting trial.
</P>
<P>
"I've done cut folks; I've done stabbed folks; I've killed
folks," he told The Dallas Morning News. "But it don't bother
me."
</P>
<P>
Dorsey at age 12 moved to Waxahachie to live with his
grandparents after he was booted from Germany where his mother
was stationed in the Air Force. Records show when he was 14 he
took a gun to school and fired it. At 16, he fired at a couple
driving in a car.
</P>
<P>
"He'd walk down the street with a sawed-off shotgun tied to his
arm and with a coat on and then just throw it open -- just to see
the reaction of people," Shook said. "He's a piece of work."
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Michael Rodriguez, one of the infamous "Texas 7"
prison escapees, has volunteered for execution for his part in
the fatal shooting of a Dallas-area police officer, Aubrey
Hawkins, during a robbery while he and the six other escapees
were fugitives in December 2000.
