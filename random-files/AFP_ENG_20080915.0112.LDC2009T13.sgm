Football: Fagan sidelined with broken leg after horror tackle
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hull City striker Craig Fagan could be out for three months after
a dreadful challenge by Newcastle's Danny Guthrie left the
forward with a broken leg.
</P>
<P>
Fagan was shielding the ball in the corner, looking to play out
time in Premier League new boys Hull's 2-1 win away to Newcastle
on Saturday when Guthrie ploughed straight into the back of Fagan
and then received a straight red card.
</P>
<P>
His sending off compounded a miserable match for Newcastle, which
came just a day before owner Mike Ashley put the club up for sale
in response to protests by fans who blamed him for the exit of
popular manager Kevin Keegan.
</P>
<P>
Fagan left the ground on crutches and Hull confirmed Monday that
an X-ray had revealed the 25-year-old former Derby forward had
suffered a fractured right tibia, which could keep him out of
action for between six weeks and three months.
</P>
<P>
Angry Tigers manager Phil Brown said there was no excuse for
Guthrie's tackle, telling the Hull Daily Mail: "It cannot be
tolerated, it needs to be kicked out of the game.
</P>
<P>
"When you see that the end product is him putting a fellow pro in
a cast, it's just not right.
</P>
<P>
"That's the horrible side of the game. I don't care what is going
on at Newcastle, you cannot tolerate this.
</P>
<P>
"If I go back to the incident, my players were killing time in
the corner, something that every Premier League club does, no
matter who you are.
</P>
<P>
"In the process of doing that, someone has decided to take the
matter into his own hands and lashed out at Craig Fagan."
</P>
<P>
A contrite Guthrie insisted later Monday his challenge had been
"totally out of character", telling Newcastle's official website:
"I was very upset to hear the news concerning Craig.
</P>
<P>
"The club have been in touch with Hull City on my behalf because
I want to speak to Craig in person to apologise and wish him a
speedy recovery. I hope to be able to do that as soon as
possible.
</P>
<P>
"It was a challenge that came purely out of frustration towards
the end of Saturday's game, but anybody who knows me will accept
it was totally out of character on my part."
