Eurozone finance chiefs see looming growth, inflation risks
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Eurozone finance chiefs warned on Friday that the 15-nation bloc
faced growing risks to economic growth and inflation, but
insisted there was currently no threat of a recession.
</P>
<P>
"Headwinds are materialising for growth," Luxembourg Finance
Minister Jean- Claude Juncker said after chairing a meeting with
his eurozone counterparts, also describing the bloc's economic
performance as "satisfying."
</P>
<P>
"There has been a cyclical slowdown but not worse than that and
certainly no prospect of recession," he told reporters in Brdo
pri Kranju, Slovenia, near Ljubljana. "The US and the eurozone
are certainly different in that respect."
</P>
<P>
EU Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner Joaquin Almunia
also acknowledged that "downside risks have increased" since he
forecast in February that the eurozone economy would grow 1.8
percent this year.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Almunia said eurozone finance ministers expected a
"better scenario" than the International Monetary Fund's recently
reduced forecast for 1.3 percent growth this year in the bloc.
</P>
<P>
He blamed the bleaker outlook on the current financial crisis,
which he said was lasting longer than previously expected.
</P>
<P>
"The longer these tensions will be maintained the greater the
risks are the financial market turmoil will be transmitted to the
real economy," he said. "We are receiving some negative impacts
in our economies."
</P>
<P>
Although German Finance Minister Peer Steinbrueck saw no quick
fix for the turmoil in the financial sector, he also warned
against overreacting as he arrived for the meeting.
</P>
<P>
"It's going to keep us busy throughout 2008, but I advise against
getting hysterical about it," he said.
</P>
<P>
Eurozone finance ministers, who were to be joined later by
counterparts from all EU countries for a two-day meeting, are
struggling to come up with concrete responses to the growing
threats hovering over their economy.
</P>
<P>
Though under pressure to try to counter the financial crisis,
deep divisions on the best strategy have so far kept the European
finance ministers from taking concerted action.
</P>
<P>
Huge new write-downs this week by Swiss bank UBS and Deutsche
Bank of Germany added to the sense of urgency ahead of the
meeting of EU finance ministers and central bankers in Slovenia,
which currently holds the EU's rotating presidency.
</P>
<P>
While the outlook for economic growth was falling, Almunia said
inflation was rising and would probably top the 2.6 percent he
forecast for 2008 in February.
</P>
<P>
Although eurozone finance ministers were "concerned" but not "on
the pessimistic side" regarding economic growth, Almunia said "we
are extremely concerned on the inflation side."
</P>
<P>
Inflation in the 15 eurozone countries jumped in March to 3.5
percent -- the highest level since the bloc was formed in 1999,
according to official EU data earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
Slovenian Finance Minister Andrej Bajuk warned that the currently
high inflation looked increasingly like it was not a temporary
uptick but was here to stay for some time.
</P>
<P>
"The changes that we are now seeing seem every day more of a
structural nature than just a question of short-term
development," he said.
</P>
<P>
Although the euro's record strength helps limit the cost of
dollar-denominated commodity imports like oil, it is also
weighing on exports from the eurozone.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the bloc's finance chiefs are edgy about spikes in
the euro's exchange rate.
</P>
<P>
"Excessive volatility is counterproductive from the standpoint of
global growth," ECB president Jean-Claude Trichet said. "The
recent excessive moves are an element of concern."
