Israeli, Palestinian leaders make little progress at summit
meeting

JERUSALEM 2007-03-11 18:42:23 UTC

<P>
Little progress was reported Sunday from the second summit
meeting in a month between Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and
Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas. A Palestinian participant
called it "difficult."
</P>
<P>
The two leaders met for more than two hours at Olmert's Jerusalem
residence and pledged to continue their contacts, prodded by U.S.
officials to nurture their fledgling dialogue.
</P>
<P>
In the only concrete result, an Israeli official said Olmert
pledged to keep the vital Karni cargo crossing between Israel and
Gaza open for longer hours to allow more goods to enter and exit
the seaside territory. Israel has kept Karni closed often, citing
security threats.
</P>
<P>
Larger issues standing in the way of a peace agreement between
Israel and the Palestinians -- borders, Jewish settlements,
Palestinian refugees, Jerusalem -- were apparently not even
seriously discussed at the summit. Olmert said in advance that
the talks would be limited to humanitarian issues, reflecting his
rejection of the current government headed by the violently anti-
Israel Hamas.
</P>
<P>
Olmert and Abbas walked into the residence together. The two
leaders, flanked by their aides, sat on opposite sides of a
conference table as the talks began. Olmert smiled to TV cameras
in the room as he exchanged pleasantries with Abbas.
</P>
<P>
Negotiator Mohammed Dahlan, who attended the meeting, called the
summit "difficult." He said the Palestinians called on Olmert to
fulfill his pledge to ease travel restrictions in the West Bank
by removing roadblocks, and to release sick and elderly
Palestinian prisoners from Israeli jails, but Olmert made no
promises.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli official, speaking on condition of anonymity because
the meeting was closed, said Olmert pressed Abbas to halt
Palestinian rocket fire from Gaza and arms smuggling from Egypt,
and win the release of an Israeli soldier captured in June by
Hamas-linked gunmen.
</P>
<P>
The official said Abbas hoped the soldier, Cpl. Gilad Shalit,
would be freed before the formation of a new Palestinian unity
government consisting of Hamas and Abbas' more moderate Fatah
movement.
</P>
<P>
The power-sharing deal between the two Palestinian rivals,
reached last month in the Saudi holy city of Mecca, has cast a
shadow on Mideast diplomacy because it does not meet
international demands that any Palestinian government renounce
violence, recognize Israel and commit to previous peace
agreements.
</P>
<P>
While willing to maintain ties with Abbas, Olmert says he will
not conduct peace talks with a government that includes Hamas
unless the group agrees to meet those demands.
</P>
<P>
Under the unity deal, the new government only agrees to "respect"
past agreements, falling short of the international conditions.
</P>
<P>
Dahlan said the Palestinians told Olmert the unity government is
an internal Palestinian matter, according to Dahlan's spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Sunday's meeting followed a Feb. 19 summit in Jerusalem that also
ended with little progress. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice,
who attended last month's meeting, had urged the sides to
continue talking.
</P>
<P>
Abbas has argued the unity deal with Hamas is essential to end
months of infighting. More than 130 Palestinians have been killed
in internal violence since last May, after Hamas defeated Fatah
in legislative elections.
</P>
<P>
The unity deal has brought a lull to the Gaza Strip, where the
infighting has been concentrated, but tensions remain. In the
most serious flare-up of fighting since the agreement, gunmen
from Hamas and Fatah exchanged fire early Sunday in northern
Gaza.
</P>
<P>
Mohammed Kafarneh, a local Hamas militia leader, was killed and
seven people were wounded. Hamas vowed revenge.
</P>
<P>
Ahead of Sunday's summit, Olmert announced he was ready to "treat
seriously" a dormant Saudi initiative calling for a comprehensive
peace agreement between Israel and the Arab world in exchange for
a full Israeli withdrawal from lands captured in the 1967 Mideast
War.
</P>
<P>
In the past, Israel has rejected the plan's call for a full
withdrawal from the West Bank and east Jerusalem. It also opposes
the plan's implicit endorsement of a large-scale return of
Palestinian refugees and their descendants to areas inside
Israel.
</P>
<P>
The 2002 Saudi initiative is expected to be high on the agenda of
a pan-Arab summit in Riyadh later this month. The Saudi push
comes at a time when many moderate Arab governments view progress
on the Palestinian-Israeli issue as a way to lower tensions and
to blunt the growing influence of Iran.
