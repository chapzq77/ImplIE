Judge orders Paris Hilton be brought to court for hearing

LOS ANGELES 2007-06-08 16:13:46 UTC
</P>
<P>
A judge ordered that Paris Hilton be brought to court Friday for
a hearing on her early release from jail rather than listen to
the proceeding by telephone.
</P>
<P>
The decision by Superior Court Judge Michael T. Sauer was the
latest in a flurry of developments surrounding Hilton's early
release from prison. That move sparked protests by many --
including local and state authorities and civil rights leaders --
who argued it could interpreted as affording the socialite favors
not available to other, less famous, inmates.
</P>
<P>
Sauer's decision was announced by court spokesman Allan Parachini
shortly before the start of a hearing that could put her behind
bars again for violating probation in a reckless driving case.
</P>
<P>
"Judge Sauer has instructed the Sheriff's Department to go to Ms.
Hilton's residence, pick her up and bring her here. That is
happening now," Parachini told reporters outside the courthouse.
</P>
<P>
Hilton on Thursday was originally ordered to report to court at 9
a.m. (1600 GMT) and the judge signed an order for deputies to
bring her in a sheriff's vehicle from her home, said Allan
Parachini. But early Friday, Parachini had announced that she
would be allowed to take part in the hearing by telephone. He
said he understood that was her attorney's desire and it was not
unusual for phones to be used in misdemeanor cases.
</P>
<P>
Outside the courthouse, people on other business stopped to gawk
at news cameras. One of them was Moses Baltazar who was
attempting to clear up his own traffic ticket. He said he was no
fan of Hilton, noting she once tipped him only a dollar when he
worked as a valet, even though he helped keep paparazzi away from
her.
</P>
<P>
He also said there was no excuse for her flouting the law.
"Driving like that, you have to behave. If you're rich, you have
money, you have to respect yourself," he said, adding he thinks
she should be returned to jail.
</P>
<P>
The frenzy began early Thursday when sheriff's officials released
Hilton because of an undisclosed medical condition and sent her
to her Hollywood Hills home under house arrest where she was to
serve out the remainder of her 45-day sentence. She had spent
three days, and was credited for five.
</P>
<P>
Hilton was fitted with an electronic monitoring ankle bracelet
and was expected to finish the sentence for a reckless driving
probation violation at her four-bedroom, three-bath home. In
jail, she was expected to serve just 23 days.
</P>
<P>
The decision by Sheriff Lee Baca to move Hilton chafed
prosecutors and Sauer, who spelled out during sentencing that
Hilton was not allowed to serve house detention. Late Thursday,
Sauer issued the order for Hilton to return to court after the
city attorney filed a petition demanding that Hilton be returned
to jail and to show cause why Baca should not be held in contempt
of court.
</P>
<P>
Baca does not have to be in court, and it was unclear who would
represent the Sheriff's Department.
</P>
<P>
The move also was met with outrage from the sheriff's deputies
union, members of the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors,
civil rights leaders, defense attorneys and others.
</P>
<P>
"What transpired here is outrageous," county Supervisor Don Knabe
told The Associated Press, adding he received more than 400 angry
e-mails and hundreds more phone calls from around the country.
</P>
<P>
Hilton's return home "gives the impression of ... celebrity
justice being handed out," he said.
</P>
<P>
Baca dismissed the criticism, saying the decision was made based
on medical advice.
</P>
<P>
"It isn't wise to keep a person in jail with her problem over an
extended period of time and let the problem get worse," Baca told
the Los Angeles Times on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"My message to those who don't like celebrities is that punishing
celebrities more than the average American is not justice," Baca
said.
</P>
<P>
California Attorney General Jerry Brown criticized the Sheriff's
Department for letting Hilton out of jail, saying he believed she
should serve out her sentence.
</P>
<P>
"It does hold up the system to ridicule when the powerful and the
famous get special treatment," Brown told The Associated Press in
an interview before testifying at a congressional hearing in
Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure there's a lot of people who've seen their family
members go to jail and have various ailments, physical and
psychological, that didn't get them released," he said. "I'd say
it's time for a course correction."
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles County jail system is so overcrowded that
attorneys and jail officials have said it is not unusual for
nonviolent offenders like Hilton to be released after serving as
little as 10 percent of their sentences.
</P>
<P>
In the hours after Hilton's release, it was a madcap scene
outside her house in the hills above the Sunset Strip. As word
spread that the 26-year-old poster child for bad celebrity
behavior was back home, radio helicopter pilots who normally
report on traffic conditions were dispatched to hover over her
house and describe it to morning commuters. Paparazzi
photographers on the ground quickly assembled outside its gates.
</P>
<P>
Shortly before noon, Hilton issued a statement through her
attorney.
</P>
<P>
"I want to thank the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department and
staff of the Century Regional Detention Center for treating me
fairly and professionally," she said. "I am going to serve the
remaining 40 days of my sentence. I have learned a great deal
from this ordeal and hope that others have learned from my
mistakes."
</P>
<P>
Hilton's path to jail began Sept. 7, when she failed a sobriety
test after police saw her weaving down a street in her Mercedes-
Benz on what she said was a late-night run to a hamburger stand.
</P>
<P>
She pleaded no contest to reckless driving and was sentenced to
36 months' probation, alcohol education and $1,500 (euro1,124) in
fines.
</P>
<P>
In the months that followed she was stopped twice by officers who
discovered her driving on a suspended license. The second stop
landed her in Sauer's courtroom, where he sentenced her to jail.
