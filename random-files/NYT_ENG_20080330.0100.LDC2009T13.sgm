THORNTON HAD THE UPPER HANDS
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Against Ottawa, Bruins' Thornton had the upper hands
</P>
<P>
His name is not on the scoring summary, but Shawn Thornton left
an impression in the Bruins' 4-0 victory over the Ottawa Senators
yesterday. Twice the burly fourth-line wing saw a teammate
knocked to the ice and stepped into the offending Senator with
his fists cocked, standing up for his teammate, hockey-style.
</P>
<P>
Thornton left impressions of his knuckles on the faces of Chris
Neil and Cody Bass, and that left an impression on his teammates,
and his coach.
</P>
<P>
"I love this time of year," said Thornton, who signed with the
Bruins last summer after earning a Stanley Cup ring with the
Anaheim Ducks. "It's the best time of year to play - the last
10-15 games and the playoffs, that's what you're playing for. As
a kid, no one's saying, 'It's Game 22, who wants to play for the
Cup?' when you're playing road hockey."
</P>
<P>
The Bruins, locked in a final-stretch struggle to make the
playoffs, want and probably need points from their final four
games to ensure a top-eight spot in the Eastern Conference.
</P>
<P>
It took a while for the Bruins to uncork their offense, and
Thornton helped shake it loose. The first period was slogging
along scoreless when Neil caught Jeremy Reich at the Ottawa blue
line with an elbow, forcing Reich from the game with a head
injury. A few minutes later, Thornton called Neil aside and
opened up a little chat with his fists.
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't so much to set the tone as retribution for the hit on
Reicher," said Thornton. "I didn't see it because I was
forechecking right away.
</P>
<P>
"We know what's on the line, all 20 guys are playing hard and
that's the best thing it's done. We're down again after ((Reich))
left, and everyone pulled up their socks again, so congrats to
everyone for standing in there."
</P>
<P>
P.J. Axelsson and Marco Sturm scored early in the second period,
but then Senators rookie Bass barreled into Mark Stuart behind
the Bruins net, arriving perhaps a bit late to an already crowded
scrum. Stuart skated slowly off the ice with his left arm
hanging.
</P>
<P>
Thornton was incensed. Or maybe just pumped up. His body language
betrayed his rink rage.
</P>
<P>
No time to chat, Cody Bass, say hello to my fist.
</P>
<P>
"I thought it was a high-stick ((on Stuart))," said Thornton. "It
was more reactionary than anything else. I had just come on the
ice and I saw Stuart laying there.
</P>
<P>
"It's our house and I don't want people taking liberties with one
of my teammates, especially if I'm on the ice. I'm not going to
let that slide."
</P>
<P>
Though Stuart returned a few minutes later (he called the injury
to his right arm a "stinger"), Thornton had made his point.
</P>
<P>
"First of all, we know what he did to step up and protect our
players because there were a couple of questionable hits there,"
said Bruins coach Claude Julien. "He stepped up and did his job
that way.
</P>
<P>
"Also, what hopefully didn't go unnoticed is that he played a
solid game, too. He was good along the wall, he was skating well,
he got pucks in deep, and he played a pretty good hockey game
tonight.
</P>
<P>
"You have a tendency to think of those guys as one-dimensional
players, but he played more and more as the game went on because
he was so reliable."
</P>
<P>
Stuart acknowledged the game is a little easier knowing Thornton
is around. "Teams know what Shawn is going to bring to a game,"
Stuart said.
</P>
<P>
Thornton, who has four goals and three assists in 54 games, had a
slow start to the season, and missed 20 games with a foot injury,
but returned in mid-December, leaner and fitter, and just as
mean.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think there's anybody in the league I haven't got my
mitts off with," he said. "I can take care of myself, and if that
has to be done, I don't put too much thought into it.
</P>
<P>
"Our line did a pretty good job going out there and maybe
controlling the play in the other team's end and getting some
bangs in. There's other ways to change momentum ((than
fighting)), we've figured that out as a line, and we've been
trying to do our best."
