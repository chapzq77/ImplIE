A 6.8-magnitude earthquake rocked Japan's northwest coast on
Monday, killing at least two people. The quake injured more than
260 people, flattened dozens of wooden buildings and triggered a
fire at a nuclear power plant.
</P>
<P>
Fire sirens could be heard in hard-hit Kashiwazaki city, and
older buildings were reduced to piles of lumber. National
broadcaster NHK reported more than 260 people were hurt, with
injuries including broken bones, cuts and bruises.
</P>
<P>
Two women in Kashiwazaki died, an official at Kashiwazaki Central
Hospital said on condition of anonymity, citing hospital
protocol. NHK reported that the women were in their 80s and had
been buried in separate buildings.
</P>
<P>
"I was so scared -- the violent shaking went on for 20 seconds,"
Ritei Wakatsuki, an employee of convenience store Lawson, told
The Associated Press by telephone from Kashiwazaki. "I almost
fainted by the fear of shaking."
</P>
<P>
Flames and billows of black smoke poured from the Kashiwazaki
nuclear plant, which automatically shut down during the quake.
The fire, at an electrical transformer, was put out shortly after
noon and there was no release of radioactivity or damage to the
reactors, said Motoyasu Tamaki, a Tokyo Electric Power Co.
</P>
<P>
Some 440 people were evacuated from the quake zone, NHK reported.
The force of the quake buckled seaside roads and bridges, and
one-meter (yard) wide fissures could been seen in the ground
along the coastline.
</P>
<P>
One of two people buried under a collapsed apartment house had
been rescued, though the person's condition was unknown, police
said. Separately, TV footage showed rescue workers and
firefighters hacking at the roof of a damaged home searching for
anyone trapped within.
</P>
<P>
A ceiling collapsed in a gym in Kashiwazaki where about 200
people had gathered for a badminton tournament, and one person
suffered minor facial injuries, Kyodo reported. The quake also
knocked a train car off the rails while it was stopped at a
station. No one was injured.
</P>
<P>
The Meteorological Agency issued tsunami warnings along the coast
of Niigata prefecture (state), but the warnings were later
lifted. Waves as high as 50 centimeters (20 inches) were believed
to have hit the coast, but no damage was reported.
</P>
<P>
The quake, which hit the region at 10:13 a.m. (0113GMT) was
centered off the coast of Niigata, 260 kilometers (160 miles)
northwest of the capital, Tokyo. The tremor made buildings in
Tokyo sway and was also felt in northern and central Japan.
</P>
<P>
The agency initially measured the quake at a 6.6 magnitude, but
later revised that up to 6.8. The U.S. Geological Survey said the
quake registered 6.7 magnitude.
</P>
<P>
A series of smaller aftershocks rattled the area, including one
with a 4.2 magnitude. Koichi Uhira of the Meteorological Agency
warned that the aftershocks could continue for a week.
</P>
<P>
Several bullet train services linking Tokyo and northern and
northwestern Japan have been suspended. Officials said water and
gas services for Kashiwazaki's 35,000 households were suspended
after reports of gas leaks, reports said. About 18,000 households
were without power as of Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, campaigning in southern Japan for
parliamentary elections later this month, was to return to Tokyo
to deal with the quake, and the government has set up a task
force, reports said.
</P>
<P>
Niigata Airport, which had suspended flights shortly after the
quake, resumed services after finding no damage, Kyodo said.
</P>
<P>
Japan sits atop four tectonic plates and is one of the world's
most earthquake-prone countries. The last major quake to hit the
capital, Tokyo, killed some 142,000 people in 1923, and experts
say the capital has a 90 percent chance of suffering a major
quake in the next 50 years.
</P>
<P>
In October 2004, a magnitude-6.8 earthquake hit Niigata, killing
40 people and damaging more than 6,000 homes. It was the
deadliest to hit Japan since 1995, when a magnitude-7.2 quake
killed 6,433 people in the western city of Kobe.
