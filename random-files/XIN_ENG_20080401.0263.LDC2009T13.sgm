BEIJING, April 1 (Xinhua)
</P>
<P>
Two suspects were arrested for their alleged involvement in two
arson cases in the recent Lhasa riots which led to the deaths of
two innocent victims, China's Ministry of Public Security said
here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The two men, both 27 years old, are named Tanzen and Losang
Gyaltsen, respectively, according to a report from the Tibet
Autonomous Region public security bureau.
</P>
<P>
"Both suspects have confessed to their crimes," said ministry
spokesman Wu Heping.
</P>
<P>
Around 2 p.m. on March 14, Tanzen allegedly participated in such
criminal activities as randomly assaulting passersby, vandalizing
properties, looting and arson in the neighborhood of Duosengge
Road in the Tibetan capital.
</P>
<P>
He set fire to several shops and used a lighter to burn pants in
a garment store named Playboy. The fire killed the shop owner's
20-year-old daughter, Liu Juan, Wu said.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, Losang Gyaltsen set fire to a pants store called
Hongyu on the Youth Road in Lhasa. His actions caused the death
of 45-year-old shop owner Zuo Rencun.
</P>
<P>
Losang Gyaltsen also collaborated with others in looting and
burning an outlet of the garment brand Metersbonwe and a Snow
Spider shoe store.
</P>
<P>
Wu said an investigation of the two was still underway.
</P>
<P>
The ministry has now made public four deadly arson cases -- those
in a Yishion outlet, a motorcycle shop, the Playboy garment store
and the Hongyu pants store -- that led to the deaths of 12
civilians.
</P>
<P>
According to the ministry spokesman, apart from the cases already
known to the public, six more people were found to have been
killed in the March 14 riots.
</P>
<P>
They are:
</P>
<P>
He Jianshu, male, 60, Han ethnic group, from the southwest
Sichuan Province;
</P>
<P>
Lhapa Tsering, male, 30, Tibetan ethnic group, from Lhasa, Tibet.
</P>
<P>
Wangdu Dargye, male, 24, Tibetan ethnic group, from Damxung
County of Lhasa, Tibet.
</P>
<P>
A male surnamed Gao, 30, Han ethnic group, from the northwest
Gansu Province.
</P>
<P>
Another two males killed in the riots have not yet been
identified. Local police were making further investigations, Wu
said.
</P>
<P>
To date, the deadly riot has claimed the lives of 18 civilians
and one police officer.
</P>
<P>
Sufficient evidence showed that the March 14 Lhasa violence was
part of the "Tibetan People's Uprising Movement" plotted by the
Dalai Lama clique, according to the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The "movement" aimed to create a crisis in China by staging
coordinated sabotage activities in Tibet, Wu said.
</P>
<P>
He said that police have captured the primary suspects who
allegedly organized, planned and participated in the violence on
March 14 in Lhasa.
</P>
<P>
"The suspects are closely connected with the Dalai clique," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The capture had led to the discovery of a domestic network of an
official from the "security ministry" of the Dalai Lama clique,
Wu revealed.
