Nigerian president returns home after long trip

Nigerian President Umaru Yar'Adua returned to the West African
country Saturday after more than two weeks in Saudi Arabia, where
he reportedly spent a lengthy stint in a private hospital,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
Information Minister John Odey told The Associated Press that
Yar'Adua landed in Nigeria early Saturday and is "strong and
well."
</P>
<P>
The opposition has demanded more disclosure on the state of
Yar'Adua's health and Nigerian media reported that Yar'Adua spent
much of his trip to Saudi Arabia in a hospital undergoing
treatment for his chronic kidney condition.
</P>
<P>
While Yar'Adua has long been known to suffer from a kidney
ailment, government officials say he traveled to Islam's holiest
land primarily as a pilgrim, although they say he has consulted
with doctors during his 16-day trip there.
</P>
<P>
But the political opposition has been pressing for more details.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian media has reported that Yar'Adua's situation is more
serious than the government has acknowledged, and that many
members of Yar'Adua's family and political allies have traveled
to Saudi Arabia to be with him. One major mass daily newspaper
reported Friday that Yar'Adua may have undergone a kidney
transplant.
</P>
<P>
Yar'Adua has made several lengthy trips to overseas medical
clinics since he became governor of a northern Nigeria state in
2000.
</P>
<P>
He also flew unannounced from the country in mid-2007,
disappearing to Germany for days, just before April 2007
elections that he won. Election observers condemned the vote as
rigged and unrepresentative of the public will.
</P>
<P>
The government has insisted during Yar'Adua's trip to Saudi
Arabia that he has been able to fulfill his presidential duties
-- apparently trying to forestall challenges to his authority.
</P>
<P>
If Yar'Adua were to leave power before his term ends in 2011, the
official reins of government would be passed to Vice President
Goodluck Jonathan.
</P>
<P>
But under an informal agreement among Nigeria's business and
political elite, presidential power should be rotated between
Nigerians from the north and the south, the country's two main
population blocs.
</P>
<P>
Yar'Adua's predecessor was a southerner, as is Jonathan,
Yar'Adua's deputy. Many fear that power passing again so soon to
a southerner would raise fierce opposition from northerners, and
potentially undermine the country's fragile political consensus.
