Hare's Play Is Ending Early

<TEXT>
<P>
David Hare's ``The Vertical Hour'' will close early at Broadway's
Music Box Theater because it is ``expected to recoup its entire
capitalization with the week ending March 11,'' a spokesperson
said Wednesday.

``In order to maintain that advantageous position for the play's
investors, the producers will end the limited engagement three
weeks earlier than originally announced (April 1).''
