EU calls for cuts in bloc ' s sugar production to avoid surplus

<P>
The European Commission on Monday called for a temporary cut in
EU sugar production to avoid surplus sugar stocks.
</P>
<P>
The 27 EU nations should cut their sugar production by 2 million
tons, or 12 percent, for the 2007-08 production year, EU Farm
Commissioner Mariann Fischer Boel said. Part of the quota for
that period will either have to counted toward the quota for the
following year, or be sold for industrial use, such as
bioethanol.
</P>
<P>
EU governments will study the proposal and decide on a new
production ceiling in October, the Commission said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
The EU reformed its sugar subsidy program in 2005, ending the
dumping of cheap sugar on the world market. The reform has caused
job cuts at refineries and forced many farmers out of growing
sugar beet and sugar cane.
</P>
<P>
Under the old system, production was supported by generous EU
subsidies and import tariffs that guaranteed and inflated price
for sugar. That will now be phased out.
</P>
<P>
EU sugar prices are more than three times higher than the global
market rate. The EU also pays out export subsidies to get
millions of tons of sugar off its market every year.
