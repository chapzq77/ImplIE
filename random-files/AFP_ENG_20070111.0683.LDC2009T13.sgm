US lawmaker offers bill restoring military draft
</HEADLINE>

<P>
A top Democratic lawmaker on Thursday reintroduced legislation to
restore the US military draft, saying that the all-volunteer army
is shorthanded and overwhelmed by current and future troop
deployments in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Representative Charles Rangel said a draft would spread out the
human cost of the four-year-long Iraq operation, which he has
said has been borne disproportionately by lower- and middle-class
Americans.
</P>
<P>
The New York lawmaker said the burden was likely to be even
greater if US President George W. Bush makes good on his plan to
increase US troops in Iraq by more than 20,000, as part of his
plan to subdue the raging insurgency there.
</P>
<P>
"If Americans are to be placed in harm's way, all of us, from
every income group and position in society, must share the burden
of war," Rangel said.
</P>
<P>
"The overwhelming majority of our troops fighting in Iraq are
young men and women who have chosen to enlist because military
service is an economic opportunity," Rangel said.
</P>
<P>
"They are motivated by enlistment bonuses up to 40,000 dollars
and additional thousands in scholarships to attend college. They
are from urban and rural communities where there is high
unemployment and few opportunities to pursue the American Dream,"
said Rangel.
</P>
<P>
"It is time that all Americans -- including the wealthy -- be
given the opportunity to prove their patriotism as well, by
saluting when the flag goes up and defending their country in
wartime. A military draft would ensure that."
</P>
<P>
Rangel first proposed legislation for the draft in January 2003
before the invasion of Iraq two months later, but it was voted
down. He again failed to win support when he reintroduced the
bill last year.
</P>
<P>
The United States has heavily depended on military reserves to
keep up staffing levels in Iraq, where more than 3,000 US
soldiers have died, and many soldiers have been pushed into
multiple tours because of the shortage of fresh troops.
