The labor participation rate of Taiwanese women has grown in
recent years and now ranks 35th in the world, a government report
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
According to analysis carried out by the Cabinet-level Council
for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD), based on data
compiled by the International Institute for Management
Development, the labor participation rate of Taiwanese women
increased to 42.45 percent last year, up from 40.45 percent in
2001.
</P>
<P>
During the same period, Taiwan's ranking rose to 35th from 38th
place, lagging behind Thailand, Hong Kong, and Singapore, but
outpacing Japan and South Korea, the report showed.
</P>
<P>
Relevant government agencies have been working on programs to
help more women find employment or open their own business, so as
to meet strong demand for manpower in many sectors, CEPD
officials said.
</P>
<P>
Generally speaking, getting married and having children are the
two major factors most affecting women's willingness to work, the
officials said, adding that when sound social systems are in
place, and society grants them equal rights, women will be better
able to take care of their families and work at the same time.
</P>
<P>
Against such a background, the issue of how to take advantage of
women's power to contribute to the workforce has been one of the
focal points in the government's human resources policy, which
aims to create more job opportunities for women and fully explore
their workplace capabilities, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
Judging from changes during the 1980-2006 period, Taiwanese
women's labor participation rates have steadily been rising, they
said, pointing out that the employment rate for married women
with children under six years old doubled, growing from 26
percent to 56 percent.
